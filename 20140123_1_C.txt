MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello and welcome to Citi's Fixed Income Investor Review with Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach and Treasurer
Eric Aboaf. Today's call will be hosted by Peter Kapp, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations. We ask that you
please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for
the question-and-answer session.
Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
Mr. Kapp, you may begin.
Peter Kapp
Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will
speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the fixed income investor presentation, which is
available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements,
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of
factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC
filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to John.

Okay. Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to be hosting our fixed income investor
review this quarter. Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will review some specifics on our strong balance sheet liquidity profile
and capital position as well as our 2013 issuance activity and current funding plans for 2014. Before I turn it over to
Eric, however, there are some key points from our fourth quarter results that I would like to highlight on slide two.
2013 was as challenging as we thought it would be. Low interest rates, changing expectations regarding Fed tapering,
and increasing legal settlement costs all had significant impacts on our bottom line. We reported 2013 adjusted earnings
of $13.8 billion and fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion, and our net interest margin was stable at 285 basis
points for the year. However, we continued to make progress on our execution priority. We improved our operating
efficiency and completed the repositioning effort announced in December 2012. We continued to reduce the earnings
drag associated with Citi Holdings and put several legacy issues behind us through settlements with Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac. And we utilized $2.4 billion of our deferred tax assets throughout the year. Our credit quality remains
stable, and we maintained our balance sheet around $1.9 trillion. Finally, our capital and liquidity remained strong, with
an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 10.5% and high-quality liquid assets in excess of $420 billion at the end
of the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide three, we've summarized Citigroup's financial results for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, we reported
$2.6 billion of net income for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $13.8 billion for the year. For the full year, revenues grew
1% while operating expenses were 2% lower. And credit costs also declined by over $2.8 billion, driving earnings
growth of 15%. We improved the operating efficiency in Citicorp in 2013 while reducing the net loss in Citi Holdings
by nearly half. As a result, Citigroup returns on both GAAP assets and tangible common equity improved year over
year.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric.
Eric Aboaf
Thank you, John. Let me start on slide four with a review of how we're managing our balance sheet to achieve our
business objectives.
First, over the past year, we've purposely held our total assets at or below $1.9 trillion while adding loans and deposits
in a disciplined manner. Second, managing a compact balance sheet has allowed us to maintain our net interest margin,
which I'll discuss more in a moment. And third, this approach allows us to operate at appropriate levels of leverage and
build towards our ROA goals.
Overall, on the asset side, net loans grew 3% year over year and 2% quarter over quarter, as demand from our
consumer and corporate customers continued to be supported by the underlying economic recovery, partially offset by
the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings. Trading assets in reverse and by contrast were down 7% year over year and
4% quarter over quarter, as we held less inventory in our Markets business. Our counterparties became cautious during
the second half of the year, as they reacted to news of Fed tapering and possible government default while also
positioning themselves for rising interest rates. Cash and investments remained stable in the second half of the year, as
we maintained a liquid balance sheet.
On the liabilities side, we maintained a diversified, stable, and low-cost funding profile. Deposits were roughly half of
our balance sheet, up 4% year over year and 1% quarter over quarter, as we maintained deposit pricing discipline. Total
long-term debt was flat in the second half of the year, consistent with previous guidance. And our equity base grew
primarily due to retained earnings and preferred stock issuance.
On slide five, you can see how our active balance sheet management has helped us maintain a stable net interest
margin. In the fourth quarter, net interest margin increased to 288 basis points, as the loan and investment yield
somewhat stabilized and funding costs continued to improve, with continued reductions in deposit costs as well as a
significant reduction in long-term debt costs. On a full-year basis, our NIM improved from 282 basis points for 2012 to
285 basis points for 2013. Loan and investment yields declined throughout 2012 and most of 2013, as the low interest

rate environment filtered through both floating rate and fixed rate assets. However, our funding costs also declined,
offsetting declining yields. Our deposit costs of 50 basis points this quarter are down 15 basis points year over year,
with improvement in both our U.S. and international deposit base.
We also saw decline in the interest expense associated with our long-term debt and more recently a step-wise reduction
in long-term debt rates of nearly 30 basis points. In particular, our debt and TruPS redemptions in the third and fourth
quarters [ph] are going to be (6:55) higher coupon securities. In addition, we have increasingly replaced maturing debt
with new issuance at more attractive levels, reflecting both the tightening of our credit spread and a growing
contribution from the lower cost debt issued in the securitization market. This lower long-term debt cost is a good
step-off for 2014.
We currently believe our net interest margin in 2014 should be at or around the full-year 2013 level of 285 basis points,
with some fluctuations quarter to quarter. This should position us well for revenue growth as we add loans and deposits
during the year.
Turning to slide six, let me summarize our loan growth trajectory. Citicorp loans increased 9% year over year
excluding FX, with growth in both our consumer and corporate loan portfolio. Consumer loans grew 6% year over
year. International consumer loan volumes increased 7% year over year, led by double-digit growth in markets such as
Mexico, Hong Kong, and India, offset by our ongoing repositioning efforts in Korea. North America consumer loan
growth of 4% year over year included the $7 billion Best Buy portfolio acquisition in the third quarter.
Corporate loans grew 13% year over year excluding FX, with 12% growth in Asia, 7% growth in EMEA, and 19%
growth in North America, which included the consolidation of a $7 billion trade loan portfolio in the second quarter.
Within our Corporate segment, Private Bank loans grew 14%, with the greatest growth in Asia and North America.
Transaction Services loans grew 16% ex-FX, with growth in each of our regions, reflecting strong origination growth
in trade finance throughout the year. Traditional corporate lending balances increased 7% year over year, as we funded
previously extended commitments. Going forward, we expect demand for new loan commitments may remain episodic
as many corporates remain highly liquid. Citi Holdings loans decreased 20% year over year due to $16 billion of runoff
and nearly $7 billion of asset sales, including sales of nearly $2.5 billion of non-performing mortgages.
On slide seven, I'd like to review the credit trends in our Citicorp consumer and corporate loan portfolios globally, so
that you can see our geographically diversified portfolios that performed over time. The top half of the page illustrates
Citicorp's consumer credit trend across our four regions. In the fourth quarter, total net credit losses declined to 2.39%
of the portfolio. We have approximately $11 billion of reserves against this portfolio, representing 18 months of
coincident NCL coverage. Credit remained favorable in North America in the fourth quarter, with the decline in the
NCL rate reflecting both underlying improvement as well as the impact of the Best Buy portfolio, which was acquired
late in the third quarter.
In Asia, credit trends remain stable. In Latin America, we saw an uptick in NCL. The higher NCL rate in the fourth
quarter primarily reflects the impact of portfolio seasoning in Mexico. Looking to full-year 2014, we currently expect
this portfolio seasoning to continue, with the NCL rate in Latin America being broadly in the range of the levels we
saw in the second half of 2013.
The bottom half of the page highlights the quality of our corporate portfolio. Non-accrual loans as a percentage of
corporate loans continue to improve, and as of the end of the fourth quarter were approximately 58 basis points for the
entire portfolio. Current loan loss reserves allocated to our corporate loan portfolio provide non-accrual loan coverage
of approximately 1.5 times.
On slide eight, I'd like to provide some additional texture around the international exposures in our loan portfolios. At
the top of the page you can see our Consumer business, where we have tailored our product offerings and geographic
footprint to best serve customers who are urban-based and globally minded. This segment, which tends to be more
affluent and grows faster than the general population in many markets, is generally more resilient through economic
cycles. We provide them with deposits and investment services and also lend to them through a mix of products, credit
cards, mortgages and personal loans, depending on market convention.

Forty-two percent of our consumer loans are in the emerging markets, with the five largest emerging geographies
representing 28% of all consumer loans. The largest of our consumer exposures is in Mexico, where we remain
constructive on the economic outlook and where we have a leading market position. In Korea, our loans have been
declining. However, NCLs have remained relatively stable at 1.2% for the past year, even as we have actively
repositioned the franchise to focus on achieving higher returns. Singapore, Hong Kong, and India are all showing stable
and 70 basis points or less loss rates, as you can see on slide 28 in the appendix.
The bottom half of the page highlights our corporate loan composition. Our clients here are top multinational
corporates as well as regional champions who value our international network and the breadth and depth of our local
capabilities. Many of our institutional relationships begin with our Transaction Services business, which is why you see
a large position in trade finance in both developed and emerging markets. The operating partnerships central to that
business also allow us to capture meaningful share of other products such as foreign exchange, capital markets
advisory, and credit extension. About half of our corporate loans are in the emerging markets. However, our focus on
diversification results in no single emerging market country accounting for more than roughly 5% of our total exposure.
We continue to believe that emerging markets GDP growth will have outpaced developed markets, even though recent
EM growth is close to what we believe is a more sustainable pace. At the same time, our carefully selected
investment-grade and affluent-oriented target markets, which we also describe on slide 26 in the appendix in more
detail, should leave us less exposed to volatility in these markets.
On slide nine, let me shift briefly to the credit trends in North America Citi Holdings mortgage portfolio. We ended the
quarter with $73 billion of North America mortgages, down 20% from a year ago, while net credit losses declined by
50% and loss rate improved by roughly 120 basis points. Here we show the breakdown of residential first mortgages
originating in Citi Mortgage versus the legacy Citi Financial business. As you can see, while loan balances and net
credit losses are declining in both portfolios, the loans originating in Citi Financial are becoming a larger proportion of
the total.
The loss rate overall for North America mortgages was 2% for the fourth quarter, down from 3.2% a year ago. The
evolving composition of this portfolio partly obscures some of the underlying credit trends. Given the borrower profile
in Citi Financial, these loans tend to have higher loss rates at around 5% versus a loss rate of around 1% at Citi
Mortgage. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgages in Citi
Holdings, or 39 months of NCL coverage. Looking to 2014, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains
favorable, we continue to expect to utilize loan loss reserves to offset a substantial portion of our mortgage net credit
losses.
Turning to slide 10, let's discuss deposits, which continue to serve as our primary source of funding for our bank. Our
overall deposits have grown significantly over the past year, in part reflecting elevated levels of market liquidity and
strong corporate balance sheets. Citi's average deposits grew $27 billion or 4% year over year in constant dollar terms,
even though we had a $26 billion reduction related to the transfer of deposits to Morgan Stanley during the second half
of the year. Consumer Banking deposits increased 2% ex-FX, as 8% growth in consumer checking and savings
balances was offset by deliberate reductions in higher-cost time deposits.
Corporate deposits increased 7% year over year ex-FX, as continued strong deposit flows led to 10% growth in
Transaction Services, notwithstanding our declining deposit pricing during the year. In addition, through pricing
actions we reduced some higher-cost deposits from our Markets counterparties in our Securities & Banking business,
offset by good growth in Private Banking. Operating account balances increased this quarter to 80% of our total
deposits, as we continue to focus on improving the overall quality of the base.
Now let me turn to slide 11 to cover our long-term debt, which is the primary source of funding for our parent company
and is also a valuable liquidity management and funding tool for our bank subsidiaries. Over the past years, we
significantly reduced our long-term debt balances as Citi Holdings assets declined and our deposit base grew. During
2013, we slowed the pace of reductions in the aggregate level of outstanding long-term debt. As you can see, we
stabilized at about $221 billion during the second half of the year.

During 2014, we expect to maintain our long-term debt at approximately these levels, so we may have small reductions
in parent company debt partially offset by small increases in securitizations activity at the bank. We have maintained a
weighted average maturity of our unsecured debt at approximately seven years to ensure the stability of our longer-term
debt funding base. As of the end of the year, we had holding company debt, preferred stock, and Basel III Tier 1
common equity equal to 23% of our estimated Basel III risk-weighted assets, consistent with prior periods, as we detail
in slide 24. While potential regulatory debt requirements have been widely discussed, we don't yet have clarity around
the exact form of the requirements, although we continue to believe we are well positioned to adapt to the proposals
being discussed. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to achieve our funding costs, liquidity, and capital
objectives.
Slide 12 provides further context for debt issuance and redemption activity at our parent company. During 2013, we
issued $19 billion of benchmark long-term debt as well as $8 billion of structured notes and local country debt. We also
exchanged $3 billion of trust preferreds for subordinated debt. In addition to the U.S. dollar, we issued in a range of
foreign currencies, euros, Aussie dollars, Japanese yen, Norwegian krone, and have maturities ranging from three to
thirty years, as we sought to diversify our funding sources and maintain a benchmark funding curve. Combined with
our maturities of $31 billion and buybacks of $12 billion, we had total net redemptions of $15 billion last year.
In 2014, we currently expect to issue approximately $20 billion of benchmark long-term debt, consistent with last year.
We also expect to issue another $10 billion of structured debt and local country debt. In addition to $25 billion of
expected maturities, we also expect to buy back or redeem approximately $10 billion of our debt throughout the year,
as opportunities arise to replace our higher coupon securities at attractive levels. This will result in approximately $5
billion of total net redemption at our parent company during 2014. As we have said, the market environment as well as
clarity around minimum debt requirements and other regulatory developments could alter our outlook.
During late 2012 and 2013, we reentered the credit card securitization issuance market, as we look to diversify our
funding sources at our bank after a multiyear absence. On slide 13, we outline our recent activities and our expectations
for securitizations in 2014. Citi was historically a very active issuer in the securitization markets across a range of asset
classes. With our rapid deleveraging starting in 2009, we created cash which in turn was used to fund our routine
lending growth and which temporarily reduced the need for securitizations. During this time, our securitization
outstandings declined to $24 billion, including $20 billion of net redemptions in 2012.
Today, we find that credit card backed debt is less expensive than our marginal term deposit rates and helps us manage
our liquidity position efficiently. During 2013, we issued $11 billion of securitizations backed by Citi branded card
receivables. We structured our offerings with a focus on a balanced maturity profile and to respond to our investor
preferences. [ph] Of the (20:10) approximately $2 billion of maturities, we had $9 billion of net new issuance in 2013.
We ended the year with outstanding securitizations at our bank of $34 billion.
Throughout 2014, we currently expect to issue $10 billion to $12 billion in the securitization market, primarily backed
by Citi branded credit cards. Factoring in $8 billion of securitization maturities, we anticipate net new issuance for the
year of $2 billion to $4 billion. Lastly, we issued $850 million of a seven-year fixed rate credit card securitization to
kick off our issuance program for the year.
On slide 14, I'll cover the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio, which is a direct result of our deposit and
long-term debt funding. We size our liquidity portfolio to meet our operating needs and to withstand a variety of stress
scenarios in addition to satisfying regulatory requirements. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $424 billion of
high-quality liquid assets, somewhat higher than the $410 billion last quarter, and an average of approximately $400
billion over the last two years.
As we've said before, our HQLA will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. As an example, our HQLA was unusually low
in the fourth quarter of 2012, driven by cash outflows and deposits related to the expiration of the TAG program as well
as routine year-end customer balance sheet changes. More recently, growth in HQLA was driven by continued deposit
inflows.

Over 80% of our HQLA as of year end is held in the form of Level 1 assets, cash, U.S. government securities, and
high-quality foreign sovereigns. Just under 20% is held in Level 2 assets, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS,
and investment-grade debt. As you know, there is a 40% cap on Level 2 securities under the proposed Basel Committee
liquidity rules, which puts a real constraint on the size of a bank's agency MBS portfolio. Our Level 2 assets represent
less than 20% of our HQLA, leaving us significant flexibility to optimize our investments for both liquidity and yield.
On slide 15, I'd like to discuss our liquidity ratios under various proposed regulations. Under the Basel LCR guidelines,
as of year-end 2013 our LCR was 117%, up from 113% in the third quarter and representing a $62 billion liquidity
cushion above the 100% proposed minimum future requirement. Our LCR calculated on this basis increased during the
quarter, principally due to the increase in our HQLA balance and improvements in the mix of our deposits.
As you are well aware, the U.S. agency has released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in October, which included
several changes to the computation of the LCR for U.S. financial institutions. First, the definition of Level 2 assets in
HQLA is more limited, especially around investment-grade credit. Second, the proposal changed several assumptions
regarding the classifications of certain deposits, [ph] S (23:33) buyback requirements, and certain repo financing.
Based on our understanding of these changes under the NPR, we believe we are still in compliance with the proposed
minimum requirement. However, there are other aspects of the proposal that are less clear, and we are working with the
industry associations and our regulators to better understand the details. Depending on these discussions, including the
formulations of net outflows and as our regulators finalize the proposal, we expect there could be additional
refinements to the proposal or to our estimates, particularly resulting from any further clarity regarding implementation.
Additionally, the Basel Committee recently released a consultative document with updated guidance regarding the
NFSR. We continue to evaluate this guidance relative to our overall liquidity position. There is a lot of detail to review,
but our initial estimate of NFSR at year end is in the 90% to 95% range. And we believe we should be able to close the
gap under the revised guidance over the next 12 to 18 months without significant changes to our current plans. Of
course, once we complete our analysis of where we are, we'll be in a much better position to judge the actions and
timeframes needed to close any gaps.
Turning to slide 16, let me summarize our capital position, which remains among the strongest in the industry as
compared to both our U.S. and international banking peers. Our regulatory capital continued to increase during the
fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in retained earnings and utilization of an additional $600 million of DTA.
However, our estimated risk-weighted assets under the advanced approaches also increased by approximately $40
billion related to operational risks. We continue to further refine and enhance our models under Basel III. And given
the evolving regulatory and litigation environment, we felt it prudent to increase our operational risk RWA during the
quarter. As a result, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under the advanced approaches remains at 10.5%. It
also remains slightly lower than our ratio under the standardized approach, making advanced approaches the binding
ratio for Citi this quarter. As you know, we must report the lower of the two ratios.
Our estimated SLR under the final U.S. Basel III rules increased to 5.4% while Citibank's SLR remained in excess of
6%. As you know, the Basel Committee updated their leverage ratio rules last week. Under the prior SLR guidance, we
estimated that the U.S. adoption of the Basel guidelines could reduce our SLR by approximately 40 basis points. While
we are still refining our estimates under the updated guidance, we currently estimate that the revised Basel proposal
could increase our SLR by approximately 10 basis points as compared to the U.S. rules. Of course, this all depends on
further analysis and guidance as well as action by the U.S. regulators with respect to the Basel Committee's guidance.
Slide 17 shows the composition of our Tier 1 capital under Basel III. On a fully phased-in basis, our estimated Basel III
Tier 1 common ratio is 10.5% and our estimated Tier 1 capital is 11.1%, both of which are in excess of the expected
minimums. Once the capital ratio rules are fully phased in, we would expect to hold up to 150 basis points in the
category of additional Tier 1. As of now, we estimate that our additional Tier 1 capital amounts to 70 basis points of
RWA, meaning we are nearly halfway to filling the additional Tier 1 bucket. To reach the 150 basis points of additional
Tier 1 by 2019, we would need to issue approximately $10 billion of additional preferred stock over the next four to
five years.

With our Tier 1 common position currently in excess of the required levels and given the remaining time to final
implementation in 2019, we believe we can issue preferred stock at a measured pace to reach our desired capital
structure. Our estimated SLR is above the proposed U.S. regulatory requirement. We believe that continued growth in
our common equity position as well as modest issuance of preferreds should provide ample cushion to this regulatory
capital measure.
On slide 18, let me comment on how we have positioned our balance sheet to respond to a range of interest rate
scenarios. Our intention is to benefit from a rise in rates while limiting the impact of changes in AOCI on our
regulatory capital position. As the economic conditions have improved since 2010, we have adjusted our interest rate
position progressively, with a goal of meaningful net interest revenue growth as rates begin to rise.
On the right side of the page, we show how net interest revenues and AOCI would change in several different interest
rate scenarios. At the top of the table, you see that if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in a parallel
shift, we estimate our net interest revenue would increase by $1.8 billion over the first year, an 11 basis point benefit to
NIM as our assets would reprice faster than our liabilities. In this scenario, we estimate that our AOCI will decline by
approximately $3.1 billion after tax, reflecting a decline in the value of our securities portfolio, partly offset by a
benefit related to our pension plan. The net effect of this change in our AOCI equates to a decline of approximately 36
basis points in our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio.
Now for two other interest rate scenarios, if overnight rates were to rise by 100 basis points with proportionately
smaller changes at longer maturities, we estimate that our net interest revenue would also increase by $1.8 billion in the
first year. Alternatively, if the ten-year Treasury yield were to rise by 100 basis points, with shorter maturities making
proportionately smaller rate moves, our first-year benefit net interest revenue would be only $100 million based on this
static balance sheet analysis. If, however, we decided to adjust our investment portfolio duration after such a rate rise,
that could meaningfully increase the contribution to earnings. While rising rates have the ability to reduce our Basel III
regulatory capital ratios through AOCI, we would expect to recover the AOCI through both increased revenues and
accretion of our investment portfolio as they roll down the curve and in approximately 18 months.
Moving to our last slide, let me summarize four major points. First, while the environment remains challenging, we
continue to make progress on our execution priorities. Second, our credit trends remain favorable, reflecting the high
quality of both our consumer and corporate portfolios. We managed our balance sheet efficiently, which contributed to
stable net interest margin of 285 basis points for the full year. Third, during 2013 we continued to optimize our funding
profile, with programmatic issuance of both benchmark debt and securitizations to support the operating needs of our
parent and bank. Our 2014 funding plans are consistent with our 2013 actions. Fourth and lastly, our liquidity reserves
and capital base remain among the strongest in the industry, as reflected in our regulatory metrics. During the fourth
quarter, Moody's and S&P acknowledged our progress by updgrading our standalone ratings.
That concludes our fixed income review. John and I will be happy to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Hi, good morning, John, Eric, and Peter. Thanks for the call; a couple of questions on
emerging markets and then on the funding side, if that's all right. First, thank you for the AOCI slide; my question is,
on past calls we've talked about in some of the emerging markets the operations. In order to maintain liquidity, you've
kept local government bond portfolios. Given what happened in emerging markets in the fourth quarter, did these take a
valuation hit at all? And how does that flow through? Is that then on the local level, or does that flow through AOCI?

<A - Eric Aboaf>: Robert, it's Eric here. You are right in describing our liquidity portfolios as both existing in the U.S.
market, in dollars as well as in foreign sovereigns. And those foreign sovereign AFS portfolios, as you know, are
funded by the local deposit base. If you think about two time periods in the fourth quarter, we didn't see very much of
an interest rate move in the emerging markets. That's different than what we saw about six months ago. If you recall, in
the second quarter there was quite a move up in interest rates in the emerging markets. And so as a result, when you
look at our impact of OCI, it's actually in the appendix on one of the – let me see the page for a moment – page 33.
You'll see that there are investment securities OCI in the bottom table. It's about $400 million.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Right.
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Most of that in the fourth quarter came about from the rise in interest rates in the United States. And
there was actually very little change from any of the rate moves in foreign sovereigns, at least on average.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. So in the future, if that should happen, that's the line we should look at then?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Yes, absolutely.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. On Korea, could you give us a little bit more color to characterize where the
restructuring is? When do you think that would be done? What other charges do you think you might have to take
there? I know a competitor of yours took a large goodwill charge in Korea. Is that something that is possibly down the
road?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Rob, it's John. We've been in the process of repositioning Korea probably for the last 18
months or so. And for the most part, the repositioning has to do with changing some of the target markets. We've
decided, as we've described in our earnings call that we did last week, moving to a customer segmentation that is much
more in line with the customer segmentation that we have elsewhere in Consumer, that urban-based globally mindset,
call it affluent or emerging affluent customer base. And so the repositioning you've seen so far has been largely with
just the books themselves and moving to that customer mix.
What we do still need to do, though, is to complete the repositioning of the branch structure so that the branches then
are more aligned again with that urban type of strategy; so again, as we have elsewhere in our various countries, have
branches much more centrally focused around the larger city. That is work that has yet to be done. And we hope to
begin – we've done some of that, but we really hope to begin more in earnest this year. We haven't discussed what the
potential is for the repositioning charges associated with that, but that's clearly something that we'll be talking to you
about later in 2014.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay, thanks. Moving on to some of the funding details, you put in slide 32 issuance over the
course of 2013. And I was wondering if 2014 issuance is – if you're looking to follow a similar issuance pattern there,
or if you're looking to front-load more issuance given where rates have gone down to and where credit spreads are.
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Rob, it's Eric. We'll address that in a way based on how the market evolves. We tend to be fairly
regular in our issuance. You don't see quarters where we issue half of the total of need for the year nor just $1 billion or
$2 billion, but we tend have some balance. But in truth, we're going to see how we feel the first quarter shakes out,
second quarter, and third quarter. And I'm not really in a position to share that with you now because it's the kind of
assessment that we do literally every day and every week when we look at the markets. What I can tell you is that we'll
be active in the markets every quarter, and it's just a matter of how much.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. And you had also talked about credit card securitizations as a main issuance vehicle for
funding the bank. Have you also reviewed looking at the senior deposit market as well?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Rob, that's a good question. We've from time to time taken a look at that as well as all possible
funding options. Right now we don't see a particularly good reason to access the senior debt market for the bank in
particular. On one hand, deposits are our lowest cost funds. Securitizations are our second lowest, and unsecured senior
in the bank would be above both of those. So economically it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, but maybe that will
change over time.

At the same time, as you know, there are upcoming rules on orderly liquidation, long-term debt requirements. And up
until now, our understanding is that those requirements are primarily for debt issued at the parent company. Maybe it
would be issued at the parent company and down-streamed into the bank, but that bank-issued senior wouldn't be
particularly useful to address those requirements. Obviously, we don't have a set of rules. We don't know yet. And
perhaps if that changes, we'll obviously factor that in.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Great, one last one, if I could, on preferreds, and thank you for giving us a rough issuance
schedule. Cost of preferreds, dividends paid have more than doubled, I guess according to the slide, to $427 million.
Given what you're looking at for issuance over the next several years, you could add another $600 million – $650
million to this and bring your annual dividend cost to over $1 billion. How do you think about that in terms of
planning? When does that become too much, and how do you factor that into your long-term cost?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Rob, it's Eric. The truth is that the preferred debt – the preferred equity, I'm sorry, that is required
for any U.S. bank is 1.5% of RWA or up to that. Obviously, you can fill it with Tier 1 common.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Right.
<A - Eric Aboaf>: There tends to be an advantage of, given where rates are, the returns on common that we can
achieve to actually have that 1.5 percentage point bucket filled with preferreds. So that's the starting point.
I think the second part of that discussion tends to be how quickly do we want to issue preferred. On one hand, we could
issue them all tomorrow. We won't be doing that, but theoretically that's possible. And then the common equity holders
would need to pay out that dividend right before we have created earnings to them, and that would not be probably our
objective. At the same time, we can wait for five years and issue them all at the very end of the time period. We're not
likely to do that either. And so that's why we're in this middle ground of issuing in a paced manner. We issued a good
chunk last year. And in the coming year, we think we'll be issuing a little less than what we did in the past year and
then continue to pace ourselves over the next four or five years.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Great, that's very helpful. Thanks for answering all my questions.
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Our pleasure.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Kehoe with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Please go ahead with
your question
<Q - Mark W. Kehoe>: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to get your thoughts around the prepositioning of any debt
ahead of OLA and maybe also to touch on the point if you do think that OLA requires some sort of debt issued at the
holding company. How do you think that debt could be deployed within the group and at the bank level, whether that
would be an exclusive portfolio that you would buy some more HQLA assets, or whether you would repay FHLB
borrowings? Thank you.
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Mark, it's Eric. Let me try to share with you what I know up to now on the question of orderly
liquidation authority and the rules or the potential rules, and then what might come out in prepositioning rules. But the
challenge with answering your question is that we actually don't have rules yet. I don't know how else to say that.
That said, if you think about it broadly because I think that's what you're asking, ultimately it looks like we're going to
have some kind of long-term debt requirement for the company, for the bank holding company. It sounds like some of
that long-term debt may or may not need to be prepositioned in either the dealer or the bank or other subsidiaries. And I
think until we know more, we wouldn't necessarily actively move debt or allocate it or preposition it in those different
subsidiaries. I think there is a range of views within the regulatory community that you've seen in some of the speeches.
Some would argue that prepositioning a little bit of debt makes some sense, some would say a little more debt. It seems
like prepositioning all the debt has some disadvantages, and not prepositioning any may not be the place that our
regulators land. But we really need to see more. And as a result, we're a bit hesitant to get out ahead of something that

Your next question comes from the line of David MacGown with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - David MacGown>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, David.
<Q - David MacGown>: A couple of follow-ups on your LCR disclosures. Eric, I may have missed it, but I don't think
you have said what your LCR looks like at the bank subsidiaries. And I'm wondering if you have an estimate of what
the 117% and the bank level looks like under the U.S. rules.
<A - Eric Aboaf>: David, it's Eric, good questions. LCR disclosure, as you saw, we had on – let me just get to page 15
– 117% in aggregate for the firm. And we don't disclose the individual subsidiaries, but you can rest assured that if we
feel confident that we should run the LCR above 100% for the firm, we also feel like we should run it above 100% for
the bank, and that's how we are running that today.
<Q - David MacGown>: I understand, and the U.S. rule impact?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: The U.S. rule impact we've done in aggregate so far. To be honest, I don't know if you've flipped
through it; it's 118 pages. So we've done the aggregate assessment for the impact of the 117%. We feel like we're still in
compliance, a little above the minimum requirement in aggregate. I've not done, to be honest, the bank-dealer-parent
split, but we think that we'd be within the range of where we need to be. We don't run with particularly large amounts
of excess liquidity in one entity that funds another entity. And so we should be within the range of generally where we
need to be.
<Q - David MacGown>: Okay. And, Eric, you mentioned the cap on Level 2 assets. Looking at your disclosures
versus some of your peers, you have relatively high cash balances, and you teased out agency RMBS. Even with that
cap, you have pretty low agency balances. Do you think there's room to optimize and generate some growth in NII as
you do that?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: David, I do think there is some room. I think the question is when and how, to be honest. If you
think about it, there are some banks out there who have very large agency MBS portfolios that are way above the 40%
limit – cap, and they're going to need to divest. I think we're in the opposite situation. We've got a pretty diversified set
of assets. Like you say, we have a lot of cash. You can see that on page 14. And we have a modest-sized agency MBS
portfolio.
The challenge in a rising rate environment is that agency MBS are very tough to run because you have an extension
risk there. You've got a fair amount of grade exposure that you need to be careful about in particular with that asset
class. So if you're looking for us to change the size of that portfolio tomorrow, I don't think that really makes a lot of
sense. But over the next few years and as rates move up to different levels and maybe stabilize at some levels, it's a
natural asset class for us or for any bank to continue to invest in. And like you said, we have cash. Ultimately, there
will be a choice around rates and value of relative asset classes that we'll make at the time.
<Q - David MacGown>: That's helpful, Eric. Thank you.

<Q - James D. Strecker>: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the call. I guess these questions would be for Eric
probably, and they're a follow-up on what Rob and Mark and even what David had asked. So last week BofA said they
could book at issuing senior bank debt out of the bank obviously, more so to help with any LCR compliance at the
OpCo versus the cost of funding advantage and any OLA concerns, et cetera. Is that part of the matrix that you guys
have evaluated potential bank issuance out of, or are you not concerned with that?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: James, it's Eric. As I just said, our LCR is very healthy for the aggregate company at 117% and
above the requirement for the bank, so we're in good shape. We don't need to do anything particularly strenuous or
different in the bank on a go-forward basis. I think if we were to continue to think about diversifying our funding
sources, which we're always looking to do, I'd look at the tiering of economics because, in the end, we want to do that
at the lowest possible cost to get the best kind of tenor construction. And we're still back to the positive spend to be the
lowest cost. After that it's securitizations, which is why you've seen us lay back into a modest and relatively important
program in that asset class. After that, we don't really see the need for unsecured at the bank, and we're not necessarily
going to go in that direction, obviously, unless some regulatory rules change or for some other reason. But we don't see
the motivation.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay, so it's purely an economic decision at this point. Switching gears a little bit, you
mentioned potentially holding up to 150 bps of [ph] unregulated (49:25) risk-weighted assets in preferreds. There is
some caution or consideration on our side about how much of the Tier 1 common buffers that everybody will
presumably run with would count towards that bucket too. Is it feasible that you could ultimately have a point or maybe
a point and a quarter versus the full 150 bps, or do you think you would optimize that to the full 150 bps over time?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: James, it's a fair question, but one I think that is hard to answer today. I think over time, we're going
to get more regulatory guidance, either formally or informally as an industry, which is it really should be filled with
preferreds or using common may be a very acceptable alternative. And then obviously, we're going to have to continue
as a firm at our end to do the optimization of, can we earn for the marginal amount of equity enough returns to offset
the preferred dividend, which we typically can. And that would encourage us then to return common equity to
shareholders and then to have that bucket more closely aligned with 1.5 points of preferreds. But I think time will tell,
and we'll learn more, and obviously we'll address over the next few years.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay. Thanks, Eric. And I guess we could apply that same answer to 2% of risk-weighted
assets and sub debt, the HoldCo debt?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Yes, same approach.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay. Last but not least, you had had mentioned some of the things you think you're
hearing and we've been applying some of the things we think we know about OLA. Any color on whether you feel
there could be a specific sub-HoldCo requirement that comes out of the rules, or are you just in the same bucket like
everybody else, waiting to see the rules?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: James, you're breaking up. The question is specific requirement on...
<Q - James D. Strecker>: A specific sub-HoldCo requirement as part of OLA, any thoughts, chatter, news on that, or
are you in the same bucket as everyone else and just waiting to see the rules at this point?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: We're in the bucket of everyone else and just waiting to see the rules. And when they come, we'll
obviously try to interpret it as quickly as possible and comment for you.

<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: John and Eric, good morning, two questions if I could, on earnings. John, on the earnings call,
you referred a couple of times to moving toward breakeven in Citi Holdings. Now we all know there are a lot of
moving parts there. But have you indicated a timeframe when you think Citi might achieve that? Are you thinking
2015, or something earlier?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Ryan, when we laid out the original target for 2015 for overall Citi both as far as achieving
the efficiency ratios that we laid out, but importantly, as far as achieving the minimum return on assets of between 90
and 110 basis points for all of Citigroup, getting Holdings closer to breakeven was clearly a part of that planning. So
we've never said and I wouldn't say that in 2015 we will have Holdings at breakeven, but that is clearly the path that
we're going down. So if you take a look at 2012 compared to 2013, in that one-year span we cut the Holdings losses by
about half. So we've made some good progress as far as getting Holdings closer to breakeven. Obviously, there still is a
ways to go, but we do have two years to do it in. And ultimately, what is going to drive that as we lay out in a
four-panel chart that is part of that earnings presentation, it's really going to be dependent on how quickly we can drive
down the legacy legal costs. That is right now the big driver in that.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then my second question is – and we touched on
international a bit before – but international Consumer. And there too I guess there are a couple of positive trends. On
the one hand, as you've indicated, Korea is stabilizing. So at least my sense is overall that should help the pressure on
the revenues in Asia. On the other hand, you're getting good loan growth in Latin America. That's a good thing, but
you're building reserves rather than releasing reserves.
So here's what I'm trying to sort out. If we look at international Consumer Banking earnings on a reported basis, they
were down about 10% for the full year. But if we exclude the effect of loan loss reserve releases, as you pointed out,
they're actually up about 2% for the year. So is it fair to assume that we should not think about material loan loss
reserve releases in the future? And then secondly, by the same token, the effect of the past reserve releases ought to be
tapering off. And I don't know what guidance you're prepared to give on this. But in terms of a reasonable expectation
for international consumer, it's a big business for you all. Low single-digits growth, is that realistic?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We've never really laid out the growth targets from a net income point of view. So I don't
want to – and nor do we usually give forward guidance. But your observations are pretty spot on. The way I look at
international Consumer right now, we have for the most part moved past reserve releases in the international Consumer
business.
And so in thinking about that business on an ongoing basis, it should be one that is driven by – ultimately once we get
past the stabilization of Korea, it's a business that should be driven by the drivers, to be simple about it. You should
actually see, as we grow the loans, you should anticipate – and again, it's going to depend upon the interest rate
environment in each of the countries, but those loans should generate additional revenue. We should get net interest
revenue off of the loan. Obviously, the asset management fees and the wealth management part of the business will be
a little bit dependent on market environment. But you should see revenue growth along with loan growth. Along with
the loan growth then, you're going to see some need to build reserves because as the portfolios grow, we will need to
increment the reserves, not because of declining credit quality but just because the portfolios are expanding. And then
as we're doing that, we will begin, we will grow those loan portfolios, again with the same credit discipline that we've
been showing.
So you can make your own assessment as to where the NCL rates are going, but we've given some near-term guidance
that certainly looking out into 2014, we see that as somewhat stable as to where we've been. So the NCL should be
somewhat stable. LLRs will need – loan loss reserves will need to grow in association with the growth in the portfolios,
but that growing portfolio should produce expanding net interest.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Okay, great. Thanks, John, that's helpful. I really appreciate it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem.

Your next question comes from the line of Pri de Silva with CreditSights. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Good morning, gentlemen. If you turn to slide 12, the $20 billion of benchmark debt that you plan
to issue next year – or this year, does that include any preferred stock, or that's not part of this equation?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Pri, it's Eric. On page 12, and I think the corresponding page would be page 11, where we have the
stack of the long-term debt, we're only capturing the debt structure. The preferred stock is obviously an equity account
instrument.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: And then if you turn to slide 17, the comments you made about up to $10 billion, I think in my
calculation it came closer to $11 billion of potential preferreds that you could issue. I just want to make sure that does
not include any changes in RWA.
<A - Eric Aboaf>: That's right. The estimate we gave was based on the existing RWA. We did that because RWA has
actually been relatively flattish over the last year within a band, and we don't expect a lot of growth. And so we thought
that would be the simplest way to do the estimate or you.
