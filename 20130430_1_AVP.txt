MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Holly and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to Avon's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks,
there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over to Amy Chasen,

Amy Low Chasen
Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Avon's First Quarter 2013 Results. With me today on
the call are Sheri McCoy, Avon's CEO; and Kimberly Ross, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Sheri will make
some introductory comments and then Kimberly will take you through our results and provide color on our outlook.
Then, we'll have our usual Q&A session.
With that, I refer you to the cautionary statement in today's earnings release, as well as to our non-GAAP

Thank you, Amy. Good morning. By now, you've seen the press release with Avon's first quarter results. We continue
to see signs of stabilization and are making early progress in our cost savings efforts, but there remains a lot of work to
be done across our businesses, particularly in the United States. This morning, I will speak briefly about our first
quarter performance. Kimberly will then take you through a detailed review of the first quarter and then we will open
the line for Q&A.
As we look at the first quarter, we are making progress toward our turnaround in some important areas. Overall
performance from our two largest regions, Latin America and EMEA, showed improvement. Within those regions, we
had encouraging results in Brazil and Russia and we are working hard to ensure that they're on a sustainable path to
recovery. We're also pleased with Mexico's overall performance and have seen improved performance in some of our
Central and Eastern European markets.
We've made more progress in reducing costs on our path to deliver $400 million in savings by 2016. And I'm pleased to
say that the cost savings actions have been implemented with minimal disruption to the business, due to the hard work
and commitment of our associates. We've also improved our financial flexibility, by taking additional steps to enhance
our capital structure. Kimberly will provide more detail on this in her remarks. And we've reorganized the Global
Marketing organization to more effectively build our brand and executive product category strategies. The new
structure provides better alignment between the global function and our top ten markets. This will give us global
consistency and efficiency. At the same time, it assures that we have local insights built into our plans.
So overall, we're making progress, but please remember that Avon's turnaround will take time. There are parts of the
business that have not yet begun to stabilize. Our business in the United States has been a challenge and it continues to
decline. As I've said before, stabilizing Avon's U.S. business is not a single fix. We are taking a holistic approach and
looking at all aspects of the business. To start, we need to restore field health. We are still witnessing the negative
impact and disruption from our redistricting efforts. We need to get this fixed and put behind us. We need to rebalance
the earnings opportunity and product portfolio, so that Avon representatives are confident that they will get a good
return on the time they invest with us.
We also need to focus on strengthening the brand, improving our marketing and merchandising and creating better
access. We have to make better progress in the United States and we are committed to making the critical decisions
necessary. On a related note, we are continuing to explore our strategic alternatives for Silpada.
We also saw a decline in our Asia Pacific region, primarily driven by China. In China, as I outlined at CAGNY, we are
focused on supporting the retail Beauty Boutique owners to help them build their businesses. The team is working
aggressively with our Beauty Boutique operators, but it will take some quarters for us to begin to see improved results.
Getting all four of our regional business units on solid footing is critical to our success.
I recently spent time in the EMEA region and thought it would be helpful for you to have some additional insight into
that region, particularly some of the strategic and operational changes we made in the business there. As you know, just
before I joined the company, Avon merged two business units, WEMEA and CEE, into a single regional business unit,
EMEA. As I took a close look at the structure, it was clear that there were benefits in terms of operating efficiency. But
it was also a large region with very diverse markets. So it was important to ensure that we had the right resources at the
local level and the right management teams in place at the key market and cluster level. We are pleased with the
approach of our integrated EMEA structure and are working to realize the efficiencies and best practices.
Over the past year, the integrated EMEA team has made good progress. We've refined our cluster structure to better
align like markets and like consumers. We've put new leadership in the U.K. market and strengthened the leadership
team in several other markets. We've exited one under-performing market, Ireland, and we've also restructured or
streamlined operations in some of our smaller markets and clusters. We've reallocated marketing resources from the
regional hub to reside in key markets where they are close to the consumer and representatives.
We've implemented new approaches in the Central European and Eastern European clusters, where we have 100%
online ordering and new service and delivery models that better meet the needs of our representatives. And we've made
significant improvements in supply chain efficiency. We completed the modernization of our Garwolin, Poland

manufacturing facility and transferred production from Germany to Garwolin, which now supplies the majority of the
region. The transformation of the site resulted in increased production capacity, improved service delivery, enhanced
associate safety and better cost control, all completed with no disruption to quality or service.
I visited Garwolin on my recent trip and was really impressed. This was a very large and complex project that was well
executed. And it's a good example of the type of initiative we need to do to drive simplification across the organization.
And I was extremely pleased to see the team's commitment to safety, quality, and the development of their people. A
priority for the EMEA team is reducing volatility and ensuring consistent performance across all key markets. We have
a strong team in place and they are on the right track.
Looking forward, 2013 is a pivotal year for Avon. The entire organization is working with a sense of urgency and we
are aligned against our strategic framework. The first part of that framework is executing our growth platforms. Growth
will come from innovating our consumer proposition, transforming the representative experience and optimizing our
geographic performance.
The second part of the framework is driving simplification and efficiency. This includes our cost savings initiative, but
it also includes taking complexity out of our business and modernizing our IT infrastructure. The final part of our
framework is improving organizational effectiveness. While the executive team is largely in place, we're focused on
further improving our bench strength, driving accountability and instilling a one team mindset.
We are also ensuring that the representative is at the center of our business, where she belongs. By focusing on these
three areas, growth, simplification and efficiency, and organizational effectiveness, I'm confident we will continue to
make progress and return Avon to growth.
Before I hand it over to Kimberly, I wanted to briefly discuss some changes to the composition of our Board of
Directors. As we stated in our press release last Friday, Fred Hassan has stepped down as Director and Chairman of the
Board. Doug Conant has been elected as non-executive Chairman of the Board and Doug joined the Avon board in
early 2012 and I'm looking forward to working with him in his new role.
Fred's resignation would have brought the number of Directors below the minimum required by our bylaws, so
Kimberly has agreed to serve on the board until we complete recruitment of a new, independent director, at which point
she will step down.
I'll now hand it over to Kimberly for [ph] her review (9:10) of the first quarter results. Kimberly?
Kimberly A. Ross
Thank you, Sheri. As Sheri indicated, we are pleased that the early signs of progress we witnessed in some parts of the
business in Q4 are continuing. But at the same time, we still have quite a bit of work to do in order to generate
sustainable performance across the business. For the quarter, our constant dollar revenue was unchanged. On a reported
basis, revenue was down 4%, negatively impacted by currency.
In a continuation of recent trends, we saw positive growth in Latin America and EMEA, offset by weakness in North
America and Asia. Units declined 3%. This was driven by weakness in Beauty in all regions, except EMEA. We are
disappointed with this unit performance and it is a high priority for our team to drive units.
Price mix was up 3% in the quarter. Strong Fashion and Home performance was a factor, given the high price points.
Also, the increase was driven by Latin America, where we took inflationary pricing, as well as some selective price
increases in Beauty. Active Representatives were up 1%, largely driven by increases in Latin America and EMEA.
Active Representatives in North America declined double digits and in Asia were down 4%. Adjusted gross margin
was up 160 basis points to 62.5%, largely due to lower freight and material costs, including benefits from productivity
initiatives.
Adjusted operating margin was up 450 basis points to 8.3% in the quarter. Note that we had several non-reoccurring
benefits contributing to the quarter one operating margin performance compared with a year ago. These contributed

about 130 basis points of the 450 basis point increase and included a 60 basis point benefit, due to: last year's provision
to increase bad debt reserves in South Africa; a 40 basis point benefit associated with our 2012 management incentive
plan, which paid out less than planned; and 30 basis points in Brazil from a government tax incentive.
In addition, there was another 150 basis point benefit from a combination of high levels of advertising in Brazil last
year and an easy comparison in EMEA, given adverse supply chain and currency in Q1 2012. Therefore, the rate of
improvement will be less over the next several quarters. Nonetheless, there were some operational improvements,
including the higher gross margin and lower administrative expenses, primarily due to lower legal expenses. Net
brochure costs were also down, as we continued the improvement we witnessed in Q4. These cost reductions are a
result of initiatives that are part of plans to achieve our $400 million cost reduction goal. Adjusted EPS was $0.26 per
share compared with $0.10 a year ago.
With that said, let me move to the regional discussion. Starting with Latin America, revenue rose 7% in constant
dollars, driven by increases in Active Representative and growth in average order. Units were down 2%, driven by
Venezuela, Argentina and, to a lesser extent, Brazil. Beauty units were down, while Fashion and Home units were up.
Price mix in the region was up 9%, largely due to inflationary pricing in Venezuela and Argentina, as well as mix,
given the stronger performance of Fashion and Home relative to Beauty.
In addition, we took some selective price increases in Beauty in Brazil. Brazil constant dollar revenue was up 11%. We
had a two point benefit in Brazil, or one point for the region from a government tax incentive, the vast majority of
which won't repeat in future quarters. But underlying growth in Brazil was still strong at 9%, with Active
Representative growth of 4%, benefiting from continued appointment growth, as well as retention programs. Average
order also improved, due to a higher net unit, resulting from selective price increases in Beauty, as well as mix, due to
the strong Fashion and Home performance.
In Brazil, Fashion and Home revenue was up 26% in constant dollars, with continued benefits from the more effective
pricing and improved merchandising we instituted last year. Constant dollar Beauty revenue was up 5%, driven by
Fragrance and Personal Care. Fragrance benefited from several new launches relevant to the Brazil market, including
[ph] Candy, Auwudibidesus and Resabrunet; (14:00) however, we still have work to do to improve the image and
positioning of our fragrances and our brand perception.
Service is also improving in Brazil. And we continue to focus on driving steady progress in the near-term. We have
changed the team and improved the processes and we are focused on driving accountability. While we are encouraged
by the progress we've made over the past two quarters, competition remains intense and our Beauty growth is not
where we want it to be in Brazil. We are also focused on strengthening brand health, by delivering a stronger, more
relevant product portfolio, but this process will take time. Continuing to drive the Brazil recovery remains a key
priority for our team.
Growth in Mexico was a bit better than we expected, despite the impact of Easter. The 3% constant dollar growth was
driven by strength in Fragrances, including [ph] Candy, Infinite Seduction and Latin Attitude (14:59). Active
Representatives were also up due to improved activity.
Venezuela was up 3% in constant dollars. The growth was driven by pricing, which benefited average order; however,
both representative growth and units were down. The economic and political instability remains high, which continues
to impact consumer confidence, resulting in reduced activity.
Latin America adjusted operating margin was 9.9%, up 510 basis points, largely due to lower advertising, primarily in
Brazil, given very high levels of spend in Q1 2012 in support of new product launches. Net brochure costs were also
lower. And we made good progress in managing our administrative expenses, as well. Gross margin benefited from
lower freight cost and the positive impact of the government tax incentive in Brazil. We feel good about the progress in
Latin America, particularly in Brazil. However, we are still faced with a difficult external environment in Venezuela
and Argentina and competition across the region remains high. The team remains focused on driving continued
improvements in all aspects of the business and are ensuring that progress is sustainable.

Moving to EMEA, revenue increased 3% in constant dollars, driven by Active Representative count and supported by
both units and Beauty growth. Russia revenue increased 4% in constant dollars, driven by strong Active Representative
growth of 6%, which is a significant improvement from recent trends. The team in Russia has put in place an attractive
continuity program that rewards representatives for consecutive orders each campaign. And in quarter one, this
program helped drive activation and retention.
In addition, Russia is seeing early benefits from our efforts to drive more locally-relevant innovation and brochures.
We put a local commercial marketing team in place in Moscow last year-end and while it's still ramping up, we are
starting to see early signs that its efforts towards locally-relevant products and marketing are benefiting results. Lux,
our new high-end color line, is a good example, and continues to perform well after its initial launch in quarter four.
U.K. revenue declined 8% in constant dollars. The decline was due to lower Active Representatives. As we have
indicated to you in the past, we've had executional challenges in that market and have recently announced some
management changes, including a new General Manager. It will take time to improve performance in the U.K., but we
now feel confident that we have a highly capable team in place that will address the issues in the medium-term.
Turkey revenue declined 2% in constant dollars, as we continued to see volatile performance in this market. We
continue to work to identify the key problem areas and opportunities. And where appropriate, we started to take action.
For example, we're improving our campaign planning, aimed at reducing volatility over time. However, the base will
drive volatile comparisons for the remainder of the year. Adjusted operating margin in EMEA was 16.5%, up 810 basis
points, primarily due to higher gross margin. This is primarily due to lower material and overhead costs, including the
benefits from productivity initiatives. Some of this was due to adverse supply chain and currency in Q1 2012. In
addition, operating margin benefited from lower bad debt expenses, primarily in South Africa, given the one-time
negative adjustment in Q1 2012. Net brochure costs were also lower. We are encouraged with the progress made
to-date in this region, and the team is focused on sustainability going forward.
Turning to North America; as Sheri indicated, this region remains challenging and reported a 15% revenue decline. We
have several issues in the U.S. For one, Active Representatives continue to decline. This is in part impacted by
comparisons, given that we won't fully lap the redistricting until quarter three. But we also have other challenges. As
we've mentioned in the past, we need to strengthen the field. We also need to improve our innovation, marketing and
merchandising program so that consumer pull helps drive the business. Adjusted North America operating loss was
$5.4 million, primarily due to revenue deleverage. Gross margin also declined, impacted by Silpada. The U.S. remains
one of our greatest challenges. It is a large and complex market, and it will take time to execute the corrective actions in
a thoughtful and cohesive way.
In Asia Pacific, revenue declined 12% on a constant dollar basis due to a continued weakness in China, as well as
weakness in the Philippines. Active Representative count declined 4%. Note that we no longer include China in the
calculation of Active Representatives, as it is predominantly a retail model. China constant dollar revenue was down
31%, with weaker trends earlier in the quarter and some recovery towards the end. Our China team has identified the
management skills necessary to manage, train and work with the BB owners and we are starting to see progress in these
relationships, but this, too, will take time as we rebuild the trust and, at the same time, work to really build the health of
the brand.
Philippines revenue declined 6% on a constant dollar basis, which was disappointing. The business is proving to have
both field and operational challenges, including service. And we are taking corrective actions to address. Adjusted
operating margin was 8% in Asia, up 70 basis points. This was largely due to lower administrative expenses as well as
a benefit from lowering selling expenses, primarily in China, due to the transition to a retail compensation model.
Now I'll take you through three adjustments we had to our GAAP results in the quarter. First, we had charges
associated with our cost savings initiative. We recorded total cost to implement restructuring in the quarter of $20
million, primarily related to our most recent cost savings initiative. This includes the closure of Ireland, as well as
restructuring in some small markets.

Second, as a result of the Venezuela currency devaluation, we recorded one-time charges totaling $64 million. These
largely reflect the write-down of monetary net assets and deferred tax benefits. In addition, there was a negative impact
as a result of using the U.S. historic dollar cost basis of non-monetary assets, such as inventory, and this impact should
continue into quarter two and quarter three. Lastly, in addition to the above items, we recorded a loss on
extinguishment of debt of approximately $73 million before tax.
Moving on to cash flow, operating activities used $119 million of cash during the quarter compared with $33 million in
quarter one 2012. The increase was due to the make-whole premium on the private placement notes, higher payments
for employee incentive compensation, restructuring and higher inventory levels compared to year end.
Working capital operationally improved 13 days. Inventory improved two days operationally, driven by excellent
inventory management in EMEA. Accounts payable improved 12 days operationally, due to continued focus by our
global team.
We also had some positive impact of timing of payables. As you know, during quarter one, we successfully completed
certain actions to improve our capital structure. Our primary objectives were to improve financial flexibility, extend the
maturity profile and reduce the dependence on floating rate debt, which were accomplished when we finalized the debt
offering in March and raised $1.5 billion. With this, we have increased the fixed rate portion of our debt from
approximately 30% to 70% and we have extended the weighted average life of our long-term debt from 3.5 years to
over eight years.
We also entered into a new four year $1 billion unsecured credit facility to replace the facility that was going to expire
this year. Over the next month, we will complete the repayment of approximately $1.9 billion in debt using the bond
proceeds, along with cash on hand. In Q1, these repayments included: the March 1 bond maturity; the private
placement, which was restricting our financial flexibility; and the repayment of $380 million of our $550 million term
loan. On April 15, we redeemed the $500 million 2014 note and we will repay our May 2013 bond at maturity. We are
pleased with the outcome of these refinancing activities and have now successfully addressed our capital structure,
positioning us well to focus on our turnaround.
Now, I'll provide you with an update on our cost savings initiatives. We continue to make progress towards our $400
million cost savings goal. To-date, we have announced charges associated with achieving approximately $125 million
in savings, related to: global head count reduction of more than 1,900 associates; the restructuring of certain smaller,
under-performing markets; and the exit of South Korea, Vietnam, and Ireland.
In addition, the organization remains focused on other short and longer-term initiatives to drive costs down, in order to
achieve the $400 million cost reduction goals. These don't necessarily have a restructuring charge associated with them
and includes initiatives, such as: reducing administrative expenses, including legal fees; freight in Latin America; and a
recent action we took in the U.K. to move our pension program from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution
plan. We are pleased that we continue to make progress with these initiatives and that we started to witness some cost
savings this quarter. We continue to work towards this goal and we will update you as you go.
Looking forward, our strategy and focus areas remain the same. We are focused on driving sales, operating profit, and
cash flow improvement. We continue to manage to a very conservative level of revenue growth and we remain
diligently focused on our costs. In terms of quarter two, we expect similar trends in overall sales. Adjusted operating
margin should be up from Q2 2012, as we continue to make progress, but a much more modest rate than in Q1.
I know it's easy to extrapolate current trends, but please remember that some of the margin expansion we witnessed this
quarter was due to one-time items and comparisons that I discussed before. In fact, we expect the rate of year-over-year
change in operating margin expansion to flow for the remainder of the year, though we continue to expect modest
improvement for the full year.
This is consistent with my prior indication that, in my experience, turnarounds tend not to be linear, so you may not see
a straight line recovery quarter-after-quarter, in terms of the growth rates for both sales and margins.
With that said, now, I'll turn this back to Sheri for a few closing remarks.

Sheri McCoy
Thanks, Kimberly. So in summary, we're seeing some progress, with pockets of the business showing early signs of
stabilization. While we anticipate that there will be some bumps along the way, we're confident that the company is on
the right track and that we will continue to make progress.
I'll now open the line for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question. And, as a reminder, you are allowed one question and a related follow-up question.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Good morning.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Can you just talk about the FCPA costs, because I looked in the 10-K and they went from
sort of $23 million to $7 million this quarter. Is that just a timing thing or is this $7 million the new run rate? And
should we read anything into this thing getting resolved sooner rather than later, given the big reduction in the cost
associated with it?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah, Bill, thanks for asking. This is Sheri. As we look at the FCPA, as I said earlier, we have a
new team in place, led by Jeff Benjamin and some external lawyers helping us out, as well as strong internal staff, and
we're continuing to make progress. It is going to take time for us to get resolution and we're still in that process, so we
can't really comment on that. I would not assume that this is a run rate, because as we go on, we're still in the process of
working with the government. So I don't think it would be fair to say that, but I do believe that we're going to continue
to look at how we can get effectiveness and efficiency out of our negotiations looking forward.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Okay, thanks. And this is – I'm going to try to make this related, but it's not really a related
follow-up. The advertising spending level, you know, you're the only direct seller, at least a public one, that actually
advertises, or [ph] has Berkleys advertised (29:15)? I mean, as you think about advertising spending longer-term, do
you think you really need it? Shouldn't the catalogues be your advertising and your representative?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: I think it depends on what market we're in and where we land with household penetration. So if
we have heavy household penetration in some markets, what we see is that advertising does, in fact, help grow our
business and grow our brand. So I think we have to be smart about that. What I will say is we have an opportunity to
really strengthen our brand component.
In some areas, where we've walked away from advertising, we've seen a negative impact on our brand. So we're
continuing to look at that. You do see that we did not spend as much this quarter as we had in 2012. We do have new
launches and some other things planned for the second half, so we're revisiting that, the advertising component. I will
also say that we also have to get smart about how we use media. So digital advertising, for example, is much less
expensive than TV. So we'll continue to look at the right media mix.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question. And as a
reminder, you are allowed one question and a related follow-up question.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Thanks. It's Bank of America. Hey, guys, I guess you've talked in the past about sort of a
lesser visibility into the rate of return on investments and how investments in RVP weren't generating an acceptable

level of return. So I just was wondering, have you pulled back on what you view to be the low-return activities already?
And how would you characterize your visibility into the rates of return you're earning on your investments?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. Go ahead.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. This – as we say, this is an area we really focus on. And I think what I've said in the
past, is we really need to ensure that we're getting the best return on the money that we're spending today. I think we
still have a lot of work to do in this area. I think we have in different pockets of organization addressed some
inefficiencies there. But, with that said, I think we still have quite a bit of work to do, including a robust standardized
measure for return on those investments across the organization, but definitely something that we're looking at as part
of the overall spend and we look at that of what we're spending in the field in conjunction with the advertising spend
also.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Got it. And I guess you guys called out supply chain costs being 250 basis points better
in the Q. And I know some of that is a year-on-year swing in commodities. But what's your view on where structural
supply chain costs are now? I mean, like is the base structural supply chain cost where it should be or is it – on a
normalized basis? Is it a normalized place or do we expect it to pop back up again?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: I'm not going to whether we expect it to go up or down. What I will say is that we are
continuing to look at that, both from a structural perspective, as well as there's been an initiative in the past with regards
to negotiations on direct cost. And that's something that we continue to focus on, too. So, and, obviously, we have –
Sheri talked about what we've done in Poland, with regards to consolidating Germany into the Polish facility. And
during our recent visits there, it's very much front and center with regards to gaining additional efficiencies. And I think
we'll continue to look at that across our supply chain.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Thanks, Chris.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. It's Barclays. You guys mentioned 100% online ordering in Russia, was
curious, I guess, one, how new that is? And two, what sorts of implications there are from that beyond just that reps
place orders online? How quickly are things processed? Has there been anything else put into place, like a mimicking
of the SMT that you're starting to pilot in Canada? Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. So if we look at Russia and I'll point out Poland, as well, and some of our Central European
markets. In the last 18 months or so, a number of them have gone 100% online. And what we're seeing, particularly in
places like Poland, they've done a fabulous job working with the Polish Postal Service. And they have a – they have
parcel post, where they basically now have about 85% of their orders going through the Postal Service or parcel post
for people to pick up. And so people can get it within 24 to 48 hours. So they've done a fabulous job of being very
creative in looking at how they can be more accessible and available to the – their representative.
They've also done a good job of putting their brochure online and activating through social media and digital media. So
what we're seeing in some of the markets that are about – they're about 20 years old, so they have different IT
infrastructure, making it a little bit easier to make some of the changes. If you look at some of our legacy markets, like
a U.S. or Brazil, we have very old IT infrastructure, so it makes it more difficult to do some of the things that we're
doing. But we're very encouraged by what we see there and I think that's something that we can continue to look at as
we move forward.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: And can you just explain sort of the getting to 24 to 48 hours for delivery? I mean,
how much of that is like – and I know you mentioned Postal Service. Has it just been the difficulty of getting product
out to where people are ordering from or is it that orders are now being able to be processed quickly and they couldn't
before and that's an IT issue and that's where we get back to the – how old things are in the U.S. and Brazil?

<A - Sheri McCoy>: Lauren, it's a combination of all of the above, so we need is an end-to-end component that –
actually, so we have the ordering, so people can see it immediately. Then we have the distribution center set up in a
way that they can deal with that turn and that speed and so it's a combination of IT, as well as the supply chain and
getting those things working in harmony and connecting the dots are really, really important.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Morgan Stanley. So I wanted to focus on top-line, the organic sales growth remained
muted in the quarter, on an overall basis, despite some of the progress in a few of the key markets. Can you discuss,
going forward, the key strategies you're implementing to reinvigorate that top-line growth? And, in particular, do you
think you'll need to reboost spending behind the business, as we look at the balance of the year and beyond, just given
the ad and RVP spending was down significantly year-over-year in this quarter and it seems like there is clearly a more
competitive environment in Beauty, as well as direct selling, in general, here?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. I think one of the important things is that as we look at the top-line growth component, it
really starts with innovating the consumer proposition and making sure that we have the right product and pricing and
the right support for that. So what we see, as an example, in the U.K., when we came out with our [ph] A-F-33 skin
care product into surround sound (36:29), we saw very, very strong performance. I think they have the best growth that
we – best new product, I think, in ten years. What we need to do is bottle that and do more of that across the world.
And so what we see is some of our markets is that we have not yet achieved the focus on what we need to do from a
category innovation standpoint and the supporting marketing. So in terms of your question about, do we have the right
money in the right places relative to support that, I think we have opportunity to get a better understanding of return on
investment between what we're putting against the field and how we're marketing our product. And that's really an area
of focus for our new CMO, who is looking at how do we continue to do that. So besides driving the consumer
innovation piece, we also need to make sure that we're making it easy for the representatives to do business with us. So
those are really the primary areas of focus for us to drive growth. But we're – and we're very committed to that.
I think we saw good progress this quarter in the work by our Latin America teams on Fragrance, where they really
looked at a local approach, put the right support behind it. The area that I'm probably the most disappointed in, in terms
of our overall performance, is Skincare, because if you look at our products, I mean, we have terrific products. I mean,
I feel very good about our innovation. We have to do a better job of how we market it, how we deal with the brand
architecture and how we manage pricing. So these are things that we can fix and we will fix, but it's going to take time
to get there in the different markets.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. So it sounds like you don't anticipate a big boost in spending behind the business
going forward, because you can get greater efficiencies from what you're already doing and improve the execution and
innovation. And then also, you stole my follow-up question, which was just on Skincare. Can you talk about
specifically what drove the weakness in the quarter and if it gets better going forward, because it was a pretty weak
result in the quarter?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. As I've said, we're disappointed in it. I think it's a bit complex, because if you look at the
market, North America and Asia, those are – and China specifically – those are two big skincare markets and when
they're not performing on – for a whole host of reasons, it impacts Skincare and it impacts units. So we have that issue
going on. At the same time, we've been very focused in [ph] upper mass, (38:45) which is our strong suit, ANEW.
But as we launch new products and new innovation, we've seen a lot of – it has not been incremental, so we've seen a
lot of cannibalization because of the positioning of the products. So we're actually taking a look at the brand
architecture for Skincare at the high end. And what we see is we do a reasonably good job at the low end with our
Avon Care line. In the middle, the mass tier, which is really where you see a lot of volume, we have not been
consistent. So we've restaged our Skincare brand a number of times and not really been able to position it uniquely in

the market, nor uniquely relative to ANEW or Avon Care. And so that's really a focus of our marketing team, to get
that clarity, working in concert with the regions, the top ten markets, and really look at how we focus on driving
Skincare. So an important initiative for us, and the Executive Committee's very focused on that.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi. I'm from Bernstein. I was wondering if you could help a little bit assuage some fear that I'm
hearing investors have and, frankly, I have, about the fact that many of the things you're doing help results in the
short-term, like kind of giving up on Asia, growing non-Beauty, reducing brand support, relying more on Brazil,
becoming more MLM, not really delivering cash flow yet. It's kind of contrary to what, I think, many of us feel Avon
needs to do to win in the longer-term, like succeeding in the Asian emerging markets, driving Beauty in particular,
upgrading the brand, diversifying outside Brazil, keeping your multiples away from MLM-type companies, actually
delivering cash. So this contrast is weighing on peoples' minds and want to get a sense of how you think about that
balance and that contrast.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Thanks, Ali. As we've said, we've been very focused on stabilization. And that's why we've really
put together a three-year plan, because it's going to take time to address some of the challenges that we face. And we've
had challenges for a number of years. It really starts with the consumer proposition and making sure that we're getting
the right offerings for the consumer.
As I look at Asia Pacific, because you specifically referenced that; to me, I think we have a tremendous opportunity
there. We have to stabilize China and we're very focused there. We had some challenges in the beginning of the
quarter, particularly, with some concerns. When we shut down South Korea, there was concern in the Chinese market,
as we were making changes there, that we were exiting the business, so we had some issues there. What we're seeing is
much stronger performance coming out of the March timeframe, so we're starting to see some traction there, which is
important.
We're very committed to Asia Pacific and, from my standpoint, it's really getting the right resources against that, and
we will focus there. But, as we make choices and we put together our strategy, we felt it's critically important that we
focus on stabilizing our big markets, and that's really where we've been putting our energy, getting our cash position in
the right place, and Kimberly and her team have done a very good job of extending our debt maturity profile to make
sure that we are getting the cash that we need to turn around the business. So I think it is a turnaround. It's going – we're
going to have our bumps along the way, but I'm very confident that we have the right team in place. We'll put in the
right management in local markets and then we're going to deliver on our goals, so thank you.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. And you mentioned big markets. The U.S. and U.K. clearly still having struggles and I do
wonder whether, at this point, it might be a good idea strategically to, frankly, let it shrink, so get more down to a
focused group of representatives and consumers and kind of not fight the trend. And when you're at a point where you
are stable from a good group, kind of grow from there – or is that completely ridiculous and you have to spend more
money, very much to your point. You have to get management focused on those markets, because they are just so
important, because they drive margins, et cetera. And if I can actually just throw in one totally unrelated, but
clarification question, on that 2% in Brazil from the government tax. If you get to that at some point, that would be
helpful, just because I'm getting a lot of questions on it, and I don't know what to tell people. Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Okay, I will take the U.S. and U.K. comment and then I'll turn it to Kimberly for the tax question.
So on the U.S. and U.K., both important markets. U.S. is largest Beauty market in the world. It's an important market
and it certainly has the Avon heritage. What I see is, what success looks like for us, is to stem the decline and really get
it to a position where we're strengthening the profitability. So what we want to make sure we do is, invest in the
growing markets and where we see growth opportunities, so we are making choices about how we're spending against
our different markets.

I think success to me in the short-term is to stem the decline in the U.S. We're giving time. We're giving time for the
U.K. business to also look at how they're going to improve their execution. But we're really in it for the long-term, and
what we need to do is get things stable and then look at how we invest for the long-term and invest in markets like
Asia, that we talked about, and look at entering new markets. But we're not going to do that until we fix the existing
business. And today, frankly, the U.S. is a drain on the overall business. Thanks, Ali.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: And I'll just take the Brazil question real quick. So the Brazil item is a VAT tax that we
received related to – a refund of a tax, I should say, or benefit – related to the Cabreúva facility. And so we got a
one-time benefit that took place in quarter one and we'll continue to get some benefit in future quarters for a few years,
but it'll be at a much, much, much lower rate than what we had in quarter one.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yeah. Thanks. It's Stifel. So maybe first question on China; just a question of semantics. It
sounds like then Avon is no longer a direct selling company in sort of the broader context. I guess, am I right in terms
of how that sounds and, if so, does that change your approach to the market? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Sure. The majority of our business today is in Beauty Boutiques and so it is
more of a retail model, where the entrepreneurs there buy product and then sell to their customer base. We've been
investing in helping support their business through new signage, helping them reposition their stores and really working
with them on pricing strategies so that they can earn more. So that's the majority of our business.
We have a very small portion that is remaining in direct selling, but they have a different product line and it's very
small. So I would almost call it a test market, if you will, relative to the size of what we have for the Beauty Boutique.
So we have not exited direct selling, but we have a smaller group and that we're evaluating that and testing that as we
look to stabilize the existing business, because that's really how we built the business. That's where the brand is. That's
where the consumer is. And what we hear is that the consumers want to go in and touch and feel the product.
We have had some issues over the last four or five years, so we need to do some work to rebuild our brand and stabilize
before we can build. So we're not saying we're moving away from direct selling. We're saying that it's a smaller
portion, we're going to let that sit on the side while we fix the retail part of the business.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Going forward, would you potentially embrace selling into more – or putting products into
more traditional retail doors, beyond just your Beauty Boutiques? And then, just a related question to a prior question,
thinking about the shift into selling expenses from marketing longer-term, is there a target around where selling
expense as a percentage of sales could or needs to be, considering where some of the other direct selling companies
are?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Okay. I'll take the first part, and then I'll turn it over to Kimberly for the second part. On the – as
it relates to looking at more traditional retail, we don't see that as a core strategy today. Where we're focused is on
stabilization. So we're really looking at our core on direct selling, or, specifically, in the case of China, our Beauty
Boutiques. With that said, you see a lot of companies looking at that Omni presence. We'll continue to evaluate that
moving forward, but right now, that does not make sense for us, and we're staying very true to our knitting, so to speak.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: And then, just if we look at the selling expenses in the market, starting off, first of all, I'll
just re-enforce that we are very much looking at this as selling and marketing, and the returns that we get on those
combined. I think it's difficult to do a direct comparison to some of the competitors: A, because we might have
different business models; but also because we operate in different countries. So we have not laid out a target as a
percentage of sales. Obviously, internally, that's something that we monitor very closely. And so I don't think, at this
point in time, we'll be giving you a target on that.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Thanks, Mark.

Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: BMO Capital. Good morning. I'm interested in your opinion on discounting. Once you
discount to get rid of excess inventory, what do you think the right level of discounting is for the brand? How high has
it – what percent of sales are normally sold on discount? And how deep are those discounts? And what do you
understand the impact of discounting to be on brand equity?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. One of the things that we know is that discounting does, if it's not done well, can have a
negative impact on brand equity. And we've seen that in a couple of our markets where we over-relied, I think, on
discounting and it impacted brand equity. And a good example of that is China, where, particularly in the Chinese
market, they're very focused on higher price means higher quality. And we see that in some markets.
I think we have some opportunity to really strengthen our pricing capabilities and be much more strategic about how
we use discount. So I think in cases we went too far, that doesn't mean that we won't have promotion or opportunity to
get people excited about that and that we will have a level of discounting, but at times I do think that we've gone too
deep in discounting, which has, obviously, an impact as it relates to the profitability piece, but it also impacts our brand
equity. So this is an area that Patricia, our new CMO, is working closely with the heads of the regions to look at, how
do we put pricing corridors, how do we better understand that, but we need to build our capabilities market-by-market
and really make sure that we're understanding that, so that we can get that balance – and it's easier said than done.
You've seen many of our friends in retail and people around the world struggle with getting that balance right, so we
have to be careful about that, but I do believe there's an opportunity to strengthen our pricing and strengthen our brand.
Thanks, Connie.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Joseph B. Lachky>: Hi. It's Wells Fargo. I kind of wanted to get back to the redistricting in the U.S. and get your
opinion as far as what evidence that you guys are seeing that things are improving, I guess. Your first strategy being
stemming the decline, I guess everything we're seeing from our side appears that things are worsening. And at what
point do you reconsider that strategy, or are you waiting for the third quarter, where I guess you're lapping
comparables, as far as representative growth? If you could comment on that, please.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure, and redistricting, as we look at it, has broad components to it. So some of it is around the
literal redistricting, where we're assigning new representatives to different sales leaders. But we also made some
significant change in terms of the roles and responsibilities of our District Sales Managers versus our Sales Leaders.
And we're still struggling with that, to be honest, where we have some District Sales Managers – we have a lot of really
good ones, but we don't have the whole field in the right place relative to that.
So you asked, are we going to wait. Well, we're certainly not waiting. We're actively involved in this change
management process, but it's a huge change management component. And certainly, I think we would have liked to
have seen better traction at this point in time, so we're very focused on making sure we're helping with the roles and
responsibilities, as well as helping with the recruiting effort.
So we – I think, to Kimberly's point earlier, her – she mentioned that in third quarter, we will see that, so you'd expect
that the comparisons wouldn't be as tough. With that said, we still have a lot of work to do to stabilize the field, and
we're not where we need to be. So it's one of these things where, there was a lot going on in the U.S. market when we
implemented this, starting back, I guess, late 2011. And we've had different iterations. And so it's one of these areas
where it's a huge change and very – we're asking people to do very different jobs. And it's going to take some time for
us to settle.

<Q - Joseph B. Lachky>: And then I guess a follow-up on China. You're – obviously, it shrunk the business, or the
business has shrunk organically over a number of years, roughly a third of the size that you were maybe five years ago.
And I guess changing it to like a retail perspective model, from a margin perspective, do you guys lack the scale to, I
guess, have good margins in that area? I mean, how do you look at it from a margin perspective in China?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Just so we're all on the same page, our initial business, when it was larger, it was more of a
retail business. So we actually had a business in place that was essentially retail. When we tried to move it over to
direct selling is where we had some of the challenges in the business. We got into channel conflict and the business
declined. As we look at the margin, if we look at costs even in this quarter, the group there is making good progress as
it relates to the margin for this, because, again, it's not a traditional retail. We're selling to Beauty Boutique owners,
who – and they invest in their store. We help support them to help them promote Avon. But they're really investing in
their store. And so it's more – it's not a traditional retail. And it's not traditional direct selling, if that makes sense. So
from a margin standpoint, we have good expectations that it will be an attractive business for us, assuming we can
continue to get the scale and drive the growth.

Your next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Hi. B. Riley. So I guess I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more on the
Brazilian market, just in terms of the competition, because I know Natura also mentioned that they felt that it – the
marketplace had become even more competitive. So are we talking about competition from the traditional retail
channel? And so, are things changing in the market? And also, I think that a number of the beauty, like Estée Lauder,
Elizabeth Arden, have partnered on various projects with marketing certain products, with a direct seller in partnership.
Have you considered doing more of that, in terms of partnering with another party, or would that just not be to your
benefit at all in that market? Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. Brazil, obviously, a very, very attractive market, we're seeing a lot of competition, both in
direct selling, as well as from retail. One of the big players there is [ph] Ardivacario, (54:28) which is a franchise model
that has come into direct selling. And they've done – if you look at how they've driven their fragrance sales, it's very
impressive. We see people investing a lot more in advertising there, as you look at the more traditional brands. So it's a
highly competitive market.
We're focused on, obviously, the stabilization aspects, but we also recognize that it's going to require innovation and
branding focus to continue to make sure that we're competitive in that market. And so as it relates to your question
about would you partner, we would never say no, we're not going to partner. It would have to be a win-win and it
would have to be something that would allow us to continue to drive our Avon brand. So we will always look at
opportunities, but, again, it would be with the understanding that it drives growth and it's a win-win partnership
perspective. Thanks, Linda.

<Q - Javier Escalante>: Consumer Edge Research. I just would like to go over your comment about not needing to
increase advertising or RVP spending, at least not to hurt margins, as I understood it earlier. Your – basically, your
top-line is flat and basically you are in a market that basically is growing up 6% to 7% in terms of the Beauty category.
So shall we expect – how are you going to get to improve your top-line without either increasing field expenses or
increasing advertising expenses? And as related to that, if you can comment on the sustainability of your cost savings,
given that the disruption in the U.S., some of this disruption is because of the head count reduction in District Sales
Managers, so you also comment on the need to strengthen the field. So I'm trying to understand what seems to me kind
of like opposing comments on your side.

<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Well, thank you, Javier. That is Kimberly. As we talked in CAGNY, we didn't really say
that we needed to increase or decrease the overall selling expenses in advertising. What we did say is that we need to
get a better return on every dollar we spend. And we used examples where our incentives in some markets are very
confusing and, in some cases, may not be really driving behavior. And so how do we simplify some of what we're
doing in the market and how do we make sure that we're getting the best return for every dollar spent, including
advertising? You know, what we have done last year is really starting to test some of the advertising in market, making
it more relevant in the individual markets, to make sure that we get a better return, overall, from the spend that we have
in the markets.
And then if we look at the cost savings, clearly, the objective here is to make it sustainable. I'll point out that the
redistricting that was done was actually an initiative that was embarked on before. We actually started the cost savings
initiative, but, with that said, as Sheri pointed out early, one of the key things is making sure that we have the right
training in place and to make sure that people are – that we have the best capabilities in those positions and make sure
that they're trained to do the job that they're in. So I think that's the area where we need to spend a bit more time to
make sure we're getting the right outcome from the District Managers.

Your final question comes from the line of Leigh Ferst. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Leigh Ferst>: I'm with Wellington Shields. Good morning. Could you discuss your approach to reviewing the
brand and how that works in a cost cutting environment and whether that includes celebrity endorsements in the future?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. So we have a new Chief Marketing Officer, who has come in and really hit the ground
running and is looking – has done a lot of work looking at our brand characteristics and brand health in different
markets and looked at some of the things that we need to be doing as it relates to the brand. And as you might imagine,
we are in different places in different markets in the world, in terms of how people perceive it, although it still stands
for a brand that people love, a lot of optimism around the brand, very good foundation, but we have opportunity to
improve it.
What we see as an opportunity in some markets is to use celebrities to strengthen certain aspects of our brand, so it may
for Avon, but it might be, for example, Fergie, is a good example, where we would have Fergie as our celebrity
endorsement. I think what we see the bigger opportunity is, rather than have a global celebrity approach, is really to
look at a local celebrity approach. We want the hierarchy and the architecture of the brand to be consistent globally, but
how we execute against that, we will look at different avenues. And that's where I see us using celebrity endorsement,
versus looking at the highest levels on a total basis.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: And if I can just add to what Sheri said, and what we've seen in a couple examples of that is
that frequently those local celebrity, not only is it more relevant and more effective, but it's a lower cost than some of
the global celebrities.
