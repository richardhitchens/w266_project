MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are
in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's
website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union
Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.
Lance M. Fritz
Thank you and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call.
With me here today in Omaha are Beth Whited, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and
Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1.2 billion for
the second quarter of 2017. This equates to a second quarter record $1.45 per share which is up 24% over last year.
Total volume increased 5% in the quarter compared to 2016. Carload volume increased in four of our six commodity
groups, led by a 17% increase in Coal and a 15% increase in Industrial Products. The quarterly operating ratio came in
at 61.8% which was a record for the second quarter and is a 3.4 percentage point improvement over the second quarter
of 2016.

In addition to the increase in volume, positive core pricing and solid productivity were key drivers of the margin
improvement. Guided by our strategic value tracks, our entire team is focused on providing an excellent customer
experience while safely and efficiently delivering on our innovative productivity initiatives. I'm pleased with our results
through the first six months and look forward to continuing our momentum through the remainder of the year. Our
team is going to give you more of the details on the second quarter, starting with Beth.
Elizabeth F. Whited
Thank you, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was up 5% driven primarily by Coal and
Industrial Products, with offsets in Automotive and Chemicals. We generated positive net core pricing of 1.5% in the
quarter, with continued energy-related and Intermodal pricing pressure. Despite these challenges, we remain committed
to achieving core pricing gains that offset inflation and align with our value proposition. The increase in volume and a
6% improvement in average revenue per car drove an 11% increase in freight revenue.
Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our six business groups. Ag Products revenue gained 7% on both
a 3% volume growth and average revenue per car increase. Grain carloads increased 11% with continued strength in
weed exports driven primarily by shipments to the Gulf and Mexico. Domestic corn volumes were up 5% from
increased Midwest processor business and strength in the Mid-South poultry market. Grain product carloads were down
3%, primarily due to a reduction in soybean oil shipments resulting from soft biodiesel production. Partially offsetting
lower volumes were higher ethanol shipments driven by strong export demand to Brazil and China.
Food and Refrigerated volumes were up 3%, driven by continued strength in sugar shipments, as well as support from a
healthy summer demand associated with the brewers and beverage market. Looking at the rest of the year, high global
production of both feed grains and wheat, coupled with a lower quality domestic wheat harvest will create head wins in
our export markets. As always, we're keeping a close eye on the weather to see what the domestic corn and soybean
crops will yield.
We expect Food and Refrigerated shipments to grow from our Cold Connect service, sustained strength in sugar and
import beer trending with consumer demand.
Automotive revenue was up 5% in the quarter on a 1% increase in volume, and a 6% increase in average revenue per
car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 4%, primarily as a result of softer vehicle sales leading to reduced
production and shifting product mix. These changes were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and Mexico
production growth. The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 16.6 million vehicles in the second quarter, down
3% from second quarter 2016.
On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand drove a 2% increase in volume. The
U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for full year 2017 is 17.1 million units, down 2% from the 2016 record rate of 17.5
million. We remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to current sales trends, high inventory and rising interest
rates. The reduced SAAR will impact both finished vehicles and parts with a potential offset in over-the-road
conversion opportunities.
Chemicals revenue was up 4% for the quarter on a 2% decrease in volume and 6% increase in average revenue per car.
Petroleum and LPG shipments declined 20% as we continued to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were
down 84% to about 2200 carloads in the quarter due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity.
Chemicals volume excluding crude oil was up 2% in the quarter.
Plastics carloads were up 6% due to low commodity prices which drove increased polyethylene and PVC shipments.
Fertilizer was up 13% driven by increased potash exports. For the second half of 2017, our Chemicals franchise is
expected to remain stable. Strength is anticipated in Plastics with new facilities and expansions coming online.
Coal revenue increased 25% for the quarter on a 17% increase in volume and 7% improvement in average revenue per
car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin and other regions were both up 17% from higher natural gas prices and

stronger West Coast exports which benefited from favorable global economics for Western U.S. coal. Overall, Coal
stockpiles were down in the quarter and are now below the five-year average.
Looking forward to the second half of the year, Coal volumes will face tougher year-over-year comps, but we expect
absolute volumes to be sustained sequentially if natural gas prices and export demand are maintained. As always,
weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.
Industrial Products revenue was up 24% on a 15% increase in volume and an 8% increase in average revenue per car
during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 73% in the quarter, driven by 128% increase in sand shipments due to
improving well completion and increased proppant intensity per well. Specialized Markets volume increased 20% in
the quarter, driven by a 29% increase in waste shipments due to West Coast Remediation projects.
Looking forward, we anticipate frac sand volumes to stay strong, although new in-basin brown sand mines might
temper the upside. We see growth in military and wind shipments with an offset in roofing and cement volumes due to
year-over-year comps associated with weather-related reconstruction and changing market dynamics. Intermodal
revenue was up 3% on a 2% increase in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic volume grew
2% in the quarter, driven by parcel growth as well as improved truckload market demand in the last half of the quarter.
International volume was up 2% in the quarter from stronger West bound shipments and inventory restocking. Looking
forward, we expect international Intermodal volumes will continue to be impacted by an ever-changing global supply
chain. For the domestic market, implementation of electronic logbooks will provide opportunity for additional
over-the-road conversions.
To wrap up, this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of 2017 mentioned in the previous slide. Over-the-road
conversions will continue to present opportunities for growth. We also anticipate continued progress in our Plastics and
Food and Refrigerated markets. Our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth this year as the U.S. economy
continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains
fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.
Cameron A. Scott
Thanks, Beth, and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personal injury rate increased to
0.76 versus the first half record of 0.70 achieved in 2016. The team remains fully committed to finding and addressing
risk in the workplace and I am confident in our efforts as we push towards our goal of zero incidents. With regards to
rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 4% to 3.01.
While TE&Y training and infrastructure investments continue to be key pieces of our derailment prevention strategy,
advanced data analytics will help us make even greater strides towards identifying and mitigating risk.
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 5% versus 2016 to 2.27, as our grade crossing assessment
process in collaboration with the public continues yielding positive results.
Moving on to network performance, our network performance fell short during the second quarter which is reflected in
the metrics we report each week to the AAR. Second quarter velocity was down 5%, and freight car dwell was up 4%,
when compared to 2016. Severe spring weather across our served territory, along with several service interrupts and
outages were the primary drivers of the decline in service metrics.
Looking at our resources, although our TE&Y workforce was up about 500 employees in the second quarter when
compared to the same period in 2016, we were able to effectively leverage the robust 5% increase in volume, with
numerous productivity initiatives we have underway.
Partially offsetting some of this productivity, however, was an increase in the workforce to help manage the network
disruptions and outages I mentioned earlier.

In addition, our engineering and mechanical workforce was down more than 1,000 employees, driven primarily by
fewer employees required on capital projects as a result of the productivity initiatives we have implemented.
All in, our total operating workforce was down almost 600 employees in the quarter, or 2% when compared to last
year. As always, we continue to adjust our resources as volume and network performance dictate. In addition to being
agile with our resource base, the team's persistent focus on productivity continues yielding positive results in other
areas, such as train size. An example of our relentless focus on productivity is how we have achieved best-ever train
size in our manifest train category for eight straight quarters.
Our team uses data analytics to dynamically adjust our service schedules to maximize train length while balancing our
customer commitments. We're also able to generate productivity gains within our terminals as cars switched per
employee day increased 5% during the second quarter. Overall I'm pleased with the productivity we've been able to
realize thus far and I'm looking forward to further improvement as we move forward.
To wrap up, as we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy will continue to generate positive
results on a way to an incident-free environment. And we will continue leveraging the strength of our franchise to
improve operational performance with a focus on productivity and providing an excellent customer experience.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight, Jr.
Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.3
billion in the quarter, up 10% versus last year. Higher volumes, an increase in fuel surcharges and positive core price
all contributed to the increase in revenue for the quarter.
Operating expenses totaled $3.2 billion, up 4% from 2016. The increase in fuel cost represented a majority of the
increase to the operating expense in the quarter. Operating income totaled $2 billion, a 21% increase from last year.
Below the line, other income totaled $43 million, down from about $77 million in 2016, which included a $50 million
real estate gain that we reported last year.
Interest expense of $179 million was up 3% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt
issuance over the last 12 months.
Income tax expense increased 20% to $701 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings.
Net income totaled almost $1.2 billion, up 19% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a
result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a record second quarter earnings
per share of $1.45.
The operating ratio was 61.8%, a 3.4 percentage point improvement from the second quarter last year. The combined
impact of fuel price and the surcharge lag benefit drove a half point improvement to the operating ratio and a $0.06
tailwind to earnings per share in the second quarter versus last year.
Turning now to the top line, freight revenue of $4.9 billion was up 11% versus last year, driven by a 5% increase in
volume, along with positive core pricing. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $234 million, up $147 million when compared
to 2016, and up about $22 million from the first quarter of this year.
The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was a positive 1%. The primary drivers of this
positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand shipments and grain carloadings, partially offset by an increase in
Intermodal volumes. Core price improved to 1.5%. While we have experienced an uptick in pricing, as expected, we do
caution that we are continuing to see competitive pressures in our Coal and Intermodal businesses. Excluding Coal and
Intermodal, pricing in our other business lines was in the 2% to 3% range for the quarter. For the full year, we continue
to be on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our rail inflation costs.

Turning now to the operating expense. Slide 21 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter.
Compensation and benefits expense increased 3% versus 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a combination of
higher wage and benefit inflation, along with higher volume. We still expect full-year labor inflation to be about 5%.
Partially offsetting higher volumes were solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, resulting in total
workforce levels declining 2% in the quarter versus last year, or about 800 employees. Fuel expense totaled $434
million, up 25% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 10% increase in gross ton miles drove the
increase in fuel expense for the quarter.
Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 3%, while our average fuel price
increased 17% to $1.69 per gallon. Purchased services and materials expense increased 5% to $597 million. The
increase was primarily driven by volume-related costs, partially offset by lower joint facility expenses.
Turning now to slide 22, depreciation expense was $525 million, up 4% compared to 2016. For the full year 2017, we
estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 4% to 5%. The increase is primarily driven by higher
depreciable asset base, including our Positive Train Control assets put in place to-date. We estimate that depreciation
on PTC assets will be approximately $130 million in 2017, increasing to around $150 million in the outyears post
implementation.
And with respect to PTC, in addition to depreciation expense, as we have previously mentioned, we expect the
remaining expense line items to increase about $150 million to $200 million annually, once PTC is fully implemented.
Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $273 million in the quarter, which is down 5% when
compared to 2016. Lower locomotive and freight car lease expense and mix of traffic were the primary drivers for the
reduction. Other expenses came in at $219 million, down 10% versus last year. Lower environmental, personal injury,
and other costs were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2017, we would expect other expense to
increase slightly, excluding any unusual items.
Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first half of the year totaled about $3.5 billion, down 2% when
compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit, which more
than offset the increase in net income. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled
about $18.4 billion at quarter end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 1.9
times, which is close to our target ratio of just under 2 times.
Dividend payments for the first half totaled $980 million, up from $925 million last year. In addition to dividends, we
also bought back around 15.3 million shares, totaling over $1.6 billion in the first half, an increase of around 26% over
last year in terms of dollars spent. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased over 30% of our
outstanding shares. In between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $2.6 billion to our
shareholders through the first half, which represented about 118% of our first half net income.
On the productivity side, our G55 + 0 initiatives yielded around $110 million of productivity in the quarter. This is an
improvement over the $90 million that we achieved in the first quarter, and brings our first half total to around $200
million. This benefit was realized across three major categories. The first is network and train operations. This includes
things like increasing train length and reducing recrews and other TE&Y related expenses. The second category is
equipment. This includes efforts such as using fewer locomotives and freight cars, resulting in reduced equipment
maintenance costs. And the third category consists of support, supply, and safety, where there are multiple
opportunities, ranging from improving fuel efficiency to reducing purchasing and other administrative expenses. With
these results, we continue to progress as expected, and we are on track to meet our $350 million to $400 million
productivity goal for the full year.
Looking forward, we still expect full-year carloading growth to be up in the low single-digit range. Third quarter
carload should strengthen somewhat from the second quarter, although they will likely be closer to flat year-over-year,
given the more difficult 2016 comparisons. And this is particularly true for coal.
I also want to mention a couple of one-time items that will impact the third quarter. First, we will see a one-time
increase in tax expense totaling about $0.04 of earnings per share, to reflect a recent increase in the Illinois state income

tax rate, and on the plus side, we will receive a settlement totaling approximately $0.05 earnings per share as a
resolution of an ongoing litigation matter. This amount will be recognized as other income below the line.
With positive full-year volume, positive core price and significant productivity benefits, we are on track to
improvement our full-year operating ratio. And longer-term, we are intently focused on achieving our targeted 60%,
plus or minus, operating ratio on a full year basis by 2019. And we remain committed to reaching our goal of a 55%
operating ratio beyond 2019, as we continue the momentum of our volume, pricing, and productivity initiatives.
So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thank you, Rob.
Looking at the second half of the year, we expect uncertainty in some economic sectors and continued strength in
others. Overall, as Rob mentioned, absolute business volumes should be stronger in the second half than in the first
half, although year-over-year comparisons are going to be more challenging. In this environment, we'll focus on our
growth opportunities. In addition, we'll continue to make progress on our G55 + 0 initiatives, as we work to make
Union Pacific a stronger, more efficient company. We are confident these efforts will generate top-line growth, margin
improvement, and greater returns for our shareholders.
With that, let's open up the line for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please
proceed with your questions.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Morning, guys.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Morning.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So, wanted to just clarify some of the comments on Coal being flat sequentially. Are you
saying that the third quarter average is going to be the same as second quarter? Because we've never seen that, so I just
– I'm not sure I follow what you're trying to say.
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: No. We weren't saying that. Sorry if that was misinterpreted. No, we would expect third
quarter to follow a traditional pattern and be up sequentially, but relatively flat to last year.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay, flat on a year-over-year. Okay, that makes a lot more sense. Okay. And then, Rob, just
for you on the pricing side. I know it's not an area where you typically like to forecast specific numbers, but maybe just
some insights. We saw it tick up a little bit this quarter. Do you think that – is it reasonable to expect that that trend of
kind of rebound continues into the back half of the year, just given the better volume environment, or tough to have
visibility to that at this point?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Scott, we're going to continue to price to market and drive as positive price as we
possibly can. And, as you know, we're going to stay away from giving a specific pricing number, other than to reiterate
that we expect to yield above inflation-dollars. But, we also pointed out, Beth and I both did, that we continue to face
pressures in the Coal and Intermodal groups. So, we'll see how all that plays out.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: And just given the better volume environment, I understand the competitive comments, does
the broader market feel like it's better from a pricing standpoint, just given you've had a few quarters now of volume
growth? Or you not ready to say that?

<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: I would say that there are a lot of competitive factors going on out there. On the plus side,
we are seeing truck prices just beginning to firm, and that gives us some hope that that will continue throughout the rest
of the year, especially with ELDs coming online. But the other competitive factors that we see in Coal and Intermodal
aren't easy, so, you just kind of have to make your own prediction about what you think might happen.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Last just quick follow-up, how about in just grain, with grain prices going up, how does that
impact the way you think about grain tariffs going forward?
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: Well, let me see how to answer that. I would say that we certainly want to price and get
value in the market at every opportunity. Grain prices going up will hopefully bring more volume to us and provide us
with a revenue opportunity, and we'll have to see how the pricing opportunities play out from that.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator
The next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Ken Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Just following up on the pricing side, on the increased coal pricing you
were talking about, are there major contracts up for bid that you're seeing this get more intense? Is this more a
commentary on a shift of export coal? Just want to see given that your easy comps that you had now start to get a little
tougher, I want to see where that's heading toward.
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: Are you asking a volume or a price question?
<Q - Ken Hoexter>: It's price, but I want to understand what's leading into that price competition. Is it that you are
seeing more new – or more bids going on right now, major bids that where you're seeing your competitors step up? Is it
because of the export side? Just want to understand where you're seeing that pricing competition.
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: I think that – we continue to see competition kind of across the book of business, but we
aren't at any sort of an unusual level of contract negotiation during this period. It's just kind of when you think about
our whole base and the contracts that we negotiate over time, as we are renegotiating contracts, the market is still very
competitive.
<Q - Ken Hoexter>: Yeah. And nothing on the export -
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: No, the export business, as you know for us is relatively smaller. And we have had some
nice opportunities that – that's not as – I mean it's certainly still competitive, but that's not where we're seeing the most
pressure.
<Q - Ken Hoexter>: Great. And then for the follow-up, this is great detail, Rob, on the productivity initiatives that
you've provided here. Is this – when you look at the equipment side and the like, is that – do you see the locomotives,
are you increasing the amount that you're parking as far as the productivity and the cars? Can you talk a little bit about
kind of where that stands? You've given those numbers in the past.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, let's let Cameron address that.
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: Several years ago, we started an initiative on our low-horsepower fleet, and that initiative
netted about 500 locomotives that we've put into storage. Some of those have been sold. Some of those were leases that
we returned. We've turned that same group of employees towards our high-horsepower fleet, and I don't think we'll
achieve quite 500, but there's plenty of opportunity for us to rationalize what we're doing with our high-horsepower
fleet.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I want to say, Cameron is referencing there from this point forward. He's already got – what is
in the neighborhood of 1000 high-horsepower locomotives in storage as we speak.

Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, just to follow up on the
Positive Train Control comments. Rob, that was very helpful to give us some more details. I'm wondering if you can
just clarify one thing. Are those costs included in your long-term OR guidance? I assume they are, but just want to
confirm. And then we hear a lot about the cost, but what are some of the benefits, maybe, Cam, that you think could
come out of the system when it's fully operational?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, let me quickly address the cost question, Brian. Yes, that all of those costs are
embedded in our targeted 60% OR by 2019 and 55% beyond. So, those are challenges that we have to overcome, but
they're embedded in the thought process. And in terms of the benefits.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Cam?
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: We're implemented about 40% of our network at this point. And the technology is working
very well. There will always be glitches and bugs that we need to upgrade, but so far, it's a very solid technology. As
we get fully implemented, we'll be looking for every productivity and efficiency that we can squeeze out of that system.
I don't have anything right now to report to you on that.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Giving you a little bit more Technicolor. This is Lance. The PTC foundation gives you an
umbrella of communication capability because of what's required for PTC in and of itself, and it puts a lot of
technology and computing power on to our locomotives that, at some point, could be used for other purposes in the
future. It's important to note that it's not – when we think about productivity from the Positive Train Control
foundation, we're not talking about taking what already exists and somehow redeploying it in a way that's highly
productive. Whatever we do is likely going to require an incremental, either capital or operating expense investment,
and we'll make those decisions based on the returns that would be generated from whatever those projects are. So, it
forms a foundation in your mind. Think about that foundation as a robust umbrella of communication capability and
computing power. And from that point forward, maybe that's a foundation we can use for further productivity.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Okay, great. Thanks. That's very helpful. And just the timing, I know we've got one-year
extensions possibly across the board for the industry. If you could just remind us when you – what's the current
prospect for going fully online? Is that a 2020 event?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: We're going to be fully implemented, or installed and able to implement, that is turn on on
every mile that's required, late in 2018. And then the way the law's written, if we're in that position, then we can
basically request of the Department of Transportation an extension to 2020, which we will do because we'll want to use
that time to debug the system. While Cameron has mentioned that the system is operating and is functional and doing
what it's intended to do, it still has bugs that rob us of precious capacity, and so we'll want to take those two years to
continue to debug the system.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on the hiring front. And we saw the team being
up almost the same percent as volume, I realize there is some, perhaps one-time items in there, but, just in general,
Lance, could you tell us what you're seeing trends in hiring? There are some pretty big chunks of growth coming in
areas that might be a little bit more regionalized, like – perhaps like coal, and flat to down slightly in other areas. So,
how hard are you finding it to get ahead of those recoveries and meet demand, kind of just in time with the training
programs you have? And should we expect this long furlough for the freight recession to really kind of rob you from
some productivity, as you probably might not get all the same people you had back with maybe a little bit lower level
of experience when you do start to hire again.

<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Brian, let's unpack that in three pieces. The first piece is, you're right. With TE&Y head count
up 4% in the second quarter versus volume up 5%, that's not quite the kind of productivity we'd expect. I think that's
accountable to the weather and service-related interruptions and a little bit more sluggish network, as Cameron pointed
out. And he and his team are working diligently to get that back.
The second point that you were asking about was overall hiring and what's going on in that world. Recall, we came into
the year with a fair number of TE&Y employees on furlough. So, the first thing we do is we call them back from
furlough or from their alternative work and training board service. We've been doing that and we've also, in certain
pockets, had to go out and start up the hiring class. That's a relatively small amount in comparison to the amount of
employees that we're bringing back on furlough.
And in terms of are we able to find employees when we do need to hire, the answer is yes. In the TE&Y craft we have
very attractive jobs and in the areas where we want to hire with maybe one or two very specific exceptions, we can find
the employees that we need.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for all of the detail. Appreciate it.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yep.

The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - David Scott Vernon>: Hey, good morning. Cameron, a question for you on the productivity side. You mentioned
there was some network disruptions that added to incremental head count, and I'm just wondering if you can kind of
dimension that for us, and then also speak to the ability to kind of keep pushing forward with some of these train length
initiatives and yard productivity initiatives as volume growth moderates in the back half of the year?
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: I'll start with train size. Our team, as we mentioned during -eight straight quarters, has
demonstrated the capability to find additional opportunities on train size while meeting customer commitments. And
there is, as I mentioned before, still plenty of headroom in almost every train category in our business, with the
exception of Coal. So, there is still a lot of opportunity ahead of us on productivity with train size.
In relation to some of the outages, probably the best example I can give you was an unfortunate barge strike to one of
our key network lanes in Louisiana. We've been out for seven weeks now rebuilding that bridge. That has caused us to
weal our transportation plan around that outage, adding costs, adding locomotives, adding employees that were not
intended as we started the year. We should get that key route back in service here in the next week, and that will
normalize, not only our cost structure, but our customers will see a more solid service that they expect from us.
<Q - David Scott Vernon>: And in terms of sort of dimensioning that in terms of numbers around either extra heads or
impact on earnings, is there any way for us to think about what it could have been here in the second quarter versus
what it was because of some of these one-time things? Or is it too small to try to adjust out?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: David, let me, this is Rob, let me try to answer. I mean, we're not going to break that
out. I mean, it's kind of in the mix and we admit, as Lance indicated, that the ratio of 4% versus a 5% volume is not
what we strive for, but exactly what could it have been is hard to put a fine point on.
<Q - David Scott Vernon>: Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, Beth, with regards to ELDs, what are you hearing
from your Intermodal partners? And what kind of impact they're expecting from this, not only just in the U.S.
implementation, but I also understand there's some speculation that the Mexican government may follow with an ELD
set of guidelines into 2018 as well.
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: I don't have a comment on the Mexico piece. I haven't talked to anybody about that at this
point. So, that will be a good follow-up for me. But, I think everything you read says that they expect full ELD
implementation to be a kind of 3% to 5% sort of capacity impact. I think some people are skeptical about how well it

will be enforced. And so, you've got a range in there in terms of how much impact it will have, but certainly we're very
optimistic that it's going to help drive some tightening in the truck market and consequential price increases with rate
increases in trucks, which will give us an opportunity to convert more volume and hopefully get some price of our own.
<Q - David Scott Vernon>: And we should start to see that into the back half of this year and into next year? Or is
there going to be a bigger lag?
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: It feels like it's a pretty late into the fourth quarter event and more of a next year item.

Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning, thanks. So, frac sand has obviously seen strength in the last couple of
quarters, so I was hoping you could give us an indication of the mix of white and brown. And, I guess more
importantly, given some of the expectations for the Permian to be self-sufficient with local brown sand, how do we
think about that with respect to your volumes and mix going forward?
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: So, currently we would say, and you can read different people say different things that the
Permian is roughly 15% brown and 85% white sand, and there's a demand this year, call it 28 million or 29 million
tons. You see estimates going into next year where there are proposed mines that would bring on anywhere from 20 to
40 or 50 million tons, and perhaps demand in the Permian being in that 40 million to 50 million tons. I'm not sure how
quickly that will happen. We certainly feel good about Permian white sand this year. We're working on solutions to try
to be a rail provider in the brown sand market, as well, and we do a fair amount of that today from other Texas
locations. Certainly it will swing away from white sand as a percentage over, I think, kind of quarter-by-quarter as we
move into next year. We don't really have a prediction for what that looks like for us in 2018, but, like I said, our focus
will be on working to support the white sand guys that are continuing to ship and developing alternatives for the brown
sand.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then if I could ask about the volume guidance. You obviously
gave the expectations for flat year-over-year in Q3 and it sort of implies a pretty wide range for the fourth quarter. So,
wondering if you can help us think through that and maybe handicap whether or not you think volumes could be up in
the fourth quarter.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Allison, this is Rob. We haven't given specific volume guidance for the fourth quarter.
So you're right, it could be a range. We're hopeful that the economy will continue to move in the right direction and our
third quarter, as I pointed out in my comments, while we envision that being kind of flattish year-over-year, we do see
it sequentially growing from where we are today, where we finished in the second quarter. So, stay tuned in terms of
how the world plays out in the fourth quarter.

<Q - Jason Seidl>: Thank you, operator. Hey, good morning, everyone. Two quick questions. Rob, I wanted to talk a
little bit about your comments that we're at that proper level for adjusted debt to EBITDA that you look at. How should
we think about your cadence of share repurchases going forward? Is that going to slow a little bit? Or are you expect it
to keep about the same pace?

<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Well, Jason, as you know, we don't have a set number and we don't give specific
guidance. It will continue to be opportunistic, in terms of the pace at which we buy. So, I couldn't begin to give you
exactly what that cadence will look like – markets will drive. But I would just tell you that, in terms of – the focus that
we have in the organization is driving more cash. So, as we look at the metric, while we're close to that targeted
number, as I pointed out, we still have room to go in terms of generating positive cash in the business, and that gives us
the greatest opportunity to continue to move forward.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Okay. And I wanted to jump back on your Ag outlook a little bit. Talk about how exports in the
quarter impacted the arc. So obviously, you don't talk about pricing, but let's just talk about the overall arc from the
mix. And what should we expect sequentially going forward about exports, and how that would look against your arc in
the third and fourth quarter?
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: So, in the quarter, we did have strong grain export shipments, especially with wheat. And,
obviously, that's a longer length of haul almost all the time. We do see more – we did see some pretty low barge prices,
so we did move a fair amount to the river. So, it impacts our arc positively, but maybe not as much as it historically has,
just because of the river move. As you move into the third and fourth quarter, you're going to see quite a bit less export
grain, particularly in the third quarter, because we had a really strong third quarter last year, and we're now going to be
challenged by pretty strong global availability of grain in markets where they have a significant currency advantage.
So, I would say it would be a negative arc impact versus last year in the third quarter. I don't have a citing of that for
you.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Okay so, Beth, all things being equal, as you look to 3Q and 4Q and comp it versus 2Q, likely
going to be down compared to 2Q, based on the mix?
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: The arc? I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't have a prediction of that for you.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Okay.
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: The volume, yes, on the export side.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the time, as always, guys.

Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Hey, thanks. Good morning.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Good morning.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: I want to talk about productivity a little bit, and understand maybe the cadence for the back
half of the year. So you have $150 million to $200 million left to go, and in the first half, you sort of had a stronger
performance in a better volume environment. I guess my question is, as you see sort of volume comps get a bit tougher
there, what is that variability in cadence for the back half of the year, do you think? If 4Q doesn't turn out to be positive
from a volume standpoint, are you more likely to be the lower end of the guidance? I'm just trying to get some
sensitivity around that for the second half.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Hi, Chris, this is Lance. I'll let Rob speak specifically to the guidance, which is $350 million to
$400 million for the year. But in terms of the mechanics of productivity, Cam and team and the rest of the organization
are constantly working the projects that we have in front of us right now.
So, Rob pointed out three big segments. In the transportation side, it's about train length and being more productive in
switching and locals. It can be more productive in our engineering and mechanical workforces, where we've got
projects underway. And candidly, we've been very straightforward in saying, I think we've got more opportunity to be
more productive in our general administrative and support functions. So, you'll see us take action on all of those in the

second half of the year.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: If I can, I would just add, Chris, that, as you've heard us comment many times before,
we're not going to stop at the $350 million range, and we try not to use volume as an excuse. Certainly, volume is our
friend, and it gives us more optionality in terms of the productivity initiatives, but as we have done for many, many
years, and that is that we have a mindset that we're still going to aggressively go after the productivity initiatives that
Lance outlined that are in front of us that we're aggressively pursuing, and – in spite of what the year-over-year volume
is. And again, we still predict, by the way, our guidance is that volume for the full year is going to be up in the low
single-digits. So, the fact that it's say flattish in the third quarter year-over-year, I don't think that's going to impact or
slow down any of our productivity initiatives.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. All right. That's helpful, I appreciate that. And then, Beth, maybe a question on the
Coal side. So you've given some helpful color around the third quarter, I guess I just wanted to make sure I understood
how you think about sort of finishing out the year relative to what we've been hearing a little bit from the producer side
within PRB coal, and if there is the ability to sort of make commitments, to the extent that there's demand there in the
fourth quarter, depending on what weather does and stockpiles do. I guess our sense is that production levels on the
mine level might end up falling sort of short of flattish in the fourth quarter. I just want to get your sort of thoughts
around that, if you have any.
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: Well, at this point, we haven't considered that we would have significant production
shortages in the fourth quarter, and we're definitely still thinking it looks flattish. I suppose it all depends on what plays
out with third quarter demand in hot weather, and if the producers are in a place where it makes economical sense for
them, I would guess that they'll keep producing into that.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Good morning. I wanted to ask you a little more on the Coal and Intermodal competitive
pressures that you highlighted. I think – I want to say it was maybe third quarter last year that you first started talking
about these pressures, and we have seen better coal volumes, certainly over the last couple quarters in Coal. What do
you think is the dynamic where you might see some of those competitive pressures ease? Is that really a function where
the natural gas price is? Is it just a – market price is lower for coal transport than what your book is priced at, so it's
really a multi-year headwind and repricing to market? Or how would we think about kind of the drivers of that
competitive pressure, and how long the duration might be?
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: You know, it's pretty hard to make any sort of prediction about things that are happening
in a competitive market when the person you're talking about isn't yourself. So I don't probably have any guidance to
give you there. Our focus is just going to be on making sure that we're getting a reinvestable price that makes sense to
us as we renew deals and go out to bid for new books of business.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Tom, this is Lance. Of course, any time the environment improves, from the standpoint of more
economic opportunity for all the competition in marketplace, more volume opportunities, any time that's the case, that's
a better environment to compete in. So, we're looking forward to that being the case at some point in the future.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: What about the Intermodal side? I know you had referred in the past about the kind of
turmoil with the steamships and the consolidation and, obviously, with Hanjin and so forth, do you think that the – as –
I guess there's more activity going on, do you have any visibility to that stabilizing and maybe pricing in international
Intermodal stabilizing, or is that something that probably continues for a while?

<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: You know, I think that the steamship lines are still shaking things outs. And while I think
their economics are better, I don't think they're in a situation where they're making a lot of money, and maybe not even
making money. So, in that environment, I think the pressure remains for them to try to be very economically
competitive in what they do. So, we'll see. I think that may take a little bit longer to shake out.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: And recall, Tom, that those are – that's a moving part from the standpoint of sometimes those
consolidations or partnerships benefit us and sometimes they don't. Regardless, we take that competitive landscape and
compete for the business that makes sense to us from an economic return and compete aggressively for it.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Right. Right. Okay. And then just a quick follow-on. On the Chemicals side, what's the
timing when you really see the impact from the new plants? Are you already seeing that? Or is there kind of a
timeframe when it would be a bigger volume impact from the new production coming on in the Gulf?
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: Yeah, so, it's going to be kind of a slow start, I think. You start to see, I think, one or two
plants really making meaningful production in 2017, and that's really pretty late in the year, and with 2018 being a
more significant impact.

Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Amit Mehrotra>: Hey, thanks, everybody. Thanks for getting me in here. I wanted to ask you on the outlook for
the back half. You do typically see a nice step down in OR sequentially, but, obviously, there's some difficult
comparisons, that you mentioned, possible mix challenges, as well. Can you talk about the puts and takes there and
maybe your confidence or the company's ability to actually lower OR sequentially against that backdrop? Thanks.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, Amit, this is Rob. We aren't going to give specific quarterly OR guidance. You're
right, traditionally, that's the way it plays out. There's a lot of moving parts. We'll see what mix does. It's been favorable
thus far this year. We're going to continue to drive pricing, as Beth has talked about. We're going to continue to be
aggressive on our productivity initiatives, as we've all talked about. And those were the levers. And volume, we think,
is going to be our friend. It's certainly in the third quarter improving from the second quarter, and we'll just have to see
how the numbers play out. But, again, we're confident and pleased with the progress we've made thus far this year and
confident in our ability to improve the operating ratio year-over-year.
<Q - Amit Mehrotra>: Okay. Maybe if I could have a follow-up and just be a little bit more specific as it relates to
maybe the Automotive business and also the Chemical business as it relates to the auto production. I mean, North
American light vehicle production expected to be down about 6% in the third quarter. I think some of that obviously
has to do with the big three changeovers that maybe you are not as exposed to versus the Eastern rails. And then if I'm
not mistaken, there are significant amount of chemical carloads that are also tied to auto production, so, if you can just
help us think about both the Auto and Chemical franchise in light of maybe the sharp drop-off in production and maybe
the impact of mix there. Thanks.
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: So, we have seen strength in Plastics this year. On the PVC and PE side, which – and PP
is really the stuff that goes into auto, so I would agree with you that there's been a little bit of an impact there. It hasn't
been a very significant falloff in PP, but the strength is really coming on the PVC and the PE side, and I don't think that
would be something that we would probably be in a situation where we're calling out later in the year.
On the straight auto side, it does feel like there's weakness there and that that will continue throughout the rest of the
year, and we'll just have to see if the consumer goes back and starts buying cars or not.

in-bound truck for auto parts to auto manufacturing. There's still plenty of opportunity to convert that to an Intermodal

Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for getting us on the call here. Lance, I wonder if
you could just give your investors a little bit of confidence here, because we've been hearing a lot about Precision
Railroading and how that can drive significant improvement at one of your peers. But, you guys have had some pretty
significant OR targets out there for some time now, so, can you tell us just what are the drivers to achieve the 60% OR
and then even beyond the 55%? And how confident are you today versus maybe a couple of years ago?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Let's start with my confidence level, which is, it's never been higher. It's really wonderful to be
speaking to your question, coming off the quarter that we've just had where we've demonstrated on what I would
consider relatively modest volumes, an ability to generate significant operating ratio improvement and productivity. So,
let's talk about how we're generating that productivity.
Getting just a little bit deeper on those three areas that Rob and Cam talked about. When you're thinking about the train
network, what we've been doing to this point is we've been taking our – the way our plan is organized, and
deconstructing it by lane, looking for opportunities to grow train size while maintaining the fundamental aspects of the
plan, with an eye towards making sure that our customer service product is as good as it possibly can be, the best in the
marketplace.
As we look forward, there's an opportunity to commingle some of those service products and we're investigating that as
we speak, thinking through what does that mean from a service product perspective and a productivity perspective? We
think there's pretty good use there. And so, while we've done a great job of growing train size to this point, we think
there's some incremental opportunities we look forward in our train network.
When we think about how we conduct ourselves with our mechanical, our carmen employees, our craft professionals in
the engineering world, and some of the contracting work that we do in both, there's plenty of opportunity and we've got
projects in all of those areas, looking for ways to take out, for instance, leased and rented equipment, contracting work
that just is not a high-value add or can be done more efficiently, and more efficiently finding ways to invest in
equipment that allows us to be way more productive on labor component and have a really attractive return on that
investment.
And then when you think about our ability to generate more productivity on the general and administrative and support
costs side of our world, and inclusive of purchasing material and supplies, we've been making great progress in those
areas, and there's lots of opportunity to come.
And we've got plans and clear-eyed opportunities there that we're developing, and ultimately will be taking advantage
of. So, as we sit here, the team could not be more confident in being able to achieve a 60% plus minus operating ratio
by 2019. And, of course, we're going to do that as quickly as we can. And then immediately thereafter we're just going
to keep it up on our way to a 55% operating ratio, again, as soon as we can.
Another thing that gives us confidence is looking backward at our track record. We've had some fits and starts here
recently, mostly driven by significant volume drops, but even in that context we've had good, solid operating ratio

improvement over a very long period of time and we've demonstrated we know how to do it, and we're going to keep
doing it.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Lance, I appreciate that. How should investors, though, think about the sustainable rate of
improvement on the margin? And you did talk about growth in those comments, as well. I mean, how contingent is this
on growth? Are there still absolute cost buckets that you think you can attack over the next couple of years that would
help drive margins higher and the OR lower?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, so we talk, Brandon, about the three buckets that drive our OR improvement. Pure
productivity, whatever the volume is, and we will continue to get that. Price, which is related to what the value is that
we're bringing to our customers and how we're competing in our markets, and we'll continue to generate that. And
growth. Growth certainly helps. And we're looking for ways, markets, either new ones to penetrate, more business with
existing customers, greater geographic reach, however we can maximize the franchise that we have.
We will be pulling the levers on all three of those areas all the time as we move forward. And it just depends on what
the economy brings to us, what we're able to do as to exactly the role which each lever plays going forward.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Thank you.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Uh-huh.

Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your
questions.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. So, just following up on your – on those three, Lance, and going into
pure productivity. You've got a long-term target and you kind of – of the mid-50s and up at around 62% now. What is
the timeframe? I mean, just ballpark. Is this a two-year, three-year, five-year kind of productivity attack? Is this
something you can front-end load? Are there projects that you're looking on that you're about to pull the trigger on that
can really lead to a revamping of the infrastructure that you have right now that applies to the business you run? Is there
anything that you can give us tangibly that we can kind of look in our models and maybe not out, obviously, to 2019
when you hit 60%, but out within a reasonable timeframe after that to be at that mid-50s? Is there anything you can
point us to?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, I'm not sure I'm going to be very helpful in building out the model for you. I'll tell you,
we're going to get there just as quickly as we can. And as we sit here and look at the different opportunities we have in
front of us, the projects that we've already got launched are the ones that we're defining prior to launch. There's plenty
of opportunity. And some of those might surprise us and deliver out-sized productivity rapidly, and some might be a lot
more pick-and-shovel work that takes a bit more time. I can tell you, we're scanning the environment, regardless of
industry, whether it's other railroad peers or any other competitors or customers of ours to find ideas that we can
implement in our own environment to both accelerate our productivity and to generate productivity.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: And is there anything in that scanning that might lead to a step-function move? Like a
complete overhaul of hump yards and slashing them? Or are your hump yards, in your opinion, fully utilized? Or is
there anything that you think that through scanning might lead to a, not a gradual, but a step-function move in your
infrastructure?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, we're going to learn from everything we see and observe and deconstruct it and see if it
makes sense for our network and our franchise.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Right. Okay.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I'll just remind you that on our network and franchise we have a very robust manifest product.
It requires a fair amount of car switching, and our lowest-cost car switching for us happens to be in our highly-utilized

hump yards. So, at this point, as we look forward, I'm not so sure you're going to see a lot of change in that area.
Plus, you might see change in other areas, like how we define our networks and products, and perhaps the commingling
of some of our service products so that we can both generate a better service product for our customers and more
productivity for our shareholders. You know, bear in mind, we've got four stakeholders and we're serving them all at
the same time. Our customers, our employees, the communities that we serve, and you, our shareholder.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Moving on to this other bucket, which is pricing, now, you've noted that you're kind of
excluding some of the problem areas in Coal and others, you are booking 2% to 3% pricing, which is great. In the
problem areas, these tend to be – you're going to be affected by contracts that have been signed that will probably have
some long tail length to them. Two questions on that. When do those start coming off, the ones that are keeping your
pricing down in those problem areas? And at this point, are you booking new contracts in those problem areas above
that depressed level in prior periods?
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: So, I don't think we are going to give any real guidance on past or future pricing and
specific contracts, but what I would tell you is the competition is as fierce today in Coal and Intermodal as it has been
over the last, I guess we've been talking about this for about a year, so that's kind of where we are.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Good morning.
<Q - Justin Long>: So, you said earlier that Coal volume should be about flat year-over-year in the third quarter. And
that translates into a sequential improvement of about 20% in coal volumes, and that's really all the sequential
improvement you need to get for consolidated volumes to be flat on a year-over-year basis in 3Q. So, I guess saying it
another way, it basically implies that non-coal volumes stay flat sequentially. With that in mind, could you just give
some more color on non-coal volumes sequentially, and what you're expecting to get better and what you're expecting
to get worse in 3Q?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob, you want to take the guidance part of that, please?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. Justin, I would just say, you may be taking too fine a slide rule to the – what we
talked about. Coal, we're giving sort of a directional comment on our overall volumes and on Coal. I wouldn't take that
as literally as you have, because the factors that will drive coal demand will continue to be gas prices, weather,
economy, all those factors that could change exactly what the cadence is in the third quarter. So, our guidance, again, to
Lance's point, our guidance all in is kind of flattish. It could be either side of that. We'll see. We want it to be as high as
possible, but it's flattish year-over-year but sequential improvement from here.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: And Beth, you want to just maybe talk a little bit about other markets and what's going on?
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: Yeah, so, there'll be ins and outs in all the markets. There always are. I'd just remind you,
Ag was pretty strong last year, and so the third quarter is a tough comp for that. And all the other markets are going to
continue to evolve as we move through the quarter. But, as Rob said, we expect to be flattish.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe secondly, Kansas City Southern has talked a lot about the
refined product opportunity in Mexico, and it sounds like those shipments have picked up in the second quarter for their
business. Do you see this as an opportunity for your network at all, or just from a geographic standpoint, is this not
really a needle mover?

<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: It's a small and emerging market for us right now. We are doing a reasonable amount of
traffic. I wouldn't call it substantial amount of traffic in finished fuels into Mexico, both in partnership with the KCSM
and with the Ferromex, and we were probably a big mover early into the LPG space, and we are still seeing a lot of
propane moving into Mexico. The finished fuels have been a little slower to take off, because there's not a lot of
terminal infrastructure in Mexico to handle them, but we see it as a reasonable opportunity over the period, until more
infrastructure is built in Mexico.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Hey, Justin, I would remind you, and all of our listeners at this point, we enjoy a robust
franchise to and from Mexico. Because we serve all six major rail gateways, we enjoy about 70% of all rail
cross-border traffic to and from Mexico. So, we will get our fair share.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Great. I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.

The next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yeah, hi. I'd like to ask a question on Intermodal. In your presentation, you mentioned
parcel growth. I don't know that we've seen that called out a lot in the past as a driver for the quarter. Could I ask for
some elaboration on this? Broadly, how material are parcels to your franchise? Is it trending upward rapidly in line with
B2C and online fulfillment? And can you elaborate on maybe challenges or investments you've had to make to serve
this?
<A - Elizabeth F. Whited>: Yeah, so we – we think about our business in domestic and international and then, within
the domestic space, there's kind of truckload and premium, and parcel would fall into that premium segment. And we
have seen some nice growth in it. I think a fair amount of that is being driven by e-commerce, and so that's enabled us
to participate in that. And it's been pretty exciting for us. In terms of investments that we've had to make to support it,
we've been able to utilize, to a pretty significant extent, the facilities that we already had in place for Intermodal
shipments, and we also do support it from time to time with additional train starts, if that investment makes sense for
us. So, that's where we are at this point. It's been a fun market for us to watch emerge.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Great. Thank you, Beth. As a follow-up, my second question, I guess, maybe this is for
Cameron. A lot of times when you see a big volume influx like we've seen last couple quarters in Coal, or this quarter
in Industrial Products, it can compromise margins, yet you've handled it pretty deftly and actually set records in
margins. Is it simply more train starts than you had available locomotives and personnel furloughed? Or maybe you
could elaborate on some of the challenges of bringing that volume on so rapidly.
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: It is always our stated objective to take Beth's volume and layer it on top of our current
train-start network. And, as I mentioned before, there is lots of headroom, in almost every train category that we have,
to continue to do that. The coal marketplace for us and train size is fairly optimized. There are still opportunities, but it
is fairly optimized. So really, in stepping up to the plate with beautiful volume growth from Beth in Coal is making
sure we're matching appropriate manpower, planning, and locomotive planning to handle the volumes as they come
online. And I think we've accomplished that very nicely here in the second quarter.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Probably Industrial is a lot more complex than Coal, any more destinations and origins
than the somewhat repeatable business in the Coal franchise, though, with just simply having ample capacity to add
lengths to trains, Cameron?
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: Yes, it is. And you are correct, that does become very complex very quickly. And our
service-design team and our network planning team has done a very nice job, whether it's a regional opportunity or a

big system network opportunity, to take that growth and layer it right on top of our current program.

Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Jeffrey Kaufman>: Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been answered. So, let me just ask one on
utilization. I think we understand a lot of the factors that impacted the West Coast flow-through in terms of terminal
dwell and average train speed. You briefly mentioned it in your comments today. Can you talk about where you are in
getting that to the levels you want to, and at what point do you think we start to see more positive year-on-year comps
in those two areas?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Cameron?
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: You're absolutely right in the first quarter, with the Western region impact, we took a pretty
substantial hit on both velocity and car dwell. Largely, that velocity in the Western region has returned to us. It's been a
little – taken a little bit longer for us to recover in the Western region than we anticipated, but we feel confident in the
second half, the Western region will start delivering the extra velocity and improved [ph] terminal (1:11:40)
performance that we expect out of them. The Southern region that, as I mentioned, has a bridge outage that will be
resolved here in a week. They also have very heavy renewal capital programming, so it makes it a complicated network
down south. As soon as we get that bridge back in service, we anticipate the Southern region will come right back to
anticipated velocity, as well.
<Q - Jeffrey Kaufman>: One follow-up to that. I could be wrong on my statistics here, but I seem to remember when
the weather gets below a certain temperature, you got to slow trains down because the rails get brittle; when the
weather gets above a certain temperature, you got to slow trains down because the track gets soft. We've had some
pretty extreme weather this quarter, particularly in the south and southwest. Is any of that impacting the system and can
you discuss whether I'm off target on that?
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: No, you are correct. Heat orders are applied when we reach certain temperature thresholds.
And it has been a nice warm summer. About the only area of our business where that becomes impactful is when you're
looking at high premium Intermodal product. That does tend to retard the maximum train speed that you'd like to run,
when it comes to that high premium Intermodal product. The rest of the network is largely unaffected by those
heat-slow orders.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Hey, Jeff, the other aspect of heat is – you know, we're an outdoor business.
<Q - Jeffrey Kaufman>: Right.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So, we've really got to help our craft professionals kind of watch their health when it gets to
temperatures like we're in right now. And that can slow down work to some degree because they've got to make sure
they take breaks. They've got to get out of the heat and be able to keep their body temperature reasonable. And you can
just imagine working eight or ten or twelve hours in the kind of environment we have now. That can have an impact on
an individual's productivity.
<Q - Jeffrey Kaufman>: Okay. Well, thank you for your answers and good luck.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Thank you.

The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International. Please go ahead with your
questions.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: Yeah, thanks for fitting me in here this morning. The operating cash flow was down about
2% year-to-date on mid-teens growth and net income. Can you just walk us through if anything there is timing related?
And kind of how you expect that to shake out relative to net income for the full-year? And then maybe a similar
comment longer term. Do we expect to grow cash flow in line, maybe a little better than, a little worse than net income
over time? Thanks.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, Bascome, there was a timing issue when you look year-over-year. You're right,
the reported numbers show it down. There was, call it $400 million year-over-year delta on the bonus depreciation.
And that is kind of front-end loaded for this year, so we'll see how it kind of plays out for the balance of the year. But,
longer term, our goal is to continue to drive that number positively, clearly. And we have every expectation that, given
all of the productivity initiatives we have underway, that that will be at a very strong pace.
