John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining the call and again thanks for your interest in Wells
Fargo. I am very pleased with our record results for the year and the fourth quarter, which again demonstrate the power
and momentum of our franchise. We continue to focus on meeting the financial needs of our customers and as a result
we grew revenue, loans, deposits, and cross-sell as well as increased market share across our businesses. We also
experienced significant improvement in credit quality in the quarter, continuing the steady improvement we
experienced throughout 2010.
The Wachovia merger continues to exceed all of our expectations and we are particularly pleased with the positive
customer response we have received as we begin integrating the Wachovia stores in our Eastern states. In fact, for the
second consecutive year, Wells Fargo ranked number one among large banks in the American Customer Satisfaction
Index.
Our internal metrics indicate greater customer retention and deepening customer relationships even as we completed
increasingly complex merger activities. For example, we have already replaced more than 5,000 Wachovia ATMs, with
all of our over 12,000 ATMs now on one operating platform. Simply by offering our customers in the East the same
web-enabled, envelope-free ATMs we have in the West, ATM deposit transactions in our Eastern markets increased
55%. This is just one example of how we continue to execute our business model while serving our customers when,
where, and how they want to be served.
Deposit growth remained strong throughout our company with net checking account growth of 7.5%, including
California up 8.2% and Florida up 10%. Since the merger, we have grown core deposits by $53 billion while favorably
changing the composition from higher cost CDs to lower cost checking and savings accounts. In fact, listen to this, at
the time of the merger, 23% of our core deposits were in CDs, compared with less than 10% today.
Just this past weekend, we successfully completed the systems integration of our retail brokerage business. As a
consequence, we now have over 15,000 financial advisors, in all 50 states, on one common platform, state-of-the-art,
and very robust trading, planning and investment platform activities and capabilities. This further enables cross-sell
across banking, wealth management, and brokerage customers nationwide. Even as we celebrate the outstanding
success of the Wachovia merger to date, we continue to focus intently on the remaining work ahead, converting the rest
of the East Coast Wachovia banking stores to Wells Fargo throughout 2011.
Turning to the issue of regulatory reform, we have always been supportive of changes designed to better protect and
serve consumers, businesses and the financial system. In some cases, however, such as the currently proposed control
of debit interchange fees, suggested changes may have unintended consequences for the U.S. consumer, which causes
our industry some concern. We believe that lawmakers should engage all constituents, merchants, consumers and banks
and take the necessary time to reach a reasonable and equitable solution. In that way, we can all help make our
regulatory and operating framework a positive one for customers, the banking industry, and the overall health of the
U.S. economy.
As a company with more than 280,000 team members, our focus in this period of a new normal will be as always, on
how we best serve our customers by providing more value. So we are focusing on reducing expenses, being more
efficient and nimble and increasing revenue by winning more customers and deepening existing relationships, and
thereby limiting the impact of regulatory reform costs on our customers. Granted, there will be some costs that will be
passed along to customers. We have begun to implement some changes and there are more to come. But these decisions
will always be made with the customer at the center.
As we work through these changes, we will focus on three things: Providing our customers with choices and education
about their options, rewarding customers for doing more business with us and finally offering meaningful value at fair
prices. With the evolving environment, we are more convinced than ever, that our commitment to helping our
customers succeed financially will create the best long-term value for shareholders.
Now let me turn this over to Howard.

Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the slide presentation included in the quarterly
supplement that's available on the Wells Fargo Investor Relations website. I've got a lot of ground to cover this
morning. As shown on slide – the slide labeled Fourth Quarter Overview, I'd like to organize my remarks around five
key areas:
First, our earnings were once again very strong, a record $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Perhaps more important was
the high quality of our results with broad-based revenue growth across a large number of our 80 plus businesses and
acceleration of checking and savings account deposit growth and now loan growth, in total and in loan portfolios other
than the non-strategic portfolio which we've been running off.
Second, we had a significant improvement in credit quality in the quarter, with non-performing loans and
non-performing assets now down this quarter and net charge-offs down once again, after having peaked over a year
ago.
In terms of mortgage securitization, we continued to experience declining repurchase demands, outstanding demands in
total are only about $2.1 billion right now and we consider the $1.3 billion reserve as of 12/31/2010 to be adequate
given what we are seeing from investors.
On reg reform, I'll spend some time discussing the actual Q4 impacts as well as our evolving cost estimates and how
we are thinking about the issues here.
And on capital, we had a 12% annualized internal capital generation in the fourth quarter. Capital ratios are higher than
they've ever been. In terms of Basel III Tier 1 common we had approximately a 7% ratio and our objective of course is
to build Tier 1 common while at the same time, returning capital to shareholders at a more normal level.
On slide three, you can see our earnings have been very strong every quarter since the merger with Wachovia. We
earned a total of $24.6 billion over the past eight quarters, including the record $3.4 billion earned in the fourth quarter
which represents a 15% return on tangible common.
Earnings increased 9% linked quarter annualized and 21% year-over-year, producing a $0.61 earnings per share in the
fourth quarter. As a reminder, a year ago, our EPS was $0.08 a share but that reflected the $0.47 reduction for the
TARP preferred stock dividend, including the redemption of TARP in the fourth quarter of 2009. Apart from TARP,
our EPS was up 11% year-over-year on a 10% larger base of diluted average shares outstanding.
Now there were a number of items in the fourth quarter that affected revenue and earnings and demonstrate the quality
of our results. As you can see on slide four, I'd like to go over some of these in some detail, first, the full quarter
revenue impact from Reg E was $431 million pre-tax in the quarter, up $51 million from the third quarter. And if you
remember, the changes here started in the middle of the third quarter. As more customers opt-in and we make product
changes, we expect this revenue impact to diminish progressively over the next two years and I'll have more to say
about that in a moment.
We continued to earn income on our PCI commercial loans that were sold at gains or otherwise favorably resolved. We
had $99 million of PCI loan resolution income in the quarter, down $103 million from the third quarter. Given the fact
that we marked the Wachovia loan portfolio at the widest credit spreads in the cycle, and given the success we've had
in resolving problem loans, loan resolution income has actually averaged about $186 million in the eight quarters since
the merger. And we see some additional potential for additional resolution income as the economy and markets
improve, but of course, with fewer loans to work out and hard to predict exactly when that may occur.
We had equity gains of $317 million in the quarter compared with $131 million in the third quarter. Now this is a more
regular source of earnings for our company. We've averaged about $195 million of gains in the past four quarters,
largely from the private equity portfolio and given the relatively buoyant stock market, there's some potential for
additional gains going forward here.

We had $268 million of bond losses, almost all due to the sale of our lowest-yielding securities, which we repositioned
at higher rates prevailing at quarter-end and early first quarter. This offset almost all of the equity gains in the quarter.
Merger integration expenses totaled $534 million, up $58 million from the third quarter. If you remember, we said that
the fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011 would be the peak quarters, roughly, in terms of the integration.
These expenses, of course, will go away after we finish the integration in late 2011 and early 2012.
In the quarter, we made a $400 million charitable contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. We typically contribute
about 1% of annual earnings each year to the Foundation, so the fourth quarter contribution covers three full years of
estimated funding and estimated expenses for the Foundation.
We typically have higher expenses in the last quarter of each year. If you look at the advertising, travel and equipment
expenses in the quarter, which is where most of the seasonality occurs, Q4 was higher than Q3 by over $300 million.
Foreclosed asset expense was $452 million, up $86 million from the third quarter. These costs will remain elevated in
the near-term before declining as problem assets decline.
Next, reflecting the improvement in credit quality, we had an $850 million reserve release in the quarter, and we expect
additional releases in the future, absent significant deterioration in the economy. I'll discuss in a moment some
additional items in our mortgage business, including an increase in repurchase reserves, higher foreclosure costs and
volume-related expenses in that business.
Now while I like to say our earnings are our earnings, I've noted these particular items on this slide, which includes
more unders than overs, simply to underscore the very high quality of our earnings in the fourth quarter.
Slide five, our earnings growth in the fourth quarter was driven by two main factors, one of which was the very strong
revenue that we had in the quarter. In the next few slides, I'll highlight for you just how strong and just how
broad-based our revenue was across products, across segments, across geography and across customers. Given the fact
that we operate and cross-sell across 80-some-odd different businesses, our quarterly revenue has been relatively
diverse in most quarters but in this quarter, particularly so. Two-thirds of our businesses generated revenue growth in
the quarter, in the aggregate producing 12% linked quarter annualized revenue growth.
Over 60% of the company's $21.5 billion in fourth quarter revenue came from businesses that produced double-digit
revenue growth. This revenue growth was broad-based across all product lines. We began seeing signs of some loan
demand two quarters ago, and in the fourth quarter, that translated into an increase in loan outstandings, which were up
2% in total, and up 6% linked quarter annualized in portfolios other than the non-strategic loans we are running off.
We've had strong core deposit growth now for many quarters, and in the fourth quarter, checking and savings account
growth accelerated to 17% annualized from the prior quarter. As John mentioned, about 90% of our core deposits are
now in the form of checking and savings, reflecting the success we've had in gaining, retaining and building household
and business relationships.
Mortgage originations were up 27%. We had a continued increase in client assets in Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement,
which were up 12% annualized. Trust and investment fees, which included brokerage and investment banking fees rose
15%. So you can see across many, many product lines, very strong growth.
On slide six, each of our business segments had a solid quarter. Community Banking earned $2 billion in profits on
$13.5 billion in revenue. Core product sales in this business reached 7.1 million sales in the West, up 17% from a year
ago, and grew at double-digits in the East year-over-year. Sales were strong in both consumer and small business and
across geographies. We saw linked quarter loan growth in auto, private student lending and SBA lending, and as shown
on slide six, many diverse businesses within the Community Bank had linked quarter double-digit revenue growth.
Now global remittance, an interesting one, is an interesting example of the traction we are getting in our revenue
growth from the combination with Wachovia. Remittance transaction volume increased 41% to $1.42 billion in 2010.
The global remittance business is benefiting from revenue synergies with Wachovia, with over 30% of the increase in
dollar volume in the fourth quarter coming from Wachovia stores that have converted to Wells Fargo. Now this was a
product that was not offered at Wachovia stores prior to the merger.

Our Wholesale Banking group earned $1.6 billion on $5.8 billion in revenue. This business had linked quarter loan
growth for the first time since the merger, including loan growth in commercial banking, commercial real estate,
asset-backed finance, capital finance, government banking, equipment finance and international.
Wholesale Banking has grown revenue consistently for many quarters, in fact, many years, as it has gained more
customers and cross-sold deposits – I'm sorry, cross-sold deeper into its relationships. This revenue growth in the
quarter also reflects merger synergies, for example, in investment banking revenue, coming from our commercial
customers, that was up 44% in large part as more of our current relationships use Wells Fargo Securities to underwrite
their bond and equity financings.
Our Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement business had solid linked quarter revenue growth, up 18%, as client assets grew
to $1.3 trillion, up 12% linked quarter annualized. Client demand for managed account relationships continued to be
strong as managed account assets grew 30% annualized from the third quarter. Brokerage lines of credit increased 18%
annualized. We now have more than 15,000 financial advisors who are increasingly focused on meeting our customers'
total financial needs and who originated loans up 50% in this group in 2010. This business is an increasingly important
growth business for us and an increasingly important source of cross-sell.
On slide seven, as you can see, the main reason our revenue has been so strong and so consistent is that our business
model leads to greater market share and greater share of wallet. In the fourth quarter, retail cross-sell for all households
combined was 5.7, up from 5.47 a year-ago. Cross-sell was up about 4% in the West, and up even more in the East as
Wachovia stores adopt the Wells Fargo sales model. We still have what we think is roughly a 20% revenue growth
opportunity in the East, simply by increasing cross-sell in the East, up to the West cross-sell of 6.14.
Importantly, on slide seven we show market share data, starting with the first quarter after the merger through the last
available quarter. And there are two things I'd point out about the market share data. First, you can see just how much
market share we've gained after having put the two companies together at the end of 2008. And second, you can see
just how broad-based our market share growth has been in virtually every type of financial services that households or
businesses need and want.
Before turning to credit quality, I would like to make a few points about the mortgage business on slide eight. Mortgage
banking non-interest income, increased $258 million in the fourth quarter, not coincidentally, we also had
approximately $200 million of higher operating expenses in the quarter to process all these originations. An example of
our ability to modify capacity and variable expenses up and down as volume ebbs and flows.
On slide eight for purposes of analysis, we've broken down mortgage fees into component parts, originations and
servicing. On the origination side, the total gain on origination activities was $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, but that
included $464 million provided for repurchase reserves, up $94 million from the third quarter. This addition primarily
reflected an increase in loss severity projections, even though unresolved repurchase demands are down again in the
quarter. The $2.9 billion gain from origination activities was up 27% from the third quarter on a 27% increase in
originations.
All in, servicing revenue was $240 million in the quarter. I'm often asked where in the income statement we account for
higher residential foreclosure costs and in fact, the present value of projected residential mortgage foreclosure costs is
reflected in the MSR valuation. So when foreclosure expenses are projected to rise, the full higher expected costs
reduce current period earnings through a reduction in the MSR.
As you can see on this slide, we reduced the value of our MSR by $143 million in the fourth quarter, for higher
projected servicing and foreclosure costs. We review and adjust our servicing and foreclosure cost projections within
our MSR valuation each quarter and have been adding to this cost for several quarters now to reflect the current higher
cost environment.
The ratio of MSRs as a percent of loans serviced for others was 86 basis points up slightly from 72 basis points in the
third quarter, simply due to the higher mortgage rates in the quarter. But we expect we will once again be at the lower
end of the peers on this metric

Let me now shift to credit quality, starting on slide nine. In addition to building the franchise, the second key reason our
earnings were so strong in the quarter was because credit quality improved significantly. Charge-offs declined again as
they have in every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2009 and are now 29% below the peak.
We've indicated in the past that given our particular loan portfolio mix, the peak of non-performers would lag the peak
in charge-offs. Non-performing loans appear now to have peaked and were down $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter with
new inflows dropping significantly and outflows accelerating.
Provision expense was $2.99 billion, down $456 million, including an $850 million reserve release and reflecting the
$256 million quarterly reduction in losses. Absent a significant deterioration in the economy, we expect future
reductions in the allowance for loan losses.
Our allowance for credit losses stands at $23.5 billion at year-end, that's 6.1 times quarterly charge-offs. In addition, the
PCI non-accretable difference of $13.4 billion represents about 29.5% of the remaining PCI unpaid principal balance.
On slide 10, not only were charge-offs down in the quarter, but virtually all of our leading credit metrics point to
continued improvement. As I mentioned, non-performing assets were down linked quarter for the first time since the
merger with Wachovia, down 6%. Non-performing loans declined $2.1 billion from the third quarter with reductions in
C&I, commercial real estate construction, and each of the consumer loan categories.
Total non-performing inflows were down 13% and outflows increased 21%. Criticized classified assets were down
roughly 10%, apart from some definitional changes, the biggest decline we've had so far in this cycle.
We also continue to see a reduction in loans 90 plus days past due and still accruing, which have declined now for four
consecutive quarters. Commercial loans 90 days or more past due, improved significantly from the third quarter, down
40%. And finally, early stage delinquencies declined from the third quarter. Quite a positive development actually since
fourth quarter is usually a seasonally higher quarter for delinquencies as you can see from the fourth quarter of 2009.
On slide 11, this improvement in credit quality in large part reflects the success we've had over the last two years and
into the fourth quarter reducing higher risk asset portfolios. On this slide, we show the decrease in our higher risk,
non-strategic portfolios since the merger with Wachovia, which are now down a total of almost $55 billion or 32% over
the past two years. This portfolio has been reduced significantly in the aggregate and in each type of portfolio we have
decided to exit.
Now while these portfolios do have an interest yield, they are break even at best, after considering charge-off rates and
workout and loan resolution costs and of course, these loans also tie up a lot of capital. So this portfolio will continue to
decline.
The PCI portfolio continued to perform better than expected. Over the past two years, we've had only – have only had
to add about $1.6 billion to the reserves related to PCI loans in the commercial portfolio. Due to improved expected
cash flows in the PCI portfolio, largely the Pick-a-Pay portion of that portfolio and also due to commercial loans that
have already been resolved, we've released a total of $5.3 billion of non-accretable difference with $1.5 billion
recognized in earnings since the merger from loan resolutions and $3.7 billion recognized through accretable yield over
the life of the loans. Again, this was not a big factor in the fourth quarter results.
While the non-accretable balance has absorbed $22 billion of losses related to PCI loans, we have $13.4 billion of
non-accretable difference remaining, covering as I said before, 29.5% of the remaining unpaid principal balance.
Actual quarterly losses have been declining and were $836 million in the fourth quarter on the PCI portfolio, compared
to a $2.8 billion eight-quarter average. In other words, actual quarterly losses in the PCI portfolio are down
significantly which is what you'd expect after working these assets for two years now.
On slide 12, talk about mortgage securitization, last quarter we gave you a lot of detail regarding the quality of our
servicing portfolio and our repurchase reserves, let me provide just a few updates for you this quarter. As you can see
on this slide, our residential servicing portfolio is predominantly comprised of agency paper, nearly half of the loans in
the servicing portfolio were originated through our retail channels and less than 2% was subprime at origination. The

majority of originated or acquired non-traditional product such as Pick-a-Pay, Wells Fargo debt consolidation and
home equity is on our balance sheet and therefore, losses on these loans have been handled through loan loss reserves
and PCI non-accretable and therefore have no repurchase risk
Quality of our servicing portfolio is reflected in our low delinquency and foreclosure rate. As of the end of the third
quarter, the most recently available quarter publically, we continue to have the lowest delinquency and foreclosure rate
among large-bank peers. Our delinquency and foreclosure rate continued to decline in the fourth quarter and was down
at around 8%, which is counter to typical higher fourth quarter seasonality. In fact, we have not seen the delinquency
rate improve during the fourth quarter in at least the last 10 years. It's also down significantly from a peak of 8.96% a
year-ago.
Our outstanding agency repurchase demands continued to decrease in the fourth quarter with both the number and the
dollar volume of demands outstanding down nearly 50% from the second quarter peak. Total outstanding agency
demands are down to $1.5 billion and the most problematic vintages, in terms of losses, continue to be 2006 through
2008. We saw new demands in those vintages drop for the third consecutive quarter in Q4.
New non-agency repurchase demands based on loan count have declined now for three consecutive quarters with only
$137 million of repurchases in the fourth quarter. The repurchase demand levels reflect the quality of our non-agency
portfolio. In terms of private securitizations in the non-agency portfolio, 70% are Jumbo loans, 81% were prime loans
at origination, 58% were originated prior 2006. We have an insignificant amount of home equity in this portfolio, and
approximately 50% of our private securitizations do not have traditional reps and warranties and therefore by definition
are not subject to repurchase risk.
Now the segment of the private securitizations, where we might have the possibility of higher risk, which would be the
combination of subprime, 2006, 2007 vintages with reps and warranties and with current LTVs close to 100%. That
combination represents only 6% of the total private securitizations, in other words less than 0.5% of total
securitizations.
Let me now touch on regulatory reform on slide 13 and talk a little bit about Q4 impacts and how we are thinking about
the issue more generally. First on Reg E, if you remember Reg E went into effect in the middle of the third quarter. So
Q4 was the first full quarter impact. We calculated about a $270 million after-tax impact in the fourth quarter, that's
very consistent with our prior guidance on this subject. We expect 2011 quarterly averages, impacts to decline over
time, perhaps into the $215 million to $240 million after-tax range as we benefit from higher opt-in rates and product
changes.
Now I should mention, we are being very measured in our approach here, first because we want to make sure that our
customers understand all their options and can make an informed choice and second, because our first priority in the
East at least, is to complete the integration.
On the Credit Card Act, if you remember that also went into effect the third quarter of last year, where we had a $30
million impact and a $50 million impact in the fourth quarter. That of course, is now already in our run rate. We have a
much-smaller impact from this Act for us than for all of our large peers, who have much larger credit card businesses
On FDIC, we expect the FDIC quarterly expenses to increase by about $40 million after tax, starting in the second
quarter of 2011. Since approximately 80% of our total funding is from core customer deposits, a real competitive
advantage for us. The FDIC changes will have a much smaller impact on Wells Fargo than on those companies who are
more wholesale or more market-funded.
Now on debit and interchange fees, as John mentioned, this topic is still being debated and we would suggest there's a
wide range of potential outcomes, including, obviously, no impact if this regulation is not implemented.
Based on the facts as we know currently, a place marker for this would be around $250 million plus or minus per
quarter initially, but I want to emphasize, this is just an approximation and is very, very, very preliminary. We believe
there's still a lot of work to be done on this, so we will have to see where this goes, when it goes, and indeed, if it goes
into effect.

Regulatory reform and its impact on the banks and its customers is still a work in progress. Through its direct impact on
checking, debit and credit cards, reg reform will clearly place additional costs on the nation's payment system. Some of
which will need to be borne in the form of higher fees by the consumers and businesses who benefit from the
significant ongoing investment the banking industry makes in maintaining a viable payment system. We believe this is
about revenue though, not simply about fees, and gaining more business and more customers by having the right value
proposition across all payment products will be one important part of our response.
The second part of our response to reg reform will also be to step up our efforts to be cost-competitive in the
marketplace. So on slide 14; let me describe some of the things you can expect on expenses. As I mentioned earlier, we
had $533 million of Wachovia merger integration expenses in the fourth quarter. This expense will decline as the
integration activities start to wind down in 2011 and there could be some small tail into the first quarter of 2012.
While credit quality continued to improve, we still have higher than normal costs associated with loan resolutions and
loss mitigation including both personnel and foreclosed asset expenses. We expect these expenses will decline
moderately in 2011 and then perhaps more significantly. And we provided here again, some range of potential expense
levels for loan resolution and loss mitigation costs in both 2011 and 2012, compared with the $827 million of actual
expense in the fourth quarter of 2010.
In the third quarter of 2010 we closed the separate branch network for Wells Fargo Financial. By the way, a very good
example of the economies of scale we can achieve with Wachovia. And we expect additional cost saves as the Wells
Fargo Financial portfolio is reduced over time.
As mentioned earlier, we had a $400 million charitable contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation in the fourth quarter
covering three years of estimated expenses and funding for the Foundation and our current view is that, that will of
course go to zero in the next two years as a result.
As I mentioned, advertising, travel and equipment expenses in the fourth quarter were seasonally higher than average,
than the average quarterly run rate, so that will be somewhat lower, all other things constant in 2011 and 2012 than the
fourth quarter number that you see.
And finally, as we've mentioned before, we are working on a company-wide expense initiative that's focused on
process improvements, improving time to market, reducing complexity in our product lines, and eliminating
redundancies and we'll provide much more comprehensive details on this by the middle of this year.
Finally, on slide 15, our capital ratios continue to increase in the fourth quarter driven by strong internal capital
generation of $3.5 billion, up 12% annualized. Tier 1 common grew to 8.37%, up 36 basis points from the third quarter.
That ratio is well above our average of 7% Tier 1 common from 2001 to 2007. Under the Basel capital proposals we
estimate our Tier 1 common capital ratio at 6.9% in the fourth quarter.
Now as we wait to hear from our regulators on our capital plan submission we remain eager to increase our dividend
and hope to eventually, and I emphasize eventually, return to a more normalized pay-out ratio of at least 30% and to
engage in repurchasing shares in step with continued capital growth. We also expect to redeem those trust-preferred
securities that are callable and that would no longer be considered Tier 1 capital under new regulations. While of course
all of this is subject to regulatory approval, I would highlight that our capital is very strong. It's been growing steadily
through industry leading internal capital generation, credit quality has clearly improved and we have shed significant
asset risk now from our balance sheet.
So in summary, our fourth quarter continued to demonstrate the company's ability to earn strong and consistent
earnings. Our results in the fourth quarter, in our view were high quality, driven by broad-based revenue growth and
significant improvement in credit quality and our capital position is strong and continuing to grow.
With that, I'd like to now open up the call for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. Howard, a question on just liquidity. If we look at your cash, your fed
funds sold position, it's grown dramatically in the last year, looks about $72 billion average in the fourth quarter. Just
wondering why is it you seem to be sitting on so much cash and liquidity and what would be the criteria for you to start
putting some of that to work?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, John, we do have a
lot of liquidity, and that's really the result of having such strong deposit growth. As I mentioned earlier, 7%, checking
account, savings account growth, just in the fourth quarter, and as you know, our deposit growth has surpassed our loan
growth in the last period of time. Obviously we'd love to see more loan demand. We're beginning to see of that now.
And we think that the cash that we have on the balance sheet positions us very well for when loan growth does
materialize. And of course, should interest rates go up enough, we can consider adding more to the bond portfolio,
which we've been reluctant to do in a significant way so far just given what we think may be the very low level of
long-term interest rates that have been prevailing.
<Q - John McDonald>: So you view this as offense, this isn't really defensive getting ready for new liquidity
requirements or anything like that?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No this is not about being -
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Total offense, John.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: – required to hold more
liquidity. This is simply we've been incredibly successful in growing deposits and as you know, we've always tried to
do the right thing for our balance sheet and earnings. So this is just very offensive and positioning for the future.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay. Second question on expenses, on the page 14 slide, first, why do the Wells Fargo
Financial wind down costs last for three years?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's not the wind down cost.
It's the ongoing cost of keeping the portfolio going. There is a loan portfolio there, the debt consolidation portfolio.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And as that portfolio
matures over time, we'll be able to pull the costs down and further integrate into the existing retail system.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: But John, the store costs are all out.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay. Got it. And then on that slide, it seems from looking at that, that you could have some
meaningful expense leverage in 2012. And the question I hear a lot, and I'm sure you get is will you let any of this fall
to the bottom line? Or is there a long list of investment projects that this is going to get re-directed to? And feel free to
answer that it'll be some of both.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, first of all, we are not under
investing today. We think of this company as a growth company, we invest in growth opportunities. We opened stores
this last year. We've added tons of bankers, more feet on the street. So as we get to 2012, if we see some great
investment opportunities that are incrementally above where we are today, we'll do that, otherwise, this will flow to the
bottom line, but...
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We are not under-investing today and
this is not to redirect someplace because we have to make an investment someplace.

<Q - John McDonald>: Right, right. Okay. That's very clear. Thank you. Last thing on mortgage, I know you don't
give out the number, but directionally, did the origination gain on sale margins come down materially in the fourth
quarter? And can you give some just directional magnitude on that? And do you expect further contraction again in
early 2011?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: In terms of the spread on
gain on sale is what you're talking about?
<Q - John McDonald>: Yes.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: There wasn't a material
change in the quarter.
<Q - John McDonald>: Was not?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No.
<Q - John McDonald>: So volume really drove the change in -
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: As I said, we had – you
take – put aside the repurchase reserve provision, the origination fee, non-interest income what was up roughly the
same as the origination volume.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay. And could you comment at all on what your thoughts are going into this year on those
margins holding up?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: The industry is
consolidated, so on average margins are not going to change very much, but what will drive margins up and down is
the level of interest rates and volume and the industry's adding and subtracting capacity. So it really is going to be a
function of demand overall.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David Ho>: Hi. Good morning, this is David Ho on behalf of Matt. Question on your Tier 1 common, it rose by
36 basis points in fourth quarter under Basel I. Curious to see why you didn't see an increase under Basel III?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Because of again some
evolving definitional changes, number one. And number two, because we had some real growth in risk-weighted assets.

<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: A couple of questions. One is on capital management. And, Howard, you mentioned that you've
got the dividend, share buybacks, reinvestment. Could you just prioritize how you're thinking about that? Does the 30%

payout come first and then everything else follows after that?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think the point I'd try to
make, Betsy, is that there are really three things that we're focused on right now. We want to start getting the dividend
back up to a more normal payout ratio. We think that's important, appropriate and time to reward our shareholders in
that fashion.
Number two, share repurchase simultaneously is important, and in combination with a higher dividend. And clearly we
want to call the TRUPS, which has an immediate impact on both earnings and Tier 1 common and doesn't cost us
anything from a capital perspective. So all three of those things are important and represent an important part of our
capital management.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Because when you talked about doing the buy backs, you were talking about doing the buy
backs in step with capital growth...
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well here's sort of a
conceptual construct. As you know, a company that's growing capital at twice the rate of its asset growth can return a
lot more than 30% of its capital back to its shareholders and still grow capital. So, when we think about total return of
capital to shareholders, it's really the combination of dividend and share repurchase that we're thinking about and that
number could be more than 30% – just the 30% dividend payout ratio.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Right, okay. And I was wondering how you think about what kind of capital you feel you need
to run the business under Basel III? I realize that you put out the 6.9% in the discussion here on page 15. I'm just
wondering, what are some of the major elements that differentiate the Basel I versus the Basel III? Because we didn't
get any detail on that. And how do you plan on managing that going forward? I'm just trying to understand what kind of
excess capital level you have?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay. Well let me try it
with you this way. First, as you know historically, we've always run the company with very strong capital ratios.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Right.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: The 7% Tier 1 common
that we had prior to 2008 was at the top end of the industry and served us pretty well when we went to buy Wachovia.
Our Tier 1 common today under Basel I is now 20% higher than that already strong capital ratio. So on a Basel I basis,
we already think the company is being operated at very, very strong capital levels and of course, given our capital
generation, we'll see how high that goes. If that translates back to roughly a 7% Tier 1 common under Basel III, that
also feels about right to us and that's before taking into account other things that the regulators may require, that
appears to be about where the regulators are coming out now on Basel III. So 7% Basel III, 8% to 8.25% on Basel I for
Tier 1 common feels like an appropriate target for us going forward.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Betsy, I'd just add this, I have to
agree with where – because, Howard, we've talked about this a lot at this company. I think the part that Basel III got
right was around calibrating the risk and this company just runs with a lot less risk. If you look at how we fund our
balance sheet, the level of core deposits, the kind of credit and other risks that we take and manage and so forth,
running at about a 7% Basel III number, give or take seems like that's strong capital.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: And so the RWAs that you've got in the Basel III is point in time what you have today or does
include mitigation?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No mitigation. We don't
feel that mitigation is necessary because again, remember, as John mentioned, we will have a much smaller impact
from Basel III than the other banks because we don't have the same risk -

<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: – level that other
companies do. And it's a quite significant advantage for us, and will not lead us to have to take mitigating actions just
given where we are, given how rapidly our capital's been growing.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: And anything on the M&A front outside the depository business?
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, the biggest issue right now is
finishing Wachovia. We've had opportunity to look at things that could or could not be interesting, like there's
consolidation going on in the industry, but we simply want to – we're over two-thirds through this and we want to
really do this exceedingly well. I mentioned in the past we have an interest in growing our insurance distribution
business and we're doing a lot of things organically, but there are some opportunities as that industry consolidates and
the Wealth, Brokerage Retirement business and asset management. Those are other areas that we have, I think,
opportunities to play a larger role, in many cases just serving our existing customers.
So if there is things that are opportunistic, terrific. If there is things that are not opportunistic, we have so much to do
organically. But, and you know this, the Wachovia thing really did change the reach of this company. It was such a
wonderful merger and acquisition. It really gave us a lot of what we needed to play on the national stage in many of our
businesses.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Right. That's why I was wondering if there's any fill-ins in the non-depository businesses that
you might have on the radar screen?
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, sure. Like I said, some of the
wealth and asset management things and some in distribution, but there's not a big gaping hole in our product suite or
our menu that's problematic for us today, either geography or product.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay. And then just last on the TRUPS, callable TRUPS. I'm looking at about $4.6 billion in
callable TRUPS right now. Is that accurate? Or am I off on that number?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We have, as you know,
about $21 billion in total. Some of that will convert by its terms to qualifying forms of preferred and we have about $11
billion or $12 billion left that theoretically could be callable.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: If you were to pay up?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No. Just callable.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.
<Q - Brian Foran>: I guess as a follow up to that last one, there's still a decent-sized gap between net income and net
income to common, so is working down preferred dividends an opportunity as well?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, again to the extent
that that represents qualifying capital, we're not going to call stuff that represents qualifying capital.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Okay. And then, just more broadly on recapture. USB kind of mentioned 50% as a guess for the
overall recapture rate across all the regulatory stuff that's happening and seemed to kind of indicate it'll happen starting
in 2011 versus 2012. If I put everything you're saying together, is that translating to a rough, similar ballpark? Or how
should we think about overall recapture rates and timing?

<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We've not given a number, Brian, and
we are busy about changing some products, looking for ways to add value and get paid for that. But we've not – for us,
we don't even know what the debit thing will be yet. That's still in play. We've just not given a number on that.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And, frankly, the – it
depends on what you call recapture because, as we said before, some of this is going to be fee increases, some of it's
going to become – is going to be expense management, some of it is going to come from greater volume as we increase
the value proposition to our customers. So, again, I don't know how you do a math on that.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We're trying to look at a balanced
approach and a multidimensional approach. Some of it will – different customers have different levels of profitability
with us. We have not been sitting around here just hoping. We've been working very hard about strengthening our
relationship model. In fact, the relationship model we employ here is probably the best thing, the best anecdote to
what's happening in the regulatory reform arena because as we deepen relationships, profitability grows exponentially
as we add products arithmetically. So I think it's a work in progress.
<Q - Brian Foran>: If I could follow up this way, I mean, some of the stuff that's going to happen, seems like maybe
annual fees on debit cards, maintenance fees on low balance accounts, stuff that's going to be not particularly popular
with customers. So is it better to move with the industry on that? Or is it better to wait and be the last one to do that and
gauge how customers move around and maybe pick up market share by still offering a free product?
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's best to serve your customers
and put their interests – they understand we have to get paid. Nobody can operate a business at a loss. And we're going
to get paid differently. So it might not be an increase. And like Howard mentioned, we're also tightening our belt. And
we're going to try to drive our cost down so we can be more competitive. So I think it's a – I don't know that it's an
early or later kind of thing, it's about serving customers and evolve. We're always evolving. In fact if you look back,
I've been in this industry 35 years, the way we got paid for a checking account was very different 35 years ago than it
was 20 years ago, than it is today. So things change.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And again, not to make too
fine a point about it as we said, this is about the customer and the revenue we earn from the customer, not about the fee.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: I just – a question on the loan growth, the C&I increase was very encouraging this quarter. I
just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the drivers to that. Was it actual increase in line utilization rates?
Was it more new clients and what about generally your expectations as we head into the first half of '11 here?
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Joe, it's more on new clients and not on
– utilization rates really have not changed. That still is dry powder. But we are out winning more relationships. And it's
more in that area.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Joe, as you know from
public data, there has been an increase in total loans in the system the last quarter or two. But as I pointed out on the
market share tables, we've increased market share. And that tells you that we've been picking up relationships during

this period.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Right. Okay.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: But we are hearing more comments
from our customers that where a year ago you didn't hear about, as much about, I'm thinking of adding a plant or
adding some people or doing this or whatever, you're hearing more of that today. But typically what happens is you see
some run down in deposit balances, then you see the borrowing.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Right. Okay. Thanks. And then a second – just a couple quick questions on the mortgage
repurchase stuff. I guess first, have you explored at all a possible settlement with the GSEs of the outstanding pipelines
of claims? Or have they approached you at all? And then also the provision for losses, while overall still low, was up
from the last several quarters. You talked about increased severity, is that primarily on the private label side or across
the board? And any other comments you could share there would be helpful.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Again, the loss severity is
just our estimate based on what we're seeing in both portfolios. As we've indicated, the larger of the two issues for us is
still the agency side of it. We've had virtually nothing on the private side. And as far as a global settlement, again, as
we've said before, this is a rapidly declining issue for us. And we think we're very well reserved. So, I'm not sure a
settlement would make a lot of sense.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Joe, I think of it in these terms. This is a
very issuer or company-specific kind of thing. And you've got to look at what's going on, what you have in the
portfolio, percentages prime, percentages current and all of that. So – because it makes – might make sense for one
company, it's again, very unique by company.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul Miller>: Thank you very much. Now as you're becoming more of a national franchise, is there any one area
where you're seeing more economic growth or more loan demand or more positive comments than – like is it the south
or is it California?
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, sure. We see there's things are
different. Texas tends to be – our business there is doing quite well and so I think it depends on where the states are or
the areas of the country that are into certain economies. The – where you have a housing basis for the economy, that's
more difficult. Where there's energy or agriculture it tends to be a little better, so it reflects that. But I would say the
general mood is and the general feeling is that while it's tepid so far, there is a recovery in place. Things are better than
they were a year-ago. Not as good as they need to be, not as good as they will be, hopefully, and jobs are still the big
issue. But it's certainly – there's a little more spring in the step of our customer, business and consumer.
<Q - Paul Miller>: And then on the deposit side, I mean, a lot of – you're probably with the best – you're the best
deposit base out there. But is it the case of your liquidities really building up, are you starting to push out some
non-core deposits or just trying to maybe not be such a good deposit gatherer in this market? I mean because eventually
this stuff will move out?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, remember the
deposits we're talking about here, that we've been gathering are checking accounts and savings accounts, they're not
CDs and time deposits. So in effect the way we've been thinking about and pricing CDs is not to take the higher cost
money and just continue to get the growth in customer-operating balance is really what this is all about. And what that

really says is, we've been successful at growing the number of customers who are doing business with us and getting
more of their operating balances and not that we're pricing to get more time deposits.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Paul, we are really focusing this
company on checking account – what I would call transactional deposit growth because what that means is you're
winning households. It's one of my favorite things to do every morning when I get here, is read the deposit report from
the day before. Because when you're growing checking accounts, you're growing households. And the checking
account and the mortgage, frankly, are about two of the biggest hooks you can get. And when we see – Florida last
year, we grew checking accounts by 10%. We all know Florida did not grow households by 10%, but they might have
had – might have been even or maybe there was an outflow last year. So we are gaining share. And the same thing is
true in New Jersey and even in California here, we grew by over 8%.
So – and while those deposits might not be that valuable today, because where are you going to invest them, let me tell
you that is our life blood. We're going to like those and those relationships a lot. We like them a lot today. We're going
to like them even more in the future.
<Q - Paul Miller>: Okay. Thanks a lot, gentlemen.

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.
<Q - Ed Najarian>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Ed.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Ed Najarian>: Just want to maybe follow-up a little bit on John's initial question about how much liquidity you
have on the balance sheet. There was a line in your third quarter 10-Q that talked about being able to, at some point
invest a lot of excess liquidity into investment securities. And I'm sort of wondering what your thoughts are in terms of
how you would invest that and what kind of thresholds we would need to see from an interest rate standpoint for you to
think about investing more aggressively in terms of some of that excess liquidity? And then I also have a follow-up
question. Thanks.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, the best way we can
invest that liquidity is if we get loan growth, right? And we think we are particularly well leveraged for loan growth.
We gave you the data on loan outstanding increases, but I should also mention that while loans have not gone up
significantly, we have been very active in growing the number of new lines and committed facilities. So once loan
demand actually comes back, it could come back pretty quickly here for us.
In terms of the investment portfolio, we've been saying for many quarters now that we've been keeping our powder dry.
We did do some investing in the fourth quarter when rates started moving up and we actually, as I mentioned, sold
some of the lowest yielding securities we've had in the portfolio and repositioned that up into the higher yields than
were prevailing at the end of the quarter.
I can also tell you, Ed, that if you look back historically at securities that we bought for the portfolio, typically that has
been mortgage-backed securities, just plain vanilla agency mortgage-backed securities, which we think is good for our
portfolio given the long duration of our liabilities.
And secondly, we typically in the past have not bought securities of that kind unless rates were up in the sort of 5%-ish
level or higher. Now that's a yield level that may have been more relevant for the past than for the future, so I'm not
suggesting necessarily that that's the right benchmark going forward, but throughout most of 2010 at least,
mortgage-backed security yields just felt awfully low to us relative to both history and relative to earnings that were
coming through for us in the mortgage business.

<Q - Ed Najarian>: So I take it we should think about you not being too aggressive in terms of investing in terms of
growing the MBS portfolio unless we see a material additional pick up in rates?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. And again, that
could change because the one thing that could change that thought a little bit is we do have to look at the total balance
sheet and we don't want to have our liability durations moving too far, too fast away from our asset durations. So we
are trying to keep a relatively balanced balance sheet. But all other things aside, yeah, we prefer seeing higher yields
before beginning to load up on the portfolio.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: But, Ed, you're asking the right question
because there's a lot earnings power there. I mean, there's a lot of – when you look at the spread we're getting on those
excess dollars today, it's minimal. So there's a real opportunity.
<Q - Ed Najarian>: Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up question has to do with mortgage servicing
income and sort of the rate positioning of your servicing portfolio. Prior to the third quarter, we went through a number
of quarters where you were getting market-related MSR valuation gains, net of the hedge, as rates were falling. In the
third and fourth quarter, that didn't happen. In fact it looked like a net loss this quarter and I'm looking at the table on
the top of page 43.
And I'm just wondering, you've always traditionally talked about how the servicing portfolio was a natural offset to the
origination side of the business and I'm just wondering if you are adopting sort of a view that rates will rise over time
and in that sense, are you thinking about sort of not completely hedging the servicing portfolio so that if rates do rise,
we could get some net gains in terms of the valuation of the servicing portfolio, net of the hedge, or do you just want to
keep it as well-hedged as possible and not really think about that as a source of potential revenue?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, a lot of things in
response to that question. First of all, we're not necessarily operating with a view that rates have to go up, but we at
least want to make sure that we are properly protected in the case they do. As far as the hedge is concerned, the actual
hedge result in the quarter was really close to zero, as I mentioned in my remarks, because the reported numbers
included the additional cost for servicing of foreclosure expense that went through the MSR in the quarter. So you take
that away and we were at, really at zero.
And the third point I'd make, in terms of the size of the hedge and the composition of the hedge, obviously that's
changing all the time and is a function of yield curves and rate levels and spreads between mortgage assets and
treasuries and LIBOR and so on. So there's really no singular answer to that question, but yes, following your thought,
to the extent that we felt that higher interest rates were more likely than lower interest rates, we might actually reduce
the size of the hedge, and therefore benefit by a greater up valuation of the asset relative to cost of the hedge should
rates go up. Again, I'm not saying that that's where we are, but theoretically that could happen, in that circumstance
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Another piece that gets involved in that
analysis, Ed, is what's the carry on the hedge? So if you're doing really well on the carry, you might want to be more
matched versus – so this is something that we go through every Monday morning. It gets lots of management attention
around here and – but Howard's right, if we're convinced that there's a high probability that rates are going to go up, in
the past we've employed strategy and maybe less hedged and that's always on the table.
<Q - Ed Najarian>: Okay. And not to sort of belabor the point, but I guess it seems very likely that origination
revenue will decline from third and fourth quarter levels. So I guess, more to the point, should we think about probably
mortgage banking revenue going down or do you think there's an offset available in the servicing portfolio revenue if
origination volume does drop?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You are touching on the
point as to why we think of the mortgage business as being a balanced business between servicing and origination. So
that when we do our simulations and everything in terms of what impact interest rates may have on the business
holistically, we look at both sides of the business and take into account effects on both sides of the business and the

Your next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.
<Q - Frederick Cannon>: Thanks and good morning. Just kind of as a follow up. The FHA/FHFA proposed earlier
this week to cut the servicing fee for the GSEs and I was curious as to your thoughts in terms of the impact to that on
Wells Fargo and how – what you guys think of that proposal?
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Fred, conditions over the past few years
have caused many, both in the industry and policy positions to rethink servicing contracts and what's going on there.
Any changes likely, if there are changes, they'd be prospective in nature and it's probably more than a year or so away
whatever will be decided. So it's probably too early to give you any view on impact, but let me just say this, it's
probably – it could be neutral to us, because we're both in the origination business and the servicing business.
So if you allocate less of the – of what the customer pays, allocate less of that to a capitalized servicing asset, you
probably get more than on your gain on sale. So – and there are pluses and minuses in having a smaller servicing asset.
You can hedge less, so I'm not – so I think what I'm suggesting is it's still in the very early stages. It's still being
discussed. It's probably going to be prospective if anything, on new volume and I'm not sure that it's – that this is more
about geography and less about economics.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think essentially what this
really means is that, if it happens as John says, that less of the gain on sale when you sell a mortgage is attributable to
the servicing asset and more of the gain on sale just comes through as an -
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Cash.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: – origination gain in cash.
One interesting potential benefit, if you will, if this happens, again as John mentioned, is that the – simply the amount
of capitalized servicing on the balance sheet will be less over time. And that has some positive implications if you will
under Basel III, which caps the amount of capitalized servicing that can be counted as Tier 1 common. So there are
some interesting benefits from that if it happens without really changing the economics of the business.
<Q - Frederick Cannon>: Great. I mean I just kind of viewed it as probably a positive for you in that gain on sale as
determined in the marketplace wouldn't change much, more gain on sale would be cash and your servicing asset would
be smaller, freeing up some capital, while the actual reported income probably wouldn't change much. Is that kind of a
fair characterization of thinking about? Obviously as was stated, it would play itself out over an extended period of
time.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think that's a short and
sweet way of thinking about it. Yep.
<Q - Frederick Cannon>: Okay. Great. One other quick question, Howard. In terms of interpreting the Fed's policy in
terms of dividends, obviously, you all are going through a stress test and have to get that all buttoned up. Secondly,
they did discuss Basel III kind of reaching that 7% level. Should we interpret the Fed's statement as saying before you
kind of increase dividends you have to be at that 7% Basel III level? Or simply just have to have a plan to get there in
the near term?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think – the best way I
could answer that is to say that Basel III is still evolving. I don't know whether there'll be a soft or a hard or any kind of
requirement for 7% under Basel III, but as you know, if there is one, we're already there. So in our case it doesn't really
matter.

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mandle with GIC.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Hi. Thanks. In regard to capital, the 6.9% Basel III, last quarter the Basel III ratio went up more
than the Basel I ratio and you referred to deferred tax assets and using the PCI and so on. So assuming this is just – the
flatness of this quarter versus last quarter as you say was just definitional. Does that mean that as and if Basel I ratio
continues to go up in the next few quarters that the Basel III ratio should again go up faster than the Basel I ratio? For
the reasons you mentioned in the third quarter?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. You can't simply do
the transfer – it's not a fixed spread between the two ratios, Ron. Some quarters the spread between the two may go up,
some may go down. I gave you some factors before. You've got the MSR calculation in there, you've got DTA
[deferred tax assets] -
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Yeah. You referred to PCI.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So on and so forth. So
again, it's really just not a fixed spread between the two. And in this particular quarter, as I say, we had real growth in
those assets that impact the Basel III ratio.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: But going forward we should expect more of a lock step than we saw this quarter? Should we
think of it that way?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No. As I said, it – because
of these other definitional factors for Tier 1 common, I'm not prepared to say that the spread between the two ratios is
going to be fixed and therefore it may or may not go up and down. Generally speaking, the two ratios should move in
the same direction. And simply because the overriding driver of both is internal capital generation, it's earnings. So yes
in that sense, they both should move in the same direction and roughly by the same amount. But plus or minuses for all
the tweaks that come along with Basel III.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Right. Okay. And then my other question is in regard to Durbin. You referred to $250 million
quarterly charge. One question was whether that's pre-tax or after tax?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That would be after tax.
Again, I don't want to put too much precision on that, Ron, because again, that's such an approximated figure at this
point and so preliminary. So we put that out there as kind of a place marker.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Right. No, I just wanted to make sure that it was after tax.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: You mentioned a couple times in discussing it that whether as to if it would be implemented at all
and I was wondering if you could elaborate on that point? It's not clear, to me anyway, under what scenarios it might
not be implemented at all. So if you could elaborate, I'd appreciate it.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well let me just give you a little larger –
or a broader response to that. I don't – I'm not in favor of government price controls as part of a market-based economy
that we have. I just think that's bad as an initial thing as an overall statement. We need a free enterprise and government
that – what product is next? What industry comes next? I've not seen that work in the past very well.

With respect to the issue specifically, it's in the interest, the long-term interest of merchants and consumers and the
financial services industry that we get this right. And right now it's on a fast track. We've got to make sure it gets on the
right track where the people who develop these products, the banks and so forth, this is a big fixed cost business and I
don't know of any industry or business that can continue to grow, innovate, support a product where you don't get paid
for it, and you get paid on a variable rate basis when you have all those fixed costs, so.
And there's real value being created here. Debit cards largely have transplanted cash and check. This is good for
merchants. The cost of handling that cash, the checks, taking the risk, the getting immediate funds with debit is
enormously valuable. And that value creation helps them and we need to get compensated and I don't understand why
cost became the issue.
But anyway, so I think there is good reason and an opportunity for us to sit around and get around a table and make
sure we come up with the right situation. In fact, the President even asked a couple of days ago, that you look at these
regulations. He didn't say this one, but he said regulations in general. And I think this is a great example of something
that we simply have got to get right because at the end of the day, if we can't get paid this way, we've got to get paid a
different way. And we want to make absolutely sure that we make – that customers don't get disadvantaged in this
process.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: John, I understand what you're saying completely, but it seems to me that the Fed is implementing
the law as it currently stands, so unless the law itself changes, I don't see how we go to the environment that you're
describing from where we are now.
<A - John G. Stumpf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we will be prepared for whatever
outcome, but we're going to make the point as an industry that in this case we need to really understand what we're
doing here.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We have time for one more
question.

And your final question comes from the line of Adam Barkstrom with Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Adam Barkstrom>: Hey, gentlemen. Good morning.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Adam Barkstrom>: Hey wanted to – not to pound you guys on the dividend question, but just at some point
obviously you guys are going to be given the green light to increase dividend, and I'm just curious from your
perspective, do you think that's going to – and let's just say 30% payout is kind of the bogey. I mean would you
envision kind of jumping up to the 30%? Or gradually working your way through to that number? And then I have one
follow-up.
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Really can't talk about the
specific submission to the Fed or let alone what the Fed may or may not approve. So a lot of this is really going to be
up to the Fed.
<Q - Adam Barkstrom>: Yeah, I guess just to follow, just assuming hypothetically that 30% give or take is the
number, would you envision getting to that number very quickly or more in a gradual process?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, again as I said,
restoring a more normal dividend, buying back shares, calling the TRUPS and continuing to generate more capital are
all important things to us. But at this point, really the best way I can answer the question is it's up to the regulators at
this point.

<Q - Adam Barkstrom>: Got you. Okay. And then, Howard, one last follow up. Any further color you could give us
on margin from here. You mentioned in your opening remarks that you guys sold some of your bond portfolio, the
lowest yield stuff, you've certainly been the – benefited from some nice loan growth this quarter. Should we expect
looking out maybe a gradual turn in the margin from here?
<A - Howard I. Atkins, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: The margin really is a
result of many things that occur on the balance sheet and in our earnings and what we're trying to do is grow net
interest income and revenue and the margin will be what the margin will be. We, to the extent we have continued
success in growing checking and savings, that'll increase the margin, frankly if loan demand accelerates, that'll be great
for the top line, but it may actually reduce the margin if we're not growing deposits at the same fast rate. So lots of
things can happen to the margin here, which as I say are just the result of many, many other things that we're trying to
do.
