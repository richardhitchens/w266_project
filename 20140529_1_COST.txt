MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Bridget and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Quarter Three Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.
Richard A. Galanti
Thank you, Bridget, and good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our third quarter operating
results for the 12-week period ended May 11. The discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such
statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other
risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.
To begin with, our 12-week third quarter results, operating results, for the quarter, our reported earnings per share came
in at $1.07 per share compared to last year's third quarter earnings per share of $1.04. As I go through the line item
detail on the income statement, I'll point out a few factors that impacted earnings both up a little and down a little. One
item that I'll point out up front of course is the FX impact to the entire income statement. The FX impact of weaker
foreign exchange rates year-over-year, when reporting profits from our international operations that represented a little
over $17 million pre-tax or between $0.025 and $0.03 a share impact to the P&L to the negative.

As an example, year-over-year in the third quarter the Canadian exchange rate, the Canada dollar relative to U.S. dollar
was down about 8%. Japan yen down about 6% year-over-year. Offsetting a little bit from strengthening foreign
currencies of U.K. and Korea and a couple of others, but dwarfed of course by Canada.
In terms of sales for the quarter, total sales were up 7% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure was up 4%.
For the quarter, sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation, which was about a 25 basis point impact. And by
weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year which in the aggregate impacted sales by about 140
basis points to the negative.
Excluding gas, the reported 5% U.S. comp sales increase in Q3 would have been a 6%. Reported plus 3% international
comp figure, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 8%. The total company comp which we reported at plus 4%
for the quarter, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 6% for the whole company.
In terms of new openings, after opening 16 new locations in the first half of fiscal 2014 and the closing of our Acapulco
location earlier this fiscal year due to the hurricane damage, we opened four new locations in Q3; two in the U.S., one
in Louisiana and one in Texas; and one each in Japan and Korea.
All told, that puts our 2014 fiscal year openings through the third quarter end at 20. Since third quarter ends on May 15,
we opened our first Costco in Spain in Seville, and this week we are opening our sixth location in Australia in
Brisbane, our 11th Korea location and our 20th Costco in Japan, so three openings outside of the U.S. this week.
By week end, we'll be operating 657 locations worldwide and after that and through the end of the fiscal 2014 on
August 31, we expect to open six more locations, four in the U.S. and one each in Canada and the U.K., such that we'll
most likely end the fiscal year with 30 new openings less the one closing in Acapulco or 663 Costcos worldwide as of
August 31.
This morning I'll review with you our e-commerce activity, our membership trends and renewal rates, recent common
stock repurchase activities, and of course a discussion about the various line items of the income statement.
So on to the results, as I mentioned, actually total sales for the quarter came in at $25.2 billion, up 7% from last year's
$23.5 billion. On a reported comp basis, Q3 comps again were 4% for the quarter on a reported basis, 6% excluding gas
and FX. Now looking at the 4% reported comp sales figure, it was a combination of an average transaction increase of
0.2% up. Of course, that was on a reported basis. Excluding gas and FX the average transaction was up just under 2%.
And an average frequency increase of up 4.3%, which by the way is the same number year-to-date through the third
quarter.
In terms of sales comparisons by geography, within the U.S., the Southeast and the Midwest were the strongest in high
single digits. Internationally in local currencies, Australia was the weakest due to cannibalization on a relatively small
base of existing units with Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, and Canada all coming in at local currency in the plus-8% to
plus-10% range.
In terms of merchandise categories, sales results for the quarter, for the third quarter within food and sundries, overall
in the mid single digits. Frozen food, candy and meat deli were relative standouts. Hardlines, which overall was just
above flat, about 0.5% up. Departments with the strongest results were office and automotive. Consumer electronics
sales were down in the low to mid singles. Within the mid to high single digit softline comps, small electrics, domestics
and apparel were standouts. And in fresh foods, comp sales were up 8% with produce and meat being strongest. A little
inflation on the meat side.
Moving down the income statement, membership fees came in at $561 million, up 6% or about $30 million
year-over-year and down 3 basis points as a percent of sales. Again, FX, that $30 million increase would have been $38
million assuming flat year-over-year currency exchange rates.
In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, continue to tick up a little bit. U.S. and Canada, for
the quarter, was up – the renewal rate through the quarter-end was 90.6% so first time averaging, rounding upward, and
87.3% worldwide.

Again, we see continued increased penetration of the Executive Membership and I'll speak about that in a minute.
Overall, new member sign-ups in Q3 were up about 1%. A lot of that, sometimes it's up a little, sometimes it's down a
little. It really is impacted by, particularly by some of the Asia opening schedules where we get outsized due to member
sign-ups.
In terms of members at yearend -I'm sorry, Q3 end. At the end of the third quarter, Gold Star members totaled 30.6
million, up from 30.1 million 12 weeks earlier. Primary business, 6.8 million up from 6.7 million 12 weeks ago, and
business add-on was steady at 3.5 million so all told, member households 40.9 million at Q3 end, up from 40.3 million
at the end of second quarter. And including the add-on cards, the extra card, total cards outstanding, 74.6 million at Q3
end, up from 73.4 million 12 weeks earlier. At May 11, Q3 end, paid Executive Memberships were just shy of 14.4
million, representing an increase during the quarter of a little over 300,000 new Executive members or about a 26,000
per week increase in the quarter. Executive members continue to be about a little over a third of our member base and a
little over two-thirds of our sales.
As I mentioned earlier, our renewal rates have continued to tick up. Business members at Q3 end were at 94.4% up
from 94.3% renewal rate 12 weeks earlier, Gold Star 89.7% up from 89.6%. So all told, 90.6% versus 90.4%. And
worldwide, I mentioned the 87.3% number. That was up from 86.8% 12 weeks earlier at the end of Q2.
Continuing down the income statement to gross margin. Gross margin year-over-year in the third quarter came in at
10.62% of sales, down 5 basis points from last year's 10.67%. If we jot down the following little matrix and I'll explain
it, I'll walk through it, there'll be four columns and six line items. The line items would be core merchandising; second
line item would be ancillary businesses; third line item would be 2% reward; fourth line item, LIFO, fifth line item
would be other; and then total would be the sixth line item, total.
The four columns would be reported in Q2 2014. The second column would be without gas deflation in Q2 2014. And
then columns three and four would be for Q3 2014 both columns, and again, reported and without gas deflation.
So again, going across those four columns. Core merchandising was plus 1 basis point in Q2 2014 on a reported basis
year-over-year. Without gas was minus 1 basis point. For Q3 it was plus 9 basis points and plus 7 basis points.
Ancillary businesses were, again, reading across the four columns, zero basis points, zero basis points, plus 1 basis
point and zero basis points.
2% reward, minus 1 basis point and minus 1 basis point. And then for Q3 2014, both reported and without, would be
zero basis points and zero basis points; LIFO minus 6 basis points and minus 6 basis points, and for the Q3 2014, minus
8 basis points and minus 8 basis points. Other, zero basis points and zero basis points. And Q3 2014 would be minus 7
basis points and minus 7 basis points. So all told, it was minus 6 basis points year-over-year in Q2 2014 on a reported
basis. In Q2 2014 without gas deflation it was minus 8 basis points total. And then in Q3 2014 reported and without
would be minus 5 basis points and minus 8 basis points respectively.
So as you can see, the overall reported gross margin was lower year-over-year by 5 basis points, minus 8 basis points
without gas deflation. However, our core merchandise gross margin was up year-over-year both with and without gas
deflation of 9 basis points and 7 basis points respectively.
For the third quarter, on the merchandise categories on sales, food and sundries gross margins were up in the 20 basis
point range year-over-year, while hardlines and softlines were in the high single-digit basis points increase range
year-over-year. Fresh foods gross margins was just slightly lower year-over-year, less than 5 basis points delta, which
is actually a relative improvement from recent quarterly performance in that area.
LIFO, in the third quarter we recorded a $12 million or 5 basis point minus pre-tax charge for the quarter. That
compared to last year in Q3 of an $8 million or plus 3 basis point pre-tax credit due to deflation a year ago. So
year-over-year it was a $20 million swing or about $0.03 a share.
In terms of inflation, LIFO, if I looked at just as one representative factor, data point in that, if I looked at our U.S.
inventories, looking at the LIFO calculations, our Q2 end versus Q3 end, in the 12 weeks there was about a quarter of a
percentage point delta in the LIFO index. With foods, not food sundries but canned goods and the like, was up a little

over 1% during those 12 weeks.
Lastly, other; last year in the quarter, gross margin benefited from a nonrecurring legal settlement received last year in
Q3. This accounted for about a 7 basis point minus swing year-over-year, both with and without gas. There was a little
over a $17 million pre-tax benefit last year in Q3, again related to this legal settlement, which was about right around
$0.025 a share.
Moving down to SG&A. Our SG&A percentages were higher by 4 basis points year-over-year, coming in at a 9.86% of
sales this year compared to a 9.82% a year ago. As I did with the gross margin, I'll ask you to do the four columns. First
two columns are Q2 2014 and Q2 2014, both reported and without gas deflation. And then Q3 2014 and Q3 2014
reported and without gas deflation. The five line items would be operations, then central, then RSUs or stock
compensation, then quarterly adjustments, and then total.
Again, going across, operations, the first number would be minus 12 basis points, meaning that in Q2 2014
year-over-year the core represented a 12 basis point increase year-over-year in SG&A, then a minus 9 basis points. And
then in Q3 2014 those two columns will be a plus 3 basis points and a plus 5 basis points, or the core operations was
improved by 3 basis points and 5 basis points respectively.
Central, going across the four columns, zero basis points and zero basis points, and then minus 2 basis points and minus
2 basis points, meaning a little higher year over year. RSUs, minus 1 basis points and minus 1 basis points. In Q3,
minus 5 basis points and minus 4 basis points. There were no quarterly adjustments, so in that fourth line item it'd be
zeros across. And then the final row, the total, minus 13 basis points and minus 10 basis points. And in Q3 2014
reported SG&A, again, was higher year over year by 4 basis points, so minus 4 there basis points, without gas a minus
1 basis point.
In terms of a little editorial on these numbers, the operations component of SG&A again was three basis points better
year over year in Q3 and five better excluding gas deflation. Within warehouse operations our payroll as a percent of
sales was lower year over year by – or improvement by about 5 basis points. Total payroll dollars increased a little over
5% in Q3 compared to that 7% total sales increase. Benefits of workers' comp hit SG&A by about 3 basis points year
over year. So that was a little bit of offset to that improvement.
Our central expense, it was higher year over year in Q3 by 2 basis points, which is actually the same number as related
to the ongoing IT modernization; incremental modernization cost that was 2 basis point hit to the quarter. There are a
couple other things that went both ways, but that would be the one thing I'd point out there.
Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense was up $6 million from $10 million last
year in Q3 to $16 million this year. We actually had one more opening last year, five last year versus four this year.
Although that timing of that relates to both things after the quarter as well. I might also point out of course, with the
opening of Spain, you always have a significant pre-opening expense related to the opening of the country itself in that
first warehouse. That was about $4 million of that $16 million number for Q3 this year.
All told, operating income in Q3 2014 came in at $737 million, higher by $15 million from last year's $722 million.
Below operating income, interest expense came in at $25 million in both this year's and last year's fiscal third quarter.
Over 95% of it relates to the interest expense related to the 10-year maturing $1.1 billion debt we have that matures in
2017 and the $3.5 billion of debt that matures over the next two to six years that we did back in December of 2012.
Interest income and other, it was lower year over year by $3 million, so coming in at $15 million last year relative to
this year or this quarter of $12 million positive. Actual interest income for the quarter was higher by $2 million.
The other component of interest income and other amounted to $1 million positive this year versus a $6 million
positive last year. So a minus $5 million swing. The majority of this negative earnings relates to the negative impact of
mark-to-market adjustments on forward FX contracts used to source U.S. goods and certain foreign operations.
Swings are caused by changes in the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies, local currency in certain foreign locations
as compared to the prior year. And this, we just point it out as part of that impact; sometimes it's a little positive,
sometimes it's a little negative.

Overall, pre-tax income was higher year over year by $12 million in third quarter, coming in last year at $712 million
and this year up $12 million to $724 million. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate this quarter came in a little better or
lower at 33.9% versus 34.8% last year. This was primarily due to the higher year-over-year penetration of profits
coming from our foreign operations, which overall have lower tax rates than in the U.S. Overall, reported net income of
$459 million last year compared to the $473 million of net income this year in the third quarter.
For a quick rundown of other topics, again the balance sheet is included in this morning's press release, but I'll point out
a couple balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $237 million, so year-to-date $708
million. AP as a percent inventories, came down at 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points. On a reported basis it
showed last year 102% accounts payable as a percent of inventories, this year 99%.
If you look at just merchandise payables, not other types of payables like construction payables, last year in Q3 that
102% was a 91%. This year the 91% went from a 99% – is 89%. So still down a couple percentage points year over
year.
Average inventory per warehouse was up about 7% on a per-warehouse basis, coming in at $13.0 million this year up
from $12.2 million last year. The increase was pretty much spread over many departments. Apparel was probably the
biggest delta. The men's, women's and children's apparel was up year-over-year about a little under $200,000. And
foods and candy was up $150,000. Overall though we feel our inventory is in good shape and not a whole lot to talk
about there.
In terms of CapEx, in first quarter we spent $574 million. In the second quarter this year we spent $447 million and in
the third quarter just ended we spent $405 million. So Q3 year-to-date we're just a little over $1.4 billion. Our estimate
for the year for CapEx is we'll come in at about $2.2 billion compared to last year's expenditures for the whole year of
$2.1 billion, so up slightly from last year.
In terms of Costco Online, we continue to operate Costco Online in the four countries that I've mentioned in the prior
quarter: U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico; U.K. and Mexico of course being much newer than the U.S. and Canada
operations. For Q3 sales and profits are up. Sales were up 16% year-over-year in the quarter. A little impact from again
weak Canadian dollar, but overall 16% on reported basis.
I've talked about the various things we've done in the last year, year-and-a-half in terms of re-platforming and adding
mobile apps and combining some of e-commerce merchandising buying efforts with some of our online efforts. We've
added a few categories like apparel, some limited apparel items and some limited health and beauty items. We've
started to ship out of more than one depot to improve timing of shipments on some of the bigger ticket items as well.
Outside of e-commerce there's a couple things that in the Internet area or things that are we're testing. I mentioned
before the Google test. Google Shopping Express in the Bay Area. More recently in the last several weeks it's being
tested in Los Angeles with several retailers, not just us, but in Los Angeles at our Culver City location and in
Manhattan at our Manhattan location. Both those two cities [ph] have been (20:17) just in the last four to six weeks.
Also we've tested a few – from a membership sign-up standpoint a couple of social media area – social media
initiatives with LivingSocial and zulily.
Next on the discussion list in terms of expansion, again, through Q3-end we've opened 20 units. And we don't have the
current closing of the Acapulco location earlier this year because of the hurricane. Q4 in total including the few that
we've already opened we'd expect to open 10. So again, 30 openings less the Acapulco location would be 29 net
increase for the year.
So looking back over the last year, year-and-a-half, in fiscal 2013 for the entire year we added 26 units on a base of
608. So about 4.5% square footage growth. This year assuming the 30 net new units to be 4.5% to 5% square footage
growth. And again of the 30 openings this year, 17 would be in the U.S., 3 in Canada, 1 in the U.K., 2 in Korea and 2 in
Japan, 3 in Australia and 1 each in Mexico and Spain. As of Q3-end total square footage stood at 93.7 million square
feet.

Next item, stock repurchases; as mentioned on the call, I guess about 12 weeks ago, that we would – and anticipate we
begin buying back some stock. We began our recent repurchase activities on March 7. I think that was the day after our
second quarter earnings results were released. For those nine weeks since then through the end of the third quarter, we
purchased 1.6, a little over 1.6 million shares at an average price of $113.14 for total dollars expended during those
nine weeks of $183.6 million.
In terms of dividends our quarterly dividend per share increased with a May dividend payment from $0.31 per share on
quarterly basis to $0.355, so about a 14.5% increase. This $1.42 per share annualized dividend represents a total cost to
the company of about $625 million a year.
Lastly, our fourth quarter scheduled earnings release will be Thursday, October 9. That will be for the 16-week fiscal
fourth quarter ending on August 31.
With that I'll open it up for Q&A and turn it back to Bridget. Bridget?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.
<Q - Charles. Grom>: Hey, Richard. Good morning. How are you?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Good.
<Q - Charles. Grom>: Just on the core up 7% and then the fresh foods being down slightly year-over-year, just
wondering if you could remind us how that fresh foods margin has trended over the past couple of quarters. And given
the inflation that we are seeing today, what is kind of your expectation for that over the next 16 weeks?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, well, as you said, I can't give you a whole lot information about the expectations. I
can tell you a little bit about what's happened both the quarter and year-to-date. If I look year-to-date at those
components, fresh foods year-to-date, let's see. Do I have that here? Hold on. I'm looking at the wrong sheet here. Total
consolidated. Fresh foods year-to-date was down about 22 basis points and that includes down the 4, 5 or sub-5 this
quarter. So for the first half of the year, it would have been more than that minus 22.
<Q - Charles. Grom>: Okay, so what's the change? What has changed as part of that? Is it a little bit of better relief on
the pricing front or is it something different?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think the one thing that I pointed out in the last is that certainly I mentioned historically
that we've kept our rotisserie chicken the same price for the last two years when costs dramatically increased. We've
seen some relief there in the last quarter. So a little of it is that probably. That's one item. That's a huge item in terms of
that factor. But beyond that, it's a conscious effort. We want to be ever competitive but we're also trying to show a little
margin improvement. So that's the only thing I could point out.
In general as it relates to inflation, we tend to be the laggard when there's inflationary pressure. My guess is that when I
look at the core components of the food and sundries up, because that's where there was more inflation. There's also
some LIFO charge related to that. Overall, when prices are going up quickly, ultimately we have to raise some of them
but we're probably going to be slower than others. But again, that's on a general basis. Overall, beyond that, I don't
think there's a whole lot to talk about in terms of trend there.
<Q - Charles. Grom>: Okay. And then I know you will probably disclose this in your Q, but if you could just shed a
little bit of light on operating margin performance internationally and then also in the U.S. and how that compared to
last year.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think we're still cross checking those numbers. And that will be out in the Q. Generally
speaking, the trends that you've seen continue. FX doesn't play into those numbers from the standpoint of percentages

because FX hits every line item on a Canadian P&L, as an example. Canada continues to be more profitable as a
percent of sales than the U.S. And other international overall tends to be in that direction. It's skewed a little bit on a
smaller base of total units when you open in Spain or you cannibalize some units in a country, but overall, I think that
it's fair to say that columns two and three, with column one being in the U.S., are more profitable as percent of sales
than the U.S.
<Q - Charles. Grom>: Okay. Then just last question; in April you called out the State of California as improving, the
entire state. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that improvement. Do you think it sustainable and I guess what do
you think was driving it?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I don't know. It's sustainable so far. I don't know in the future. But when I called out
just geographically some of the numbers, I think California, again, the ones that I called out were Southeast and
Midwest. California actually was a little better than the Northeast and the Northwest. Pretty close to the total for the
company. So overall, I'd say California continues to do a little better, given its maturity and size. I can't tell you why
though.
<Q - Charles. Grom>: All right. Good. Thanks.

And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So, Richard, just a quick follow-up on the inflation question. A number of companies have
said in the last four to six weeks they have seen a sea change in some items; it's all perishable. Have you seen anything
like that or what you are seeing is more gradual?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, when I look at just again the various LIFO pools for U.S. inventories, which is one
indication, the LIFO pools of course are the cost pools – back-like items year-over-year, and again you start the new
year at a cost of 100.00 for everything. If I look at what I would call the foods pool, this is not fresh foods but it's
canned goods, cereal, all types of food items like that, that's up a little over 2.5% from the beginning of the fiscal year.
In the last quarter, in the last 12 weeks of these 36 weeks it's up about 1.2%. So, almost half of that delta.
So you ask that is it a sea change, I haven't looked at it that closely in fairness. When I look across items, in terms of
inflationary items, again, I'm just shooting down the list, looking at the top 25 most impactful items to our LIFO
calculation, there are several nuts on there. Almonds, pistachios, walnuts all in the high teens to low 30s. There are
some seafood items. There is – generally speaking those are the types of items. There's few produce items. That tends
to be item based not all produce based, based on where a drought or a freeze or the rain was. On the deflationary side
it's the usual suspects, a bunch of electronics. Not a whole – that's a lot of the items. A couple of small apparel items.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. Again, I guess beef in total would be a bigger – is that a bigger sales item in total
than your chicken products?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. Yeah, beef overall I think in the last – beef prices are up 10% plus in the last quarter
on a year-over-year basis. So, yes. Clearly there's more inflation in that. On the poultry side there's been some inflation,
but we've – we're successful in locking in some stuff as well a little earlier.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Another topic on payrolls, you said up 5% dollars. What's the trend line been on that? It
actually seems like a pretty good performance for you. Are you doing anything different process-wise in the clubs to try
to tweak that a little bit?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I don't have it in front of me. I think the last few quarters when I pointed out payroll,
that's generally been a slight benefit basis point wise which would indicate the dollars increase a shade less than sales –
total sales increase. I think first and foremost, it's sales. I mean driving the top line is our biggest benefit. Beyond that,
this continues to be a focus on things like overtime hours. Lots of little things like that. I don't know if there's any giant
process changes in the warehouse of late that I can think of.

<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Because that is the total number, right? If you looked at payroll and comp clubs it would
be up less than that, right?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm sorry. What was that?
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: The 5% is a total number. If you looked at it on a comparable basis it would be less than
that. So when you think about at least on a waiver what comp do you need to get leverage, you can get leverage on a
lesser comp than you have been getting. Fair?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes. Probably a little higher than some other retailers, but a little lower than it has been
historically for us. We also probably get a little benefit from increasing penetration overseas where as a percent of sales
it is a lower labor percent.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Yes. Okay, then just one last thing. Monthly coupon book performance, just curious; you
have been doing a much better job in the clubs signing – in the club what items are in that coupon book. Has that done
anything to performance of the items in the book or, no, not really?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'd like to find out how you concluded that first.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Yeah.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. I think, look, we keep working it. It's a challenge. We've done it for a lot of years. I
think we've, first of all, gotten better at timing and such that they're easier to manage both by the buyers and having it
usually like a week in between them to give the warehouses time to move out what remnants are left from the old
MBM and being able to bring in the new stuff. Again, overall, every time you do an MBM you have more experience
about something that maybe has petered out a little bit, because we've been running it every year, or every six months,
and other things that did surprisingly well that perhaps even on a regional basis that we want to push everywhere. So, s
you might expect, we work with our vendors on that, figuring out how to best to spend that money to ultimately drive
sales.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Yeah, my comment was just that on the shelf itself, I'm seeing more – this item is in our
coupon book this month, which I hadn't seen going back a few months.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Fair enough. You're right on that.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I agree.

And your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi, good morning. Just had a few questions for you, first on inventory. You've seen inventory
tracking a decent amount above sales the last four quarters or so. The clubs look clean, at least the ones I visit. I'm just
curious what the driver is. Is it the new clubs? Is it dot-com? Maybe a little bit of color on that. And then also I know
you had an amazing turnout for job applications and staying curious what the early days are looking like in that club.
And then, finally, on the IT spending I imagine you probably have a pretty good idea of what that looks like for Q4, so
should we expect a similar set of 2 basis point incremental impact there?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Okay. Well, on inventories, the question related to where the increase is coming from?
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Yeah.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, clearly we have – yes, we do have more inventory in e-commerce because we're now
shipping out of more than one location. But that's relatively small to the total when I look at the total average per

location. Again, the big areas were a conscious effort on our part in Apparel. I mean one of, I think, our successes that
we've talked about for the last several quarters is massing out and making bigger commitments to some items that have
done – what I'll call fashion basics but everything from true basics to seasonal items like shorts and bathing suits and
KS items. We've done really well on some of those items. So we've certainly committed more inventory in that area. By
the way that area tends to be usually in the middle center area where we've shrunk some areas like media over the last
few years. What was the next question was?
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Just early days in Spain.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Oh. Well, Spain, I mean so far so good. We're only open for two weeks. We've had good
sign-ups. Not like Japan and Korea but very good in our mind. And we're pleased with the results so far in terms of
sales and it's growing. I mean you get small baskets when people come in for the first time. But we're pleased with the
results. I really don't want to be cute either way. It's so far so good.
And the last question related to IT. If you'd asked me before, I said minus two a couple weeks ago. I would say it's
probably minus 3 basis points just because it tends to be in the 3 basis points to 4 basis points range on average. It's
probably in the minus 2 basis points to minus 3 basis points range next quarter but we'll have to wait and see.
Starting near the end of the quarter and into Q1 of 2015 there'll be a couple of projects that go online and because you
capitalize those and then amortize them over, typically, a five-year period; sometimes a little less, sometimes a little
more, up to 7 basis points and generally no less than 3 basis points. But usually I'd say 5 basis points is a good single
point average. My guess is it'll tweak up a little bit again. And as I've said, our best guesstimate over a three or so year
period in terms of incremental impact to SG&A would be 10-plus basis points. And if we look now, I think this is about
the seventh fiscal quarter we've talked about it.
If I had a average, you look at all of fiscal 2013, those four numbers and annualize the three quarterly numbers this
year, we're probably in the 5 basis point to 7 basis point range incremental and we probably have another 3 basis points
or 4 basis points to go after that. So this is a guess and a decent estimate but we'll wait to see.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Great. Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Actually, my question's been asked already. Thank you.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot and good morning. Two questions, the first, Richard, relates to online. If you
could give us a sense as to what your members are asking for more of? It sounds like you're evolving the mix; are there
areas where you'd expect to grow the assortments incrementally based on member demand?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I mean, I think the areas that we've grown over the last years relative to prior to that
have been some limited apparel items, some health and beauty aid items and perhaps some other replenishable office
items. K-Cups, health and beauty aids, some small office needs. And as you probably are aware, for the first many
years many of our items were big ticket and in many cases deliverable, and in some cases White Glove installed items
like big screen TVs and patio furniture and swing sets and the like. And so certainly some of those – and furniture –
some of those are still our biggest categories for, one, they've been on for longer, and two, they're bigger-ticket items.
But we're, in our own way, looking to see how we can get items on there that are more regular and frequent and get
people to come to costco.com. And I think we're doing a little better with signage even in the warehouse of that certain
items, somebody doesn't want to necessarily have to schlep it home and install it. They're willing to pay for that

delivery, and certainly our prices are very attractive even on that basis.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: And as just a follow-up on that. As you think about the vintage of member that's doing
business online, is there a difference between those who've been Costco members for many years and maybe those who
are newer to the company?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, generally speaking, newer to the company means less purchases. Certainly when we
get a new sign-up online because they're buying online, I would say generally they tend to be lower. I don't have exact
numbers there. When we've looked at the age breakdown of our members, based on how long they've been members or
throughout the United States, and we look at new member sign-ups through a couple of these social media things that
we've done in recent months, it's what you'd expect it to be. You've got a younger member signing up through
LivingSocial and through zulily. And it's a relatively attractive cost of acquisition. So we're not going crazy here. We're
taking baby steps, but some of this stuff works.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: That's very helpful. Thank you so much.

And your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Hey. It's Jason DeRise here. I wanted to ask a question on the margin decision on some of the
food items that you sort of have a fixed price. I guess I just want to understand the rationale for not changing those.
And the comparison I want to make, whether it's fair or not, is that your fuel prices are not a fixed price and it varies
with what's happening in the market. So why not with rotisserie chicken and hot dogs and things like that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, well, that's like behind the black curtain here. Look, at the end of the day – first of
all, I want to make one other point about the previous question. As it relates to – well, I'll stop on that. Let's get to your
question first.
In terms of fixed items, I mean, in retail there are price points that are hot. I mean, the $1.50 hot dogs and soda. I think,
we didn't sit down one day and said, let's decide if the rotisserie chicken should be it. But as prices change dramatically
and we saw the competition raising the price, it was a hot price and let's take a little less margin, take a little less
margin, take a little or no margin. And so, I think there are a few examples of that extreme. Gas historically has always
been an item that, there's some locations where we comp shop the price three or four times a day compared to the
locations nearest us. So I mean, it tends – I think it's just the nature of retail and the nature of what we do. We don't sit
down and try to optimize everything. We're merchants, there are key price points, and that's how we do it.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Gas by the way is a lot more volatile, a lot more volatile and a – what, a $12 billion or $13
billion business for us. But it's very visual out there. I mean, people – if you go to some of these apps like
GasBuddy.com, there's a reason that we're comp shopping that item in some locations three or four times a day.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Okay. No, I know it's an unfair comparison but I thought – I don't know, just help try to
understand the thought process...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: ...between things like that. I guess as the follow-up on the last question, maybe it will get you
continue to follow up on the answer to the last question. But as you do these – as you try out social media or the
LivingSocial type promotions to get younger members to sign up, how do you manage with the limited number of
SKUs to keep both your core boomer shopper happy and then also have enough relevant items for a millennial
shopper? Or do you think that doesn't matter?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, we'll have to wait and see. We're not going to keep our head in the sand on it, but
extreme value works. And again to follow up on the previous question, what I was going to mention was the test that
we're doing with Google now in three major markets in the Bay Area, L.A. and New York City. Arguably those – if
you look at the age breakdown of those, it's younger. That's a positive. Now we're never – I don't think we're ever going
to get your one box of Life cereal, one box of Fruity Pebbles and two different types of half gallons of milk delivered to
your doorstep at 6:00 in the morning. But there's a lot of things we have. I mean, we've certainly changed, frankly
expanded the items out of the locations in the Bay Area. And you'll continue to see that. So we are excited to see what
the Instacarts and the [ph] Boxes (43:47) are doing as customers of ours. But they're small; they're new and there's
going to be a lot of things.
So I think there is still a lot of reasons. Not everybody wants to just sit home and type in stuff to have it delivered in the
morning. People like to go out and do stuff. We're pretty good at getting you in the warehouse. And we'll have to
evolve over time as well, but there are certain things in our model – there's a reason we're able to mark up goods on
average 11%. On average 11% on arguably buying power that's at the top of the heap in terms of strength. And that all
is good. We're open minded, but don't expect us to deliver to everybody's doorstep. If others want to, we'll be happy to
accommodate them and help them do that with our stuff.
I mentioned this last time and jokes aside, organic is getting bigger, not just for us, but for everybody. But again, just
like we wow people in our produce – members in our produce department, with great quality on slightly oversized
items for families, that whole organic thing is arguably – again, I don't think we sat down and strategically thought
about it. We look at what items work well and try some things, and when it works we really go after it. We've seen
surprisingly good success on organic, and produce, and fresh meat and fresh ground beef. And the challenge is the
supply frankly, there's not enough supply. But if we can show great value, we'll figure it out.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Okay, and actually that was what I was going to finish up on as an example of something for a
younger consumer base in the demographic. So you think that when you put these items on the shelf like organic
compared to conventional, you're getting enough rate of sale that all the economics from your point of view work; or if
it's not quite that level, you're willing to stick with it?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, the level of economics are still on an item basis. To the extent there's less
supply, we just don't put it in all the locations. And we'd love to have twice as much in some collocations. But items
live and die around here since the beginning of time, since 30 years ago. And certainly some of these organics are
really starting to take off. I think so far, one of the benefits that we think that we've had, I think I mentioned this before,
not only in some cases, I think I've used the like the fresh ground beef example in organic. It's a higher price point, we
get a slightly better or full margin, by our definition of full margin because it's not football every day out there at every
supermarket chain, and to our pleasant surprise, 75%, 80% of these sales of this new item was truly incremental. It was
existing members that didn't buy ground beef from Costco because they did buy organic. So it was incremental. And so
– now these are all small examples, but they're going to grow over time.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Great. Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, Richard, a couple questions. First, can you talk about the level of new member sign-ups
that you guys tend to see when you open up a club internationally versus what you see in the U.S.? I mean how
dramatic is that difference?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I don't have the exact numbers in front of us, but when we're in a well penetrated
very successful market like L.A., or parts of Virginia or New York, you might have – what we look at is during the 8
weeks to 12 weeks prior to opening when you've got parking lot partially done and there's tabling activities outside
where people come and signup, you might have as few as 3,000 or 4,000 new signups through those 8 weeks or 12

weeks. In a new small market like somewhere in the southeast like Louisiana, Baton Rouge or New Orleans or
Knoxville a couple years ago, you might have 8,000 to 12,000, because even though it's a much smaller market, it's
new.
We've had some extreme examples during those first many weeks prior to and through opening day, of 30,000 to
40,000 members in some of the Asia countries. It's somewhere in between there for Spain and Australia. So better than
the U.S., but again the benefit is when you open up in an L.A., Huntington Beach a few years ago or something like
that, you may have fewer net new signups but you're getting existing members that are going to shop more frequently
because they've got a unit 10 or 15 minutes from their home instead of 30 minutes.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, that's helpful. And then there was no gross margin headwind from the Executive
reward, 2% reward this quarter. What's happening in the spending patterns between your Executive members and your
regular Gold Star members? Are the Gold Star members kind of picking up incrementally? And just remind us where
you have the Executive Membership being offered and what countries you don't have it, and where you don't have it
what are your plans for getting it there? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Theoretically, our plan is to put it wherever we can and it makes sense. I don't know off the
top of my head where else it's going. Currently we have U.S. Canada, U.K. and Mexico. And I know we're looking at a
couple countries but I'm not going say when. My guess is in the next year or two, we'll have at least one more country.
Part of it, of course, is based on size and number of warehouses and number of members in that country. We want to
get a handful of offerings going, being able to go with the handful of offerings to start with.
I don't think the delta, one, as we've opened, there's probably a little more sales penetration in some of those new
markets, those new international markets where we don't have it. That probably impacted a little bit. I'm not terribly
concerned. It's generally been in the 1 basis point or 2 basis point delta year-over-year in terms of how that Reward
impacted it. This time is was a zero. I don't know off the top of my head. I haven't heard anything or seen anything at
the monthly budget meetings about any concern about that.
If anything, we're continuing – my one surprise yesterday or a couple days ago looking at these numbers was the fact
that we probably – the 25,000 or 26,000 new Executive members – new and converted Executive members per week
during the quarter is a little higher. Certainly a lot higher than Q2. I think a little higher on average than the last several
quarters on average. So we're still getting a lot of people to convert and that's good.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: That certainly looks like that trend continues to be healthy. So it looks like the Gold Stars are
definitely doing better. Last question, just early thinking on your openings for 2015. If there's not a number maybe just
kind of a geographic split how you are thinking kind of international versus the U.S., thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it will be similar to this year, 30, maybe hopefully 30 plus. I think I mentioned this
year, if we get to the 30, it's going to be 17 in the U.S. So a little more than half, I would guess half, 45% to 52% or
something next year, not 55%. But overall, we still think we've got opportunity in the U.S. and in Canada and other
markets that are seemingly well penetrated. We definitely have the pipeline more filled overseas now. So no, if I had to
guess, it will be a number north of 30 and south of 34.

And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Thanks, Richard. Thanks for taking my question. It's actually more of a big picture question
kind of going back to some of the e-commerce discussions and just noting that one of your biggest competitor's CEO is
on record yesterday saying that, if consumers just don't want stores, maybe we won't have stores, when talking about
kind of the trajectory here in the U.S. in e-commerce and whatnot. Now maybe that is because his stores aren't

performing as well as yours.
So I guess one of the things I'm wondering if you could say that Costco doesn't have as well developed of an
e-commerce platform. You could also say that a lot of stuff you guys carry Amazon has been pretty aggressive in, yet
your stores are doing great. Why do you think that is? What is the number one reason you think you are overcoming
maybe demographics, e-commerce, and really just putting up some of the best sales in retail?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well I think you mentioned some of them. It's merchandising. It's quality and quantity
relative to price. It's extreme value. Arguably, our demographic is probably – I don't think you need to be an economist
to understand that our demographic has probably been impacted less than the lower demographic retailers. Clearly, gas
brings you to the parking lot. Clearly, our fresh foods is a signature category. And fresh foods is something if you,
jokes aside, if you like our rotisserie chicken or our whole meal replacement items or any of those great fresh food
items or our organic produce it's a reason for you to come in and if you walk by and there are sweaters and the batteries
and the patio furniture and the active wear you're going to buy some more stuff.
So we think that again, delivering small quantities of stuff to home is not free. Ultimately somebody's got to pay for it.
And if we're going to lose sales over time to some of that, we'll figure out how to not lose as much and how to drive
sales in other ways. And I think we've been pretty good at that. But starting with an average markup of average gross
margin of 11%, which is – nobody comes close to that I think we'll be pretty good.
And but we're also open. We're as – without trying to put any fluff in it, we like the fact that it's been exciting to work
with a Google, to look at what opportunities to drive business and to drive business that might go somewhere else.
Some of these other new companies that are doing things and using us as part of that their platform to pickup and
deliver to members at a small cost, that's great.
So we'll keep figuring that out. But hopefully there's also some items that we only have. And usually that starts with
name Kirkland Signature. Or some crazy items that we only have that somebody bragged about that they can get at
Costco whether it's some incredible price on a branded handbag or bicycle or a kayak or whatever. So there's all kinds
of reasons to come into Costco.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And when you think about – that's a terrific answer. When you think about your own
e-commerce business, how do you prevent it from basically cannibalizing the heck out of your own stores? We've used
it before, but we've been using most of your e-commerce for like furniture, stuff I would never get at your warehouse.
How do you guys think about it as you grow this business and how it doesn't just cannibalize yourself and take your
ROICs down?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I get back to the question is if somebody's going to take that business, we'd rather
take it. We also recognize that, I'll call it the good old days, when there was no such thing as the Internet. You only had
one choice and if you wanted to get that TV or that patio furniture for that price you either find a friend with a pickup
truck or go get a U-Haul and get it home.
You have choices now. And so we do believe that we're selling some of those items that would not have been bought in
store. Not everybody's going to take those big ticket items home that way. So we have to change with the times there.
But we also recognize we also have to get you in on a, hopefully, increasingly frequent basis so you pass by all those
items that you go wow. And I think so far we've done pretty well with that.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Indeed. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Right.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: ... is that right? If you [ph] chip (57:08) about 3% per club?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Could you help us understand what's driving that 3% per club? Is it that Executive Membership
shift? Is it international? What's the bulk of that up 3% per club?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Executive Membership is a good chunk of it. On an international basis, again, I'd have to
analyze it a little more. There's more sign-ups per location although in some countries converted into dollars, it's a little
less than 55. And of course we don't have 110 in some of those countries. So I think it's probably the fact that we do get
more sign-ups internationally is probably the biggest reason.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: But you think Executive is still a bigger portion of that than international if you had to
[indiscernible] (58:01) follow?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: If I had to guess I'd probably say half-and-half. I just don't know.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. And given the renewals internationally continue to improve, is
there a threshold or how should we think about raising the fee in markets outside the U.S., given that we know how it
works in the U.S., the five to six-year pattern? How should we think about either a threshold or renewal rates or
members per club where we start to model that in the international side?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know. I mean we don't talk about it a lot. We like the fact that in new markets, and
recognizing these new markets are also much smaller percentages of our total company, let's work to just drive business
and drive sign-ups. And we can worry about all of that later. And so we look at it every year or so but spend all of
about 10 minutes looking at it, and we'll see in the future. I mean it. I don't see any current plans that make any major
changes out there.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: So fair to say the focus internationally is still getting the sign-ups rather than trying to take the
fee up?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes. I think that's not even on page one of a 25-line page. The first order of business is
opening units and getting them to work right. And even in very successful countries and even with the support of its
parents in the U.S., us, when you're going from nine to now 20 units in Japan over to a little over two years, and going
from three to six locations in Australia in a little over a year and a half, there's challenges. Nothing major, and believe
me, I think we have some – every week there's somebody from one of my departments going over to help out on
something somewhere, which is good. But at the same time you always have some growing pains with that kind of
stuff.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Great. And then a little bit of a housekeeping; I think on the SG&A you mentioned workers'
comp hurt 3 basis points. Is that...?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Actually, benefit to workers' comp. I think workers' comp was actually flat to a very slight
improvement year-over-year as a percent.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Benefits was the bigger culprit.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Benefits was the culprit; workers' comp helped. Was there anything – so that was a net figure,
the 3 basis points, was benefits and workers' comp?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it was like 4 basis points and 1 basis point, plus 4 basis points and minus 1 basis
point. But benefits and workers' comp, we always summarize together.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it and that benefits trend looks like it's an ongoing thing as opposed to anything that...?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, the one thing that helps it, I mean, we read about hospital costs are becoming less
inflationary in the U.S. And I talked to a few other different types of companies at a recent meeting outside of Costco
and we're not seeing the lows, low numbers. I think maybe on a per-charge at a given hospital or a given doctor, some
things might be lower if it's only through the Medicare system as an example. But some of the things that have been
added, like the up to 26-year-old instead of 18 years to 22 years based on if your kid's in college or not, your
dependents, on mental and medical health parity; on no limits. All these things have added 1 percentage point and 1.5
percentage points to an already large number.
The thing that's, frankly, going to help us more than that whether inflation is 5% or 10% or 3%, certainly if it comes
down into lower single digits that's a positive for us. But the bigger thing is the increasing penetration outside of the
United States, where health care costs as a percent of sales, respect to sales in that country, is a lot less.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it. And then lastly on the gross margin, I think last quarter you talked about some of the
gross margin, about half of the hurt was self-inflicted or something you decided to do. It sounds like this was a quarter
where you felt that you didn't need to decide to do that again. Am I summarizing that correctly?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, again, I used the extreme example of the chicken. Again, we went from two years of
an item that arguably represents several hundred million in sales, of having very little if any margin, to indicating that
as underlying costs have come down a little, we didn't change the price but we improved the margin a little bit. It's one
item but it's one item that probably impacted us incrementally by 3 or more basis points over the last couple of years
and it's now helping, and some of that's reversing. Not all of it. And again, a little increasing penetration overseas helps
you a little bit.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. All right. Thanks, Richard.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We don't try to get lower margin. We try to get lower prices, but we still look to see where
we can get a little.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. Thanks.

And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: Good morning, Richard. If we're looking at what proteins are doing, especially some of
the strong inflation we're seeing in certain categories, how are you seeing your members switching between those? And
what is that doing to your gross profit margin in the edible protein category?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think from the last budget meeting there was some switch from beef to poultry, as you
might expect with the rising prices with beef. I don't have an exact number. When I look at overall fresh foods margins,
again – yeah, pounds like on beef are a little down but dollars are up because of the price. I don't know off the top of
my head, Chuck, that detail.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: All right. And then just a quick follow-up with regards to Spain, anything worth
pointing out there with regard to the product mix as you open up that's unique to Spain?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: In the pictures that I saw, there were certainly some unique local items to Spain and
Europe, but generally speaking many of the pictures that I saw looked a lot like a Costco that you would see. As you
might expect like any opening and certainly like a new opening in a new country, there are probably a lot of hot
nonfood items where we were able to procure merchandise and really show great values of exciting stuff. But I'm
shooting from the hip with this answer.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: Got you. We both need to get over there.

And your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thanks. Couple quick model questions. So by the nature of the LIFO calculation, you had a
7 basis point benefit last year in the fourth quarter. Just by the fact that you have a benefit, does that end up being a
negative this year in the fourth quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. That negative related to how it was versus the year before that. But we now start with
that base of cost if you will a year ago, really start with the basis at the beginning of this fiscal year. And so how do
prices trend, again using an index of 100.00 at the beginning of – times zero at the beginning of fiscal year and let's say
through the end of the third quarter I mentioned as an example what I'll call the food and sundries pool, or what we call
a foods pool, which is canned goods and cereals and things like that, from the beginning of the fiscal year it was up
2.6%. It may go up or down a little in Q4 from that 102.6% number. It might be – if it went down 0.10% there'd be a
LIFO credit in the quarter even though that was a small offset to the big LIFO charge year to date through the first third
quarters.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: I understand.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: So it's really – if you think about it, what's going happen in Q4 is what the index was for
all the pools at Q3 end and what it will be 16 weeks end.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: But you mentioned that it was – I understand, so sequential. You also mentioned that price
has accelerated in the back half of the quarter, so it sounds like it's more likely to be a negative.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It could be, but – it probably will, be but I just don't know.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay. And then on the buybacks, you bought back 1.6 million shares. The share count
ticked down 0.1 sequentially. So just curious, was that more based on the timing of the buyback during the quarter or
was that – was there more of a big impact from the stock option exercising?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, there's not a whole lot of stock option exercises. In fact using in a treasury stock
method that's kind of implicit in the number anyway for options. If you have a big in-the-money option, which are
remaining small amount of options that were granted in 2005 I believe, so they expire in 2015. 2004 and 2005 so they
expire this year and next year. We're down to very few left. But if you had a – making the math simple, if you had a
$40 exercise price on $120 stock price, for every option out there you'd exercise three of them and then buy one share
back, so there'd be a net increase of two shares. So that kind of number is not a big number. We've bought stock during
the quarter relatively speaking proportional during the course of the period.
So if it was 1.6 million shares, my guess is that the rough subtraction to the total shares outstanding would be about half
that number, about 800,000. We said the calculation only went down 100,000. It would be some additional vesting
since then on RSUs, and to a very, very small extent the extent the stock price was a little higher versus a quarter ago,
and I don't know if it was or if it wasn't, that would maybe impact it a very shade. But the big things would be roughly
adding 800 and then subtracting – I mean subtracting 800 then adding some due to the – just ongoing vesting of
previous grants.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: I got you. And then last quarter you talked about your intent to buy back more stock. Any
thoughts on going forward here?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Other than what we've started, again I don't want to be cute or coy. We continue to buy a
little, but we're not suggesting that. I mean, if you took the exact – those nine weeks times those shares, I think you get
to a number in the $900 million a year range? I don't know if it will be less or more than that next quarter on an

annualized basis, but it could be a little less. We'll just see. It probably is either a little less or a little more, but not a
whole lot different. But we'll see.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay. And then last one just in terms of you had the Spain pressure on the pre-open. As you
look forward is sort of pre-open per store normalized back down to levels that we've seen historically?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Say that again. I'm sorry?
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: The pre-open, if I look at pre-opening expense, it ticked up partly because of Spain. As you
look going forward, does the pre-opening dollars per store go back down to more normalized levels?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, generally, because it was clearly skewed because of Spain. To the extent that we
opened more international, they tend to be a little higher. But assuming we open France next year, again we don't know
when that will happen, there'll be another little tick upward in that quarter.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Understood. Thanks very much.

And your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt Siler>: Hey, guys. It's actually Matt for Paul. A lot of our questions have been answered, but I was just
curious on online with some of the new countries you're entering, you have a different plan in terms of a rollout of your
online platform relative to the stores than you've kind of done historically? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I know we're looking at other countries to open in, countries where we operate. But I
don't know if there's any – we haven't stated anything about when.
