Dion J. Weisler
Thank you, Diana, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with our second
quarter results. We did what we set out to do. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.41 above our
previously provided outlook range. Free cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion. We took action to improve our cash
conversion cycle and are on track to deliver our full year outlook. And we returned more than $0.5 billion of capital to
shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
Amidst difficult market conditions, net revenue was in line with our expectations, down 11% year-over-year as
reported or down 5% in constant currency. And in APJ, for the second quarter in a row, we delivered constant currency
revenue growth with strength in Personal Systems across much of the region. I will not be completely satisfied with
company performance until we return to sustained growth. Delivering our financial commitments is evidence of the
solid progress we're make against our strategy to protect our core, deliver on growth and invest in our future.
Let me take a moment to remind you of our objectives when we started the year. First, we said the markets were going
be tough for at least several quarters. We are on track to reduce our cost structure by more than $1 billion in FY 16
through productivity initiatives and an acceleration of our three-year restructuring plan into this year. We executed a
number of cost actions, including a reduction of approximately 1,200 head count year-to-date and are on track to
achieve our savings objective by year-end. I continue to believe we have even more opportunity.
Second, we said we would be rational in how we price in our core competitive markets. In Q2, we achieved another
quarter of sequential ASP improvement in print hardware. While these actions did pressure hardware unit placement,
we are starting to see more rational pricing in the market.
Third, we said we would continue to shift our portfolio towards strategic and future growth areas. Year-over-year in
Q2, we had constant currency growth in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, commercial services, Managed
Print Services, and graphics printing solutions. And we just launched our first 3D systems, which I will cover shortly.
A key to success in competitive markets is product differentiation and innovation. It's thrilling to see the innovation
coming out of HP supporting our core growth and future initiatives. We are reinventing our business and our
technologies so that industries and individuals can reinvent what matters most.
Let me share some examples of incredible innovation this quarter. We launched a robust business printing lineup with
more than 15 new PageWide, Officejet Pro and JetIntelligence LaserJet printers. This launch included an incredible
innovation in productivity and supported our objective to reshape the install base towards units with higher supplies
usage.
As the industry continues to shift from transactional to contractual sales, HP and our partners are differentiated with our
secure Managed Print Services offering. At a time when security is essential to customers, HP has the strongest security
protection available in the industry. In our graphics business, drupa, the Olympics of graphics, is just one week away
and we are planning several exciting announcements. Among others, we are expanding our packaging portfolio to
address customer needs as they shift to digital and we are enhancing our commercial graphics printers with image
quality and productivity simply unmatched in the industry.

And just last week, we delivered the world's first production-ready commercial 3D printing system, marking a major
step forward towards igniting what could be the next industrial revolution. I'm really proud of this announcement,
which we made with some significant ecosystem partners, including Nike, BMW, Johnson & Johnson, and Siemens
among others.
The new HP Jet Fusion 3D printing solutions produced superior physical parts up to 10 times faster and at half the cost
of current 3D printing systems. Our products deliver the speed, cost and quality and economics that will help
democratize manufacturing and help deliver mass customization. These systems leveraged decades of HP's R&D print
expertise and thousands of patents from our core. We are building a whole new partner channel for 3D printing and
we'll continue to grow our ecosystem of co-development and technology partners in powerful industries like
automotive, aerospace, medical and consumer goods.
In Personal Systems, we continued to deliver design and engineering in the consumer premium segment, including our
most recent announcements of the HP Spectre, the world's thinnest laptop. We introduced this beautiful product at the
New York Times Luxury Show in Paris to rave reviews. We grew double digits year-over-year in this profitable
segment while the broader consumer premium market declined.
Among other highlights in Personal Systems, we reinvented the Chromebook to be ultra-thin for home and office and
announced it with Google earlier in April. Commanding a higher selling price, this modern, thin and light device offers
quick boot time, simple navigation and syncing, multi-layered security and the ability to share and access information
anywhere. It's also the first to use the sixth generation Intel Core M processor. With our superior product lineup, we
continue to grow our reputation and competitive position. Some of our major logo wins include Eli Lilly, GM and
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
I'll shift now to provide color on the segment results. In Personal Systems, we executed well against a challenging
market backdrop. We continue to make progress on our strategy to deliver profitable share gains while gaining
momentum in key growth markets.
In the core we outperformed the PC market once again. We extended our worldwide commercial leadership to a new
all-time high share position of 24.6% with meaningful year-over-year share gains in all three regions. We maintained
our number one share position in worldwide desktop workstations at 45.6% and grew our number one share in mobile
workstations to 38.9%.
And beyond the core, we delivered constant currency year-over-year growth in strategic areas such as detachables,
commercial services and consumer displays, all very profitable businesses. Personal Systems operating profit improved
to 3.5% with year-over-year growth in operating profit dollars. A key commercial customer win came with Deutsche
Post DHL Group, the world's leading logistics service group. The deal included a broad range of commercial products
including EliteBooks, x2 tablets, Chromebooks and displays.
Now turning to Printing, in line with our expectations, the year-over-year revenue decline continued but was
approximately flat sequentially. In addition to demand weakness, we faced currency headwinds of about 6 points
year-over-year. We said we needed to focus on operational improvements in the core business to support stability in
supplies revenue, and in Q2, all elements of the supplies Four Box Model performed largely as expected.
Specifically, on hardware units, we pulled back on discounts. This resulted in an increase in constant currency ASPs
both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And as I mentioned earlier, those actions did pressure total unit sales.
However, our cost actions enabled us to place additional positive NPV units. As a result, we grew 2 points of share
sequentially in calendar first quarter in both ink and laser hardware.
As I said always say, not all hardware is created equally. The quality of the install base is important. Over time, we are
working to shift the install base to units with higher supplies usage. We saw double-digit unit growth in PageWide print
hardware while gaining share in value multifunction laser printers.
Also, we continued to execute on our initiatives to win back aftermarket supply share. We've started to see progress and
expect continued momentum in the coming quarters. Instant Ink, our subscription-based delivery service, had another

quarter of sequential enrollee growth and high retention rates.
Let me also highlight that we made this progress while reducing hardware and supplies channel inventory globally. We
are now within our targeted ranges. And given our progress, we still expect our supplies revenue trajectory in constant
currency to stabilize by the end of 2017.
Beyond the core, we had solid momentum in our growth categories. In graphics, we delivered the 11th consecutive
quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth supported by strength in large format design, production and
services. A terrific win was with Staples where we supported their entire graphics solutions business with technologies
ranging from DesignJet graphics to Latex to Scitex flatbed systems. This is another major expansion of the graphics
wide format relationship and symbolic of our leadership in service delivery.
Before I turn it over to Cathie, I want to reinforce that this was a strong quarter for HP where we delivered solid
progress towards our strategy in the core, growth and future markets. Despite a tough market, we delivered on our
objectives, unleashed truly amazing innovations, and grew in strategic areas of our business. I am confident in our
ability to execute and remain committed to long-term growth.
I'll now hand it over to Cathie who will share additional details including our financial outlook.
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thanks, Dion. Q2 results were solid and in line operationally with our expectations. Net revenue was $11.6 billion,
down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant-currency. Gross margin of 19.4% was down 0.3 points
year-over-year driven by unfavorable currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by cost improvements and
favorable mix. Gross margin was up 0.7 points quarter-over-quarter, largely in line with normal seasonality.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.3 billion were down 16% year-over-year primarily in SG&A. As a reminder, due
to the use of discontinued operations basis of accounting, some historical expenses primarily in admin were fully
allocated to the parent company, which was HP, Inc. in the U.S. Also, in Q2 2016, we recorded a gain in SG&A from
the sale of certain marketing optimization software assets. Further, we had year-over-year savings from reduction in our
overall cost structure.
Non-GAAP OI&E was a net expense of $13 million, lower than normal run rate due to a one-time benefit from a legal
settlement benefiting net EPS by about $0.03. Although timing was unknown when we set our FY 2016 annual
financial plan, the settlement was modeled in our full year earnings outlook and was fully booked in Q2.
With a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered
non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41. GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of
$0.38 primarily excluded restructuring charges of $100 million, only partially offset by non-operating
retirement-related credits of $40 million.
Non-GAAP results also excluded an $8 million net tax indemnification credit related to the tax matters agreement with
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effects will
continue to change each quarter and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results.
Now turning to the segments, Personal Systems net revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-over-year or down 5% in
constant-currency. Consumer revenue was down 16%, while commercial revenue was down 7% year-over-year as
reported. While we outperformed the market overall, we did especially well in the commercial segment with
improvement in the year-over-year revenue decline.
Innovations across the portfolio have been well-received by customers. We are very excited about the great momentum
of the Elite X2 commercial mobility product which had solid initial sales and has a very strong sales pipeline. As a
result of our focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant-currency year-over-year revenue in
commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, consumer premium and gaming.

Personal Systems' ASPs were down slightly year-over-year, but improved sequentially due to favorable mix partially
offset by highly competitive pricing. Personal Systems' operating profit was 3.5%, up 0.6 points year-over-year driven
by improved gross margin rate. Also, we reduced operating expenses as compared to last year but not in line with
revenue declines.
Turning to Printing, net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 16% year-over-year or down 10% in constant-currency.
Hardware units were down slightly sequentially but better-than-normal seasonality as our cost actions increased the
number of units that we're now at a positive NPV. Approximately 11 points of the 16% year-over-year unit decline
were related to the market. The remainder was largely associated with our pricing discipline and focus on only positive
NPV unit placement. We are very pleased with our refreshed product portfolio which will support our hardware
strategy to price on differentiated value and to ensure strong HP original supplies attach.
Supplies revenue was down 16% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant-currency. Considering currency
and the channel inventory position, the supplies revenue trajectory has improved. We reduced channel inventory in the
quarter which was a seven-point headwind as compared to the prior-year period. In Q2, Supplies revenue mix was
67%, flat sequentially and channel inventory was within our targeted range.
Operating profit for Printing was 17.3%, down 0.5 points year-over-year driven by currency and competitive pricing,
partially offset by operational improvements, favorable hardware mix and divestiture gains. The gain from the sale of
certain marketing optimization software assets helped to offset the incremental placement of hardware units and the
reduction of supplies inventory in the quarter.
Now to an update on the restructuring activities we announced at our Security Analyst Meeting last fall. Over 800
people exited the company in Q2 and approximately 1200 year-to-date. The acceleration of the restructuring activities
is on track and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the year. As Dion said, we are
continuously seeking efficiencies and we believe there are incremental actions to take beyond this fiscal year.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocations, cash flow from operations was approximately $1.6 billion and free cash
flow was approximately $1.5 billion. The cash conversion cycle was negative 24 days, a nine-day sequential
improvement driven by a six-day increase in days payable outstanding and a three-day decrease in days of inventory.
I'm extremely pleased with the operational rigor of the entire organization and all the working capital metrics.
We still expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow to be the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Our expected
seasonality would suggest Q4 to be a stronger cash flow quarter than Q3. During the second quarter, we repurchased
28.7 million shares and paid $213 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $518 million. Given
where we are year-to-date, we will clearly achieve and may exceed the high end of our original 50% to 75% target
range of returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full year.
Look ahead there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect
year-over-year revenue declines to moderate for Personal Systems and Printing. Also in Printing, the progress we are
making on cost structure as well as some price discipline gives us the opportunity to place more units.
Hardware unit declines we'll moderate, although we still expect low double digit declines year-over-year. Supplies
revenue in constant currency will continue to decline but is still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. Productivity
initiatives and accelerated restructuring actions across the company are expected to improve overall profitability as
compared to the first half of the year.
With all that in mind, Q3 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. Q3 2016
GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Our full year fiscal
2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.59 to $1.65. Our full year fiscal 2016 GAAP
diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.52 to $1.58.
With that, let's open it up for questions.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Katy Huberty at
Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Yes, thanks. Cathie, how should we think about the yen influence on printing margins
through the remainder of the year?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So thanks, Shannon. From the yen benefit perspective, we do expect a little bit of a
benefit. We saw a little bit in Q2 as well, but that benefit is significantly coming down as the yen has appreciated a bit.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: And then as you think about PCs in the back half, maybe Dion, we're hearing from
distributors that inventories have come down. You seem to cite that as well. Would you expect any meaningful
improvement in unit growth as we go into the back half of the year?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: And, Katy, was that for printing or personal systems?
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: For PCs.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: For PCs, I would say that we have consistently remained very vigilant in our control over
inventory. I think it's a mixed bag in terms of inventory out in the channel. There are some vendors that still have
higher levels of inventory and some where inventory has come down. I think all of it points to, sort of broadly
speaking, we don't largely disagree with what the major analysts are predicting for the second half of the year that
whilst the markets will continue to be pressured, it will abate somewhat in the second half of the year. Our inventory is
well in control and so is our aged inventory too. Very important metrics that we watch very closely.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And, Katy, sorry about that. I'm so used to Shannon asking the questions [indiscernible]
(23:14).
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: It's okay.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I went immediately to Shannon. I apologize.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: It's okay.
<A - Diana Sroka>: Okay. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall at JPMorgan.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Thanks for taking the question. So my question, I guess it's along similar lines but broader, that
you guys have such a broad impact and kind of an outsized impact from currency, especially from the strong dollar.
And it looks like the interest rate, most people are expecting [indiscernible] (23:47). How stress-tested is your earnings
guidance for the full year against a stronger dollar? What sort of assumptions are you making? Could you just give us
some idea on that?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Well, Rod, if you actually look at where currencies are today, they're not that different
than where we started the beginning of the year when we provided our first outlook. On top of that, we obviously put
hedges in over time. And so we feel pretty confident in our outlook given where the dollar is now even if it were to get
a little bit stronger.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Okay. So you assume a little bit of an interest rate rise, but not much more than that, Cathie? Is
that correct?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So I look at it more from currency perspective. I understand it's the interest rate rise
drives the currency. So we look at it more and we've modeled the different levels of the dollar.

<Q - Rod B. Hall>: And can I ask you one follow-up, which is your interest expense was quite a bit lower than last
quarter. I just wonder if you can give us any color on what drove that?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. The biggest difference wasn't interest rates. It was this legal settlement that we had
that benefited EPS by about $0.03. That showed primarily up in OI&E.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Diana Sroka>: Thank you. Next question?
Operator
The next question is from James Kisner at Jefferies LLC.
<Q - James Kisner>: Yes. Thank you. I just want to clarify your comments on supplies. I believe you said that while
the decline was worse year-over-year, it had a pretty significant headwind from inventory adjustments. And I'm just
kind of wondering if you could talk about how that impact from inventory affected last quarter's constant currency
growth and just in general what kind of market decline you are modeling for supplies, or assuming for the supplies
market to stabilize the revenue by the end of 2017?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So I think the way to think about this is probably to go back to the Four Box Model and
how we think about supplies in terms of us being on the trajectory that leads to stabilization in constant currency
supplies revenue by the end of 2017. And I believe Dion said it in his prepared remarks that when we started the
quarter we have an expectation of what the Four Box – the different elements of the Four Box Model are going to do,
based on the models that we have. And then we look at the end of the quarter to see how they responded in actuality.
And they were largely in line with what we were expecting. And that says that our model is predicting in the quarter,
within a quarter, is doing a good job of predicting what's going to happen to supplies. So we are on track with that.
In terms of the channel inventory correction, off the top of my head, I don't remember what the impact was last quarter.
We did have some – we definitely had some channel inventory corrections last quarter as well, but this quarter was
larger and it was seven points of the headwind. So if you look at the, if look at this, you look at supplies growth of – or
decline of about 16%. You take off about six points of currency, seven points of channel inventory, if you look at kind
of the real demand, it's basically down about 3%, again, in line with what we were expecting.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: And just to give you my perspective on this, what I'm most happy about is we did exactly what
we said we would do. And what has happened in the market and what we thought happened in the market has actually
transpired. We said we needed to adjust to what I call the new normal and that was sort of a combination of further
market contraction that was driving an increased competitive price market. We said that way saw weakness in
emerging markets and we did indeed see that continue, currency continued as a headwind and that we were expecting
tough macroeconomic conditions worldwide. We actually adapted to this new normal.
And you'll remember, on our fourth quarter earning call and our first quarter earning call, we talked about having to not
only deliver on the $1 billion of productivity improvements, but actually that wasn't going be enough and that we were
going to need do more. And we are on track to doing more than that our $1 billion. We also said that we needed to
accelerate our restructuring, and in Cathie's prepared remarks, she said we were also on track to doing that and that we
needed to persist with our efforts to drive price stability in the market. So all of that is actually working.
Our supplies trajectory improved, but it was somewhat masked by the channel inventory reductions that we had.
Supplies inventory is now back within the ranges globally and that's obviously where we want it to be. So we, with all
of those productivity improvements, continue to reshape the install base. We're focusing on high value units. That's
evidenced through the continued growth in value multi-function laser. We said we needed to continue to refresh the
product lineup. We did that. 15 new devices launched last quarter. JetIntelligence, PageWide Array and Officejet Pro.
And we said we needed to continue to grow in our graphics business and we did for the eleventh consecutive quarter in
a row as we did with Instant Ink.

So as Cathie mentioned, all of that translates to what we're seeing transpire as we planned it out to be. And therefore,
with all of that we expect to stabilize our supplies revenue trajectory by the end of 2017.
<Q - James Kisner>: Quick follow-up on that. I mean, it sounds like you're on track from your restructuring and from
supplies growth long term. So I guess wondering why you're lowering the higher end of guidance here? Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Yes. So what happened in Q2, and what we are expecting will be true in Q3 and Q4 as
well, is that with the cost reductions that we've made, we actually have, in effect, opened up more positive NPV TAM
in printer units. So we took advantage of that in Q2. And we gained two points of share sequentially while maintaining
our price rationally. And we expect that in back half of the year we will also be able to take advantage of placing
additional units which is, from my perspective and Dion's perspective, the right thing do for the business, to maximize
the area under the curve. And so that took the top end of our previous guidance down a bit, but for the long-term value
for the company.

The next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Adrienne Colby>: Hi. It's Adrienne Colby for Sherri. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could
update us on your expectations for the cash conversion cycle? You obviously saw some impressive improvement, but
how should we think about working capital over the balance of the year?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Well, let me just say that I was very pleased with the improvements in each of the cash
conversion metrics that we closely track and monitor. Our goal was, as you remember, to reduce our cash conversion
cycle by several days from our quarter one exit. We got there plus a little bit more. And this was an, actually, an
enormous enterprise-wide effort. And we've made some permanent changes to our processes and to our business
management system. I think the team rallied exceptionally well together to focus on all the levers that we have
available us to.
So we expect to exit FY 2016 with cash conversion cycle several days improved over FY 2015. And that will enable us
to achieve our full year free cash flow outlook of 2.3 billion to 2.6 billion for the full year.

Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi at Bernstein.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. Cathie, you talked about the legal gain helping $0.03. You also mentioned
that there was a gain on sales of marketing optimization software. How big was that? And was that completely captured
in the imaging, printing and imaging group? And I have a follow-up.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Yes, Toni. It was completely captured within the printing OP. And while we're not
specifically sizing it, I think what we did was we used that opportunity to fund the incremental unit placements that we
had as a result of cost reductions that we've done. We placed more units. We we're able to gain that share I mentioned.
And then we also – we took our supplies channel inventory levels down even a bit further than what we had originally
intended because we believed that managing – having a tight handle on the channel inventory levels is good for our
business.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: Okay. And just a follow-up. I mean, it sounds like you're saying you're going to invest in
trying to take more share yet you also said to expect double-digit declines in units for the remainder of the year. And I

know I probably asked some form of this question every call, but 100% of your profits are driven by supplies. And
your assertion that supplies should stabilize next year is still not transparent to me.
And so if we look at the last five quarters, hardware revenue has been down double-digits. Hardware revenue has been
down 19 out of the last 20 quarters. So if I'm looking at that box in the Four Box Model that says what's happening to
my install base, it's down, and it's probably down mid-single digits. So to stabilize, what's to keeping the changes? Are
you expecting much better capture rate on reman? Are you expecting people to start printing more, given their printers?
But the only thing that we really see is what's happening to your install base, and that's declining. So I appreciate that
your model tells you and it's been accurate, but it would be really helpful if we could understand what you think
happens in the model to go from what's been closer to mid single-digit declines in supplies to zero given the backdrop
that we see, which is hardware units continues to be negative.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, Toni, really what I said was that the printer unit declines would be low double digits
in Q3. Q3 is a relatively tough compare because if you'll remember last year, we did some incremental what we called
insurance policy because of the split that we were going through, so it is a tough compare. But we went from minus
20% declines in Q1 to minus 16%, and then it's going to come down further as well in Q3 of 2016. And I think what's
important is that we've captured – it's not like this is a surprise to us. We've captured it within the modeling that we
have done. Our models are holding up, and our models basically show that supplies revenue in constant currency will
stabilize by the end of 2017.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: And I think, Toni, what you're really highlighting here is the complexity of the business, and
there is no single magic pill that changes the supplies trajectory. So what we need do is to continue to focus on all areas
of the Four Box Model, the install base being one metric. But remember that the install base is a function of every kind
of category and segment of business that we do, from those printers that produce less supplies to those that produce a
lot of supplies.
And we are placing more NPV-positive units enabled by the costs that we're taking out of the business and we're
innovating and we're introducing new products and new series of printers that are really very much focused on the
business side of the ledger. And these new platforms generally come with higher supplies attach because the
aftermarket alternatives have not yet made their way into the market.
Usage is another part of the Four Box Model. Not all printers are created equally, and even the same printer placed in a
different location or a different ZIP code produce a different amount of supply. So reshaping that install base to
high-usage printers is kind of job number one. The other major shift that's happening is the move from transactional to
contractual, and as that shift happens, we move to 100% supplies attach.
And the final area in terms of usage is the work we're doing around marketing to stimulate printing demand. We're
shifting our marketing efforts from marketing printers to marketing printing, and that takes care of box number two.
On the third box, the aftermarket share, you have these newer platforms that come with higher attach. You've got work
we're doing around the omni-channel. It's very comprehensive, covering online coverage in marketing as well as the
innovation that we're driving in our ink formulas and new toner technology resulting in a much better printed page
when you're using original HP supplies.
And the fourth lever, of course, is pricing, which remains flat and consistent with our expectations. So all these factors
drive supplies consumption, not just the install base. And the model would suggest that we are on track to that
stabilization by the end of 2017 in constant-currency.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And we have initiatives in every one of those boxes.
<A - Diana Sroka>: Thank you, Toni. Next question, please.

The next question is from Wamsi Mohan at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: Yes, thanks. Dion, you mentioned more rational pricing. How much do you attribute to the
recent moves in the yen? Are you seeing any difference in the competitive behavior? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Well, I think it's a little hard to speculate because I don't necessarily understand the hedging
strategies of each of our Japanese competitors. I would say in the long term, if the yen remains where it is, that
ultimately is good news for us. But I think we're being very disciplined in the market in terms of not dragging the
market down in price, selling the value of our products, shifting away from spending contra dollars on discounting to
marketing and sales, and that's resulted in higher ASPs. So we're very focused on our activities. And I think we're
starting to see some signs of market stabilization.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: Okay. Great. And as my follow-up, it sounds like you regained some share in the aftermarket
supplies. Can you talk about where that was, how much it was, whether it was commercial or consumer and was it like
related primarily to the new printer introductions in the quarter? Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So I don't believe that we've made any statements specifically about aftermarket share for
supplies improving. Now, we are, as part of going after the Four Box Model, we are working on increasing our
aftermarket supply share. And we're starting to make some progress specifically in the omni-channel space which is
what Dion mentioned, I believe, in his prepared remarks.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: So I think I would expect that aftermarket share would come up as we release these newer
platforms. Those newer platforms come with almost 100% supplies attach. I would expect our aftermarket share as we
move from transactional to contractual, where that comes with 100% supplies attach to drive up our aftermarket share. I
would expect the work we're doing around omni-channel, as Cathie mentioned, which is some very comprehensive
work around online coverage and marketing to also improve our aftermarket share and the innovation that we're driving
in ink formulas and toner would also do that.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: Great. Thank you.

The next question is from Maynard Um at Wells Fargo.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi. I just have question that looks at it a little bit further. You have a number of drivers in
2017, including 3D printing, the A3 market, a number of other new products. But can you help us identify what the
mile markers are to judge success? I mean, what should we be looking for as we enter 2017 that points us to these
materializing as growth drivers for you? And how long does it take for these products to ramp to a level that's material
enough that it can actually have an impact on revenue and profit? Is it two, three quarters? Thanks.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Thanks, Maynard. So let me say that everything that we've spoken about so far has really been
focused on the core and we're really incredibly focused on our traditional franchises of Printing and Personal Systems.
But as part of our overall strategy for the company, we do have certain growth areas that are incredibly important to us.
You mentioned a couple of them. Our A3 product work remains on track and our portfolio will come out towards the
middle of next year. That is on time and on track, and we're doing a lot of work around preparing not only for the
products, but for the go-to-market that is required in order to be successful in this marketplace.
Another part of our growth engine is graphics. Graphics grew for the 11th consecutive quarter. We're just about to walk
into drupa next week, which is the Olympics of the graphics business. It happens every four years and we're very
excited about some of the products that we will be announcing at drupa.
And the third area is commercial mobility, and our commercial mobility practice continues to grow. We're excited by
the work we're doing there. We made some really interesting category creating product announcements with the Elite

x3 during the course of the quarter at Mobile World Congress to rave reviews. So lots of positive signals in the market
from a product perspective and the pipeline that we're building.
Then of course, only last week we announced our 3D printing products. And we have really breakthrough innovation
here, solving the problems of speed, quality and cost. We said we would release them in the second half of this year
and a proof point of that is the announcements that we made last week, and the strategic announcements that we made
with Nike, with BMW, with Johnson & Johnson, and Jabil, a very important player in this space. So I think there's a lot
of markers out there that point to the execution of this team. We do what we say we're going to do, whether it's product,
whether it's go-to-market or business model readiness.

The next question is from Jim Suva at Citigroup.
<Q - James Dickey Suva>: Thank you, and congratulations to you and your team there at HP. I have one question for
Dion and one for Cathie, so I'll just ask them both at the same time. First, for Dion, your sister company, HP Enterprise,
last night announced that they'd break out part of their business, namely the Services. Have you considered splitting up
or would you? And does that actually make any sense?
And then for Cathie, the operating profit margins in Printing, I believe, was down year-over-year and I think you'd
mentioned the litigation helped that. So would have been down even more year-over-year. Is that the correct way to
think about it is to stabilize it? Is it top line? Is it mix? Is it cost cutting? And how should we think about stabilizing the
operating margins of the Printing business that is so profitable for your company? Thank you. And, again,
congratulations.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Well, thank you, Jim, and thank you for the congratulations. And first let me extend my
congratulations to Meg and the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise team on a spectacular earnings and on a very successful
announcement of the spin-merger they're doing with CSC. I think what that demonstrates is that the separation and the
focus of the organizations on the markets that are moving at top speed is really working. It's produced better results for
the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. It's producing solid results for us as well as fueling the innovation engines of both
companies.
So I don't want to comment much further on Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's announcement but I will say that we are
really committed to the long-term success of HP. I'm very happy with the assets that we have in both Printing and
Personal Systems. They're both an – play a very important role within our portfolio as they sort of broad things. We
obviously always continue to look and re-evaluate the markets as they change and measure all of our assets relative to
the strategy and sometimes that results in a divestiture and we made a divestiture this quarter and some marketing
optimization assets. That's an ongoing process. But as far as our major franchises go, we're very committed to both
portfolios.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Operating profit [audio gap] (45:48-45-54) down 50 basis points, as you mentioned, and
that's really driven by currency and the very competitive pricing environment we saw. It was partially offset by the
productivity initiatives that we've got and the broader non-revenue generating cost reductions as well as the favorable
hardware mix. And then we had some benefit from the divestiture gains. It wasn't litigation. It was divestiture of the
marketing optimization assets.
But as I told you, we made the conscious decision to invest that gain back into placing incremental NPV positive units.
And you can see the impact of that, frankly, in the share gains that we had quarter on quarter. As well as basically
bringing our channel inventory levels for supplies in a bit more. From a quarter-on-quarter perspective, the increase
was really driven by cost improvements as well as the divestiture gain and that was by partially offset by competitive
pricing currency and some investments that we made in go-to-market and R&D.

The next question is from Shannon Cross of Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Dion, I wanted to dig a little bit more into the 3D printing initiative
from your standpoint. I'm curious what sort of feedback you've heard from beta customers, some of the partners. How
are you thinking about the initiative over the next year or two? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: I'm super excited by it. I think the feedback from potential channel partners, from end
customers and from analysts and those that follow the industry closely, understand what a breathtaking breakthrough
we've made towards really pulling 3D printing into the mainstream. We released the first production, short run
production 3D printing systems. They're 10 times faster than other product that are out on the marketplace,
unbelievable quality, and most importantly, at half the cost. When you get those three things right, you start to tap into
specific applications that are better to be done by digital 3D printing than they are in an analog fashion.
And the best example I can give you is our 3D printers themselves. 50% of the bill of materials of our 3D printers are
printed by our 3D printers. So our printers are printing themselves. And it's a perfect example in short run
manufacturing of the great business case. We're not doing this to make a point. We're doing this because it's more
economically advantageous us to print these products in 3D than it is to use traditional manufacturing.
So we're very bullish. We have a long and complex, and I like complexity here, roadmap. This is not easy to duplicate.
We're leveraging more than 5,000 patents from our core, leveraging 30 years of innovation that we've had in our
printing business and we're bringing it to bear into a market that really hasn't had a very large mainstream player with
the brand that HP has and reputation that we have.
So we're really excited by the market. We're happy with the ramp we're doing on our partners and our certified channel
partners. We're incredibly excited by the really impressive ecosystem, co-innovators with us, Nike, BMW, Johnson &
Johnson, Siemens, Jabil. The list goes on, both in materials as well as in customers.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. Thank you. And then my second question's just on PCs. I'm curious what kind of
trends you're seeing, how you're thinking about the market. Clearly it's been pretty weak, and how you're also thinking
about some of these future products. Like the x3 and leveraging Continuum because it's sort of – it's not a phone, it's
not a computer. How do you see this market developing both near term and then in the next couple of years with some
of these new technologies?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Yeah, look, we're not surprised by the PC market. I think we were one of the earliest to predict
that these markets would continue to be challenged for quite some time. And as a result of that, we needed to take
immediate action to get our costs in line with where the markets were. But over the long-term, we sort of generally
broadly agree with the analysts and where they expect things to land. We see continued declines in calendar quarter
two. The markets projecting that it will improve in calendar quarter three and four. And we tend to disagree. Now
whether it's low single digits or mid single digits, I guess that's up for debate. And no one's perfect at making those
predictions. But I think things are getting better.
To your sort of second point on some of these new categories, I think as the technology improves, as we're able to fit
more power into smaller platforms, we get to have this continuous evolution of the Continuum all the way from mobile
up to workstation. And these lines are beginning to blur and that enables us to create new products and new categories
like Elite x3.

That technology is not going to slow down. It's only going to accelerate, so I think we've got to start looking as an
industry at the entire spectrum all the way from phones to workstations. Think about that market. Think about how
those hardlines were characterized in the past and how those hardlines will begin to break down in the future. And as
leaders, it's incumbent on us to reinvent what the category is capable of. Whether that be the success we're having with
our x2 or the new category creating products like x3, it's all about changing that continuum.
So we continue to have a very highly disciplined approach to this business. We segment. We segment again. We
navigate the heat in the market and we predict where we think the heat's going be. We're constantly challenging
ourselves on price function value for our customers. We're always taking costs out of the system. And we have to be a
massive innovator and I think we're doing all of that as well.

Operator
Our next question is from Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. Just a couple of clarifications for me. In terms of the supplies, I understand as
you've said many times today and before that it's going to stabilize by the end of 2017. But specifically, Cathie or Dion,
the year-on-year decline 10% constant currency this quarter, does that year-on-year decline stack better from here given
the lower channel inventories you talked about and the initiatives you put into place or could it be uneven for the next
few quarters? Just, I'm trying to understand whether things just the decline gets a little bit easier. And then on free cash
flow, was there anything one-time in nature that drove that free cash flow number this quarter that helped you? Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Thanks, Kulbinder. On the supplies, I think the right way to think about it is, a 16%
decline in supplies revenue. The fact that there was 6 points of currency so you're down 10% constant currency but
you've got 7 points of channel inventory correction. That, our belief is, you don't continue to correct channel inventory
on a go-forward basis. So really when you're looking at what, I guess, we sometimes refer to as real supplies growth or
decline, we're at about minus 3. And we, obviously, as we go through 2017, we expect that that will continue to
improve so that it stabilizes by the end of 2017. But again, largely in line with what we expected.
And then from a free cash flow perspective, a couple of things. First off, where we saw particularly strong performance
was in the cash conversion cycle. If you look back to Q1, our cash conversion cycle was minus 15 days, and we now
are at minus 24. And we basically hit on every one of those metrics. Dion mentioned it. It was a company-wide
initiative in which we educated and helped people become even more conscious about cash flow.
We enlisted the help of our sales reps in getting collections done. It was an incredible team effort and something in
many ways we've instituted now kind of permanent changes and permanent initiatives around that free cash flow and
the cash conversion cycle. I also just really briefly want to mention the fact that it, our free cash flow on a year-to-date
basis, also includes about $170 million of separation cash outflows, which obviously are more one-time in nature.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.
Dion J. Weisler
Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. I hope you would agree we delivered really solid results here and we did
exactly what we said we would do, and that's important to us as a leadership team. We do know how to execute
regardless of market conditions. We don't stick our head in the sands here. We understand what's going on in the
market and how to adjust our organization accordingly.
We're delivering on our financial commitments. We've made solid progress. More work do. We're executing across
core growth in the future and lots of proof points there. We're shifting to higher margin and growth product segments
and we're setting this company up for long-term success. So thank you very much.
