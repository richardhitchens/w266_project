Indra K. Nooyi
Thank you, Jamie and thank you all for joining us this morning.
I am pleased to report that our second quarter results were very much in line with our expectations and that we remain
on track to meet our full-year 2017 financial goals. For the quarter, while our reported results continue to be impacted
by macro-volatility and weak currencies, organic revenue was up more than 3% globally, a sequential acceleration from
our growth rate in the first quarter. We generated organic revenue growth across both developed and developing and
emerging markets, with developed markets up 2% and D&E markets growing 6%.
The portfolio generated strong net price utilization and core constant currency operating profit grew 7%. Core constant
currency EPS grew 13%. Our results reflect the power and durability of our portfolio, its ability to deliver sustainable
and well-balanced results despite ongoing pockets of macro and geopolitical challenges in a number of our key markets
around the globe and an increasingly dynamic retail and consumer environment.
Let's briefly review the performance in the quarter across our sectors, starting with North America, where organic
revenue grew 2% and core constant currency operating profit was up 4%. Importantly, year to date through the second
quarter, we have also generated more U.S. retail sales growth than all other $5 billion-plus manufacturers combined.
Frito-Lay North America had another very strong quarter. Volume and organic revenue accelerated sequentially from
Q1, as we expected, and results reflected a very good balance of volume growth, net price utilization and margin
expansion. We feel very good about the business with innovation, pricing and execution all on target. We are pleased to
report that Frito-Lay alone was the number one contributor to total [ph] use (04:22) food and beverage retail growth by
all $5 billion-plus manufacturers for the end of Q2.
Similarly, North America Beverages grew organic revenue and core operating profit, but our growth rates were limited
in part by adverse channel and subcategory mix in the quarter. As we have seen a lower rate of year-to-date growth in
the C-store channel compared to last year and water growth outpaced the balance of our business. We are encouraged
by continued strength in our stills portfolio with good growth in Gatorade, our total water portfolio, which benefited
from the strong introduction of LIFEWTR, Lipton and our distribution of Rockstar. In fact, in just five months of sales
since its launch in Q1, LIFEWTR has already reached $70 million in retail sales across measured channels, was the top
brand contributing to LRB retail sales growth in the second quarter and is on track to generate approximately $200
million in retail sales on an annualized basis.
On the carbonated side, we're encouraged by the performance of Pepsi Zero Sugar but have more work to do on the
carbonated portfolio overall. We will also be allocating a bit more marketing behind the big sparkling brands in the
second half. We have strong activation for the summer behind Pepsi Fire and our DEW-S-A program followed by
strong execution behind the NFL as we get to the fall. As we execute our second-half plans, we will remain very
focused on driving better net price realization and letting our marketing and innovation drive the top line.
Quaker Foods North America performance continues to be impacted by broader central store pressures but is
performing well relative to other large breakfast manufacturers. Going forward, we have powerful programming in
place aimed to improve the trajectory of the business. So for example, we have activation behind portable breakfast
innovation, namely Breakfast Flats, that we launched in 2016, and Breakfast Squares that were launched in the first
quarter. And we just launched a new and first-to-market Overnight Oats Cup in the second quarter to capitalize on the
recent and growing consumer trend of preparing chilled oats using a variety of healthy ingredients.
Turning to our sectors outside North America. In Latin America, we continue to see very challenging macroeconomic
conditions, geopolitical instability and high levels of inflation in key markets including Brazil and Argentina, which are

dampening consumer spending. Within this context, our businesses are performing well. Our largest market in the
region, Mexico, encouragingly has been relatively stable and resilient and is performing well and posted double-digit
organic revenue growth in the second quarter. While our core profit performance in the first half of the year was
impacted by difficult economic conditions, we expect to see an improvement in core profit growth in the second half as
we lap incremental investments from last year and we realize productivity from supply chain initiatives.
Similarly, we are experiencing macro challenges in a number of markets throughout our Asia, Middle East, North
Africa segment including the significant currency devaluation in Egypt and the economic impact in a number of
markets across the Middle East stemming from persistently low oil prices. Related to these, we're experiencing
significant cost inflation in Egypt arising from adverse transaction ForEx, and we're dealing with a recently imposed
carbonated soft drink tax in Saudi Arabia.
So we're adjusting our business to address these challenges. We're pricing to cover the increased cost of doing business.
We're going more aggressively after productivity to reduce our overall costs, and we continue to transform our
beverage portfolio to offer more noncarbonated options and reducing sugar levels across the portfolio.
On the other hand, we're encouraged by a number of bright spots in the region, including China, where we saw
double-digit beverage organic revenue growth and mid-single-digit snack organic revenue growth, and markets like
Pakistan and Egypt where organic revenue was up double digits.
And finally, turning to Europe and Sub-Sahara Africa, we had very good results across the region with organic revenue
growth in each of our major markets and a sequential acceleration overall. Russia, our largest market in the region, had
mid-single digit organic revenue growth and very strong operating margin improvement. As you saw in the release, our
results also benefited from our sale of our minority stake in Britvic. Even excluding this gain, core operating profit was
up 19%, so we're very encouraged by the performance in the region and are optimistic about the outlook for the balance
of the year. We continue to manage what's in our control, and our portfolio of products and geographies is working.
And so with half the year behind us and our performance overall in line with our plans and expectations, we remain
very much on track to deliver our full year financial targets of at least 3% organic revenue growth and 8% core constant
currency EPS growth. And we continue to deliver these strong, reliable results even as our industry is undergoing some
interesting shifts from multiple angles.
Consumer habits and behaviors continue to evolve, while some trends like consumers' increasing demand for
convenience and variety have been present for decades but are becoming more pronounced. Consumers' shopping
habits are rapidly adapting to evolving and new retail formats and their lifestyles are increasingly influenced by
pervasive social and digital media and mobile technology. And this in turn requires new marketing models that harness
the power of digital media and big data in a way that enables us to communicate with consumers on a much more
personal and individualized level.
Consumers are also seeking more value and benefits from what they purchase and consume. They're also seeking more
premium experiences and at the same time seeking value. And across the spectrum, consumers continue to be interested
in health and wellness but with differing definitions, [ph] often not science-based of what this means (10:55).
Perhaps more pronounced are the changes we're witnessing in retail where the lines are blurring between channels.
Brick-and-mortar retailers are building deep e-commerce capability, pure play e-commerce is moving into
brick-and-mortar and virtually every channel is melding aspects of grocery, convenience, food service, meal kits,
prepared meals and home delivery.
So with all this change occurring and at an accelerated pace, we can look upon the spirit in our industry with hesitation
and pessimism or with a sense of excitement and optimism. We choose to take the optimistic approach because this
period offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to strengthen our business and capture new avenues of growth. We
believe we are well-positioned to win in this environment.
In fact, we anticipated and prepared for many of the trends we're witnessing today. To begin, we participate in growing
categories with products that are well-suited to consumers' continued desire for convenience, on-the-go portability and

snacking in place of structured meals. Many of our brands occupy the number one and number two spot in their
respective categories giving them the scale to cut through an increasingly cluttered and fragmented media landscape,
especially in the digital realm. Our product portfolio have the stretch to continue to evolve with consumer needs. We
have the ability to innovate to provide new benefits and value to the consumer in ways that are not only consistent with
the brand's equity but in many ways strengthen it.
A few examples come to mind. Lipton Tea. Over the years, we have not only added more variety but we have
strengthened the brand by introducing increasingly premium offerings. First with Pure Leaf and more recently with the
Tea House Collection, resulting in the leading share position we enjoy today. Or Mountain Dew, where over time we've
expanded the trademark from traditional green bottle Dew and Diet Dew to exciting line extensions like Code Red,
White Out and Voltage and our very successful Kickstart lineup.
Or Doritos, where our loyal consumers have embraced flavor extensions of the core product and innovations we have
taken to food service and quick-serve restaurants. Or Quaker, where we have provided increasing portability and
convenience to a hearty, healthy breakfast through the introduction of Breakfast Squares and Breakfast Flats. Beyond
our product and brand advantages, we also have a very balanced geographic footprint that enables us to weather
pockets of macroeconomic volatility.
Importantly, we have extremely strong relationships with our retail partners and meaningful presence and scale across
all our relevant channels. In each of our five largest markets, comprising approximately 75% of our total net revenue,
we're the largest or number two food and beverage manufacturer based on retail sales. Regardless of channel, our
products and brands possess a number of importance characteristics that make them highly appealing to our customers.
They're often purchased on impulse, which makes them highly incremental, and therefore, build basket and box size.
On promotion, they drive traffic. They're highly complementary to other food and beverage purchases, and they have
high velocities, which makes them very productive on whatever shelf they occupy and therefore they are big cash flow
generators. These attributes translate to the very foundation of the value we bring to our customers regardless of
channel. We deliver sales growth and cash flow for our customers.
And our partnership with customers goes well beyond supplying great products. Our deep capability enabled by our
scale and years of extensive investment allow us to work as a strategic partner, delivering value in the areas of supply
chain management, consumer and shopper insight, social and digital consumer engagement, research and development,
design, data analytics and e-commerce. In fact, our execution with retailers, leveraging the full breadth of our
capabilities led us to be named the number one best in class manufacturer in the most recent annual Kantar Retail
PoweRanking survey in the United States. And this was further reinforced a few weeks ago when I attended a
consumer goods forum in Berlin. In meeting after meeting with our retail partners from around the globe, they
expressed how much they value the growth we generate for them.
And finally, one of the most compelling reasons for our optimism is our culture. Over decades, we have built and
developed a culture that thrives on change. We have the heart of a challenger, a can-do spirit with a must-do resolve.
We view the evolution of our business, that is products, supply chains, processes, organizations or business models, as
our natural state. Our business today is very different than it was five years ago, and we expect it will be very different
five years from now.
Consider our beverage portfolio transformation that began decades ago when we declared that we would become a total
beverage company. And over the years, we have built an enviable portfolio of leading brands across virtually every
sub-segment of the beverage category including Gatorade, Tropicana, Aquafina, Lipton and Starbucks, through organic
introductions, joint ventures and acquisitions. And this transformation continues as evidenced by our recent
introductions of products like LIFEWTR, Lemon Lemon and IZZE FUSIONS and our acquisition of KeVita; or how
we've continually evolved our supply chain over the years as the retail landscape has changed and newest technologies
have come to market. Our supply chain at Frito-Lay today is very different from the one we operated just a few years
ago. For example, our deployment of GES has enabled us to handle more SKUs, fulfill demand with greater speed and
accuracy, improve product quality and freshness, and operate more efficiently; or our embrace of Performance with
Purpose, the journey we embarked on more than 10 years ago that has transformed our business to adapt to the

changing world around us. We've reduced added sugar, saturated fat and sodium in many of our products, while
continuing to expand our lineup of nutritious foods and beverages to meet growing consumer demand.
Our product transformation efforts to date have resulted in a portfolio where we now derive approximately 45% of our
net revenue from products that we refer to as guilt-free. These products include diet and other beverages that contain 70
calories or less from added sugar per 12-ounce serving and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat as well
as what we call Everyday Nutrition products. And a full 28 points of the 45 points is made up of what we refer to as
Everyday Nutrition, products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables, protein, unsweetened tea and
water.
We have steadily improved our operational water use and energy efficiency, reducing our packaging and waste and
promoting responsible agricultural practices globally. We've built a workplace that attracts and retains the world's best
and brightest. And we intend to continue to make strides in these areas. We've announced even more aggressive
product, planet and people goals that we intend to achieve by 2025.
Net, we feel very good about where we stand. We have a leading product portfolio, balanced development across
channels and geographies, broad capabilities, a robust productivity agenda, a great corporate culture and excellent
talent. These factors in combination have enabled us to continue to deliver an attractive balance of top-line and
bottom-line growth and they give us the confidence to lead into an ever-changing environment with a sense of
excitement and cautious optimism.
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?
Hugh F. Johnston
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to our outlook for 2017. Looking ahead and as we set out in
the release, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of at least 3%, fueled by successful product innovation and
strong marketplace execution, but tempered by a cautious macro outlook. Based on current market consensus rates,
foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact full-year reported net revenue by approximately two percentage
points, consistent with our previous guidance, and negatively impact core EPS by approximately two percentage points,
which is a one-point improvement from our previous guidance.
We intend to reinvest the Britvic share sale gain in the balance of the year, so I would encourage you not to flow
through the impact of the gain in your full-year models. Given the variety of macro issues we are facing around the
globe, we think it is prudent to use this upside to strengthen the business. As a result of the improvement in foreign
exchange outlook on earnings, we now expect core earnings of $5.13 per share. This reflects core constant currency
EPS growth of 8%, offset by the 2 point ForEx impact.
In terms of other key considerations and assumptions embedded in our full-year outlook, we continue to expect raw
material inflation, driven by both an increase in our basket of commodities and additional pressure from transaction
ForEx. We continue to expect core operating margin expansion, fueled by our productivity programs, and we continue
to expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.
Turning to cash flow, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise discipline over capital
allocation, with prudent reinvestment into the business, and the majority of our free cash flow, excluding certain items,
to be returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
So for 2017, we continue to expect approximately $10 billion in cash flow from operations, net capital spending of
approximately $3 billion, approximately $7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items, cash dividends of
approximately $4.5 billion. Recall that we previously announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend beginning
with the June payment. This represents the 45th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend; and share
repurchases of approximately $2 billion.

Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following three items as they relate to the balance of the
year. First, please keep in mind that we will be lapping our strongest rate of quarterly organic revenue growth in Q3,
with a particularly tough lap in our North America Beverages sector. Second, while we are lapping some incremental
investments related to the 53rd week from last year, we do intend to reinvest the Britvic share sale gain this year.
Hence, we expect there may be some variability and volatility in the core operating margin. Third, we expect the
negative impact of foreign exchange translation to be similar to what we saw this quarter. And consequently, we expect
the balance-of-year core EPS growth to be weighted toward Q4.
With that, we're ready to take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hey. Good morning. So, Indra, I was hoping you could give us some perspective on the
U.S. CPG environment. Obviously, it's been weak year to date, but also specifically in Q2, we've seen category
weakness across the board, including in your segment. So I was hoping for detail on what's driving the softness in your
mind from a consumer standpoint across CPG. Are you seeing any signs of improvement in Q3? I guess Hugh's
comment on the tough top-line comparison might indicate you're not so far, but any reason to think basically that
consumer outlook may improve in the back half of the year?
And then specifically on your business, the flat Frito-Lay North America volume result in Q2 were essentially flat. Do
you think that will improve in the back half of the year? And how concerned are you also on the U.S. carbonated soft
drink side by the year-over-year market share losses and plans to improve that going forward?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: 10 questions, Dara. That was 10 questions very wonderfully rolled into one, but we're going to
try to answer every one of those. Let me start by saying that I think you're beginning to see the limitations of the
syndicated data because, as I mentioned in my script, the channels are beginning to blur between foodservice, retail,
home delivery, restaurants, everything, channels are beginning to blur. And when you have blurring channels, you now
have a shopping occasion being replaced by a home delivery or replaced by a meal delivery of kits. So what we have to
do is rethink what is the real growth of the marketplace, the food and beverage marketplace in a much more holistic
way.
There's no question that the syndicated data showed a slowdown in the overall market, I'd say, in the first half. Rather
than talk about quarter to quarter, let's just talk about the first half. Slightly south of 2% is what we saw in the first half.
But I think if you include a much broader definition of the market, I think you're going to see what the traditional
growth is, which is, population plus some, more in the range of somewhere between 2% and 2.5%. I think that's what
you see as an overall growth rate. I think we all as manufacturers have to start to rethink how we serve this multiplicity
of channels and how we should retool our business models to serve every one of these fragmenting channels. So that's a
challenge all of us have and we've been looking at that very, very carefully.
Now let's talk a little bit about the category weakness. I think we've – on salty snacks in particular, let me speak to that.
Our belief, and we watch volume, revenue and pricing very, very carefully on a weekly basis, I think where the market
is today, when we can take pricing, we should take the pricing. And we've been trying to move the portfolio more to
premium products. And the good news is that we're actually making progress in Frito-Lay to move the business more to
premium products. And so, I'd say this thing will right itself. We are gaining share overall in the marketplace. We are
gaining value share, which is really what we are focused on. We are managing the mix very carefully, managing
channel mix, product mix very carefully. We feel pretty good about the Frito-Lay performance and where we are
moving the portfolio, nudging it towards premium, balancing the value/mainstream part of the portfolio very, very

carefully. So we feel good about that.
On the beverage side, we've got good price realization, so I feel good about that. Do I have some concerns about our
carbonated soft drink business? Not concerns, but I think we have more opportunity. And I think that as we move
towards the second half of the year and we sort of fine-tune our calendar, you'll start seeing more activity from us on
carbonated soft drinks. On balance, we have good innovation and I wouldn't say we are concerned, but we are watching
it very, very carefully to make sure that everything that we can control, we do right by these businesses, big businesses,
very attractive businesses, we just want to make sure we get our fair share of those businesses. But the key thing is
we're going to focus on price realization and let marketing drive the top line.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Great.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Steve.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Good morning, good morning. Actually, I was hoping we just – maybe just clean up a little
bit on both of those two topics, Frito-Lay and North American Beverages. On Frito-Lay, the 3.5 points of net pricing
this quarter, is there a way to just frame how much of that was rate versus the channel or package mix premiumization
that you called out, Indra, versus maybe some lingering Sabra effects? I'm just trying to figure out what's driving that
price because to the extent – I think the concern is that the price gap gets too wide and that becomes problematic on
volume. Just love to hear your explanation there.
And then on North American Beverages, I was hoping you could also give more color, maybe a quantification on the
favorable legal settlement, Hugh, and the promotional spending accruals that helped segment profit there this quarter. I
think that's the second quarter in a row where we've had favorable promotional spending accruals and I'd love just to
better understand the magnitude and the dynamics there. So thanks for both.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yes, happy to answer both of those, Steve. In terms of price versus mix in Frito, round
numbers, it was about 2 points price and about 4.5 points of mix. Mix, as Indra mentioned, is driven by premium
products such as Lay's Poppables. So when you're selling a potato puff, you're obviously filling the bag with less
weight than you would, say, with a bag of Fritos. So we think that's a good win for the consumer and it's obviously a
good win for us as well.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: And it's a great tasting product.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Fantastic tasting product. In terms of the legal settlement and the other items that you
mentioned, it was in the teens in millions. So it was a – not small number, but not a gigantic number by any stretch of
the imagination.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. Hey. Wanted to touch on two topics, if I could, please. One, Indra, your first answer this
morning around changes of channels and shifts that you mentioned in your prepared remarks as well, have you guys
really figured out how to sell impulse online well? How do you get that cold icy package or quick $0.89 or $0.99 bag of
Lay's to really resonate online without the immediacy of that channel? It seems to be becoming a bigger and bigger
deal given just the lower foot traffic in brick-and-mortar. So I'd love to hear your philosophy on that.

The second topic I want to dig a little bit deeper on, a few folks have mentioned it earlier, Steve mentioned it a second
ago, it was on operating margins more broadly. So I was hoping if you could quantify operating margins, the impact of
productivity, the impact of commodities, the impact of promotional spending accrual settlements, as well as the
marketing spend. Because if I look at two of those in particular on productivity, we've heard for many, many years now
doing all those cost savings on an annual basis but we don't actually see your SG&A as a percentage of sales
particularly low versus peers, even with some adjustments given bottler structure, et cetera. And we're now starting to
see core operating margins have difficulty expanding. In fact, they're down 10 basis points this quarter.
So is it that the low hanging fruit is harder to get now? I mean, the lowest hanging fruit, I guess, is gone, and it's hard to
show. So would love to some more detail after quantification on productivity. And on marketing spend, you didn't
increase marketing spend in FLNA, QFNA, NAB, AMENA this quarter and it looks like year-to-date as well and that's
where you're seeing volume struggles. And on the one hand you could say – one could say, well, that's causalities and
no ad spend growth leads to challenged volume growth. Or actually is it judicious decision-making because those
markets aren't going to grow anyway? So I know there's lot packed in there, but it's really around the second part of the
topic of operating margins, please. Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: So I'm going to let Hugh get all the answers ready for the 10 questions you asked on operating
margin, Ali. Let me talk about the changes in channels. We're all figuring it out as we go along. The good news is, our
e-commerce business is growing brilliantly. We're doing very, very well. We're not yet ready to talk about it in any
significant way. Maybe in the next couple of calls we will start focusing on that, but it's growing really, really nicely.
But it's growing with our traditional products and our traditional packaging, if you want to call it that. There's clearly an
opportunity for us to think about innovation for e-commerce, which is what we're all focused on. We want to make sure
that our snacks are more shippable, not just on click and collect but more also for deliveries so that the cube efficiency
is there.
And on beverages, I think there are two issues. One is the cold delivery of the beverages if consumers so desire ice cold
beverages delivered to them, which I find it hard to believe, but you know you can never tell. And then how do we
make sure that we address this whole delivery of water because beverages is largely water. So we are looking at
meaningful innovation both in snacks and beverages in order to address the exploding growth of e-commerce. And with
our big brands, I think we're well positioned.
Now let me come to the impulse nature of our products. I think the whole e-commerce area is going to be impulse as
you see it in a brick-and-mortar store which then translates to e-commerce and then becomes part of a replenishment
cycle. But then as people stop going to brick-and-mortar and start shopping only on e-commerce, which well could be
the GenZ, the new iGeneration, if you want to call it that, I think the newest digital tools can easily afford you the
ability to create the impulse experience online.
We've seen so many virtual-reality tools right now that can actually simulate grocery stores or whatever version of a
grocery store you want online and you can easily navigate the aisles in just with a click, shop for whatever you want.
So I think in an interesting way, there's infinite possibilities to create impulse all through technology online. And I
think as this market matures and evolves, you're going to see a lot of that happening, and we are focused on developing
all of these tools ourselves with our e-commerce partners to make sure that they're responsive to them when they so
choose to go that way.
So with that, let me turn it to Hugh to give you the three tires on operating margin. Go ahead, Hugh.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Sure. Happy to. Ali, a couple of comments on that. First is, as we pointed out at the
beginning of the year, we expect to see operating margin improvement strengthen as we go from the front half to the
back half. That's what you saw from Q1 going to Q2, and that's what you'll see as we head into the back half of the year
as well. So I think things generally are tracking to our expectations.
Regarding advertising and marketing spend, we have said many times that we would invest further in A&M to the
degree that we saw a return on investing further in A&M. As we move from 5.2% of sales to 5.7%, that was a move to
get more competitive. As we moved over the past four years from 5.7% to about 6.7% of sales, those were all based on

good ROI. So I think you'll see the A&M change as we introduce new products or as we see opportunities to earn a
good return. We're not going to blindly put money into A&M.
Do I think you'll see A&M going backwards? No, I don't expect that to be the case in a meaningful way. It could go
forward to the degree that we see good investment opportunities. More broadly on productivity, truthfully, I think we
have years of productivity still in front of us. The cost bucket that we evaluate productivity against what we call OpEx
is about $28 billion. It's got a natural inflation rate of 3% to 4% per year. So as we continue to drive for percentage
types of productivity, you see that bucket basically staying relatively flat.
I do expect that we will, as we've guided in the past, continue to see steady margin improvement while we reinvest in
growth. So I think overall, the margin versus growth equation is one that hasn't changed much relative to where we've
been in recent years.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: And I think, Hugh, it's fair to say that with the changing marketplace where there's blurring of
retail channels, the consumer preferences changing, the marketing models changing, we have to invest in these new
capabilities in order to generate the top line growth we're generating. So we intend to continue to invest judiciously in
these new areas so we can sustain our top line growth globally.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Absolutely.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. One of the questions that I guess – or themes that have come
up this year specifically in North America has been I think with all the changes in the retail environment some concerns
about pricing. And you've seen it especially in the food industry with the food stock and how they've performed this
year. And I think generally the concern is that there is going to be more sort of deflationary pressure at retail as retailers
try to drive some traffic or keep customers. So can you kind of talk to how you're thinking about that, not so much for
this year but over the next few years, do you think that there is going to be maybe a need to just maybe change the way
you've thought about pricing philosophically, just given the changes in the channel?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: We model out different channel shifts, what could be the pricing implications. We look at
analogs from Europe when there were lots of retail disruptions. And then we look at what do we need to do to get
innovation-driven pricing, mix-driven pricing and then what do we need to offset with productivity, how do we need to
go deeper on productivity programs.
So, Bryan, what we do do is model this out constantly. We look at multiple scenarios and then we figure out how to get
the best blend of top- and bottom-line growth in a changing retail environment. The good news is that as the retail
environment shifts, we just have to retool our model for the retail environment shifts. The market's still growing. That's
the good news. And these are huge categories. So our goal is to capture the growth with a changing environment with
our innovation in our big brands. That's why we focus so much on innovation, because we believe innovation can
actually create consumer demand and get us a price premium. And then we keep investing in our brands, both at the big
brand level and the emerging brands like KeVita and Naked so that we can grow our business on both ends of the
spectrum.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.
<Q - Mark Swartzberg>: Oh, hi. Good morning, Indra, Hugh.

<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Swartzberg>: February, we came to an interesting point in history; it was the five-year anniversary of your
rebasing earnings. And no doubt, the environment remains and arguably has become more challenging, but this year
we're at just shy of 3% organic revenue. If you look at 2012 through 2016, you were at 4s and 5s. And we spent time in
this Q&A talking about the need to invest. So my question is simply: headwinds are always there; they're always
changing. But when you think about your internal capacity to invest – and of course, that relates to the resolve to cut
costs and where you put that money – do you think, A, that the need to reinvest is getting greater, that you have to
actually pick up the pace of investment because of the headwinds getting harder? And then B, if it is getting harder, do
you think you have the resources, the ability to even up the productivity target to address that greater pressure?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I don't know about harder; I'd say different. I think it's different buckets, different areas. Some
areas that we're comfortable with; some areas where we have to develop new muscle. But that's part of life in our food
and beverage industry. I've been in PepsiCo for 23 years, and every five years or so there's a brand-new skill we have to
develop. And this place is amazingly resilient. We develop the muscle. We hire from the outside when we have to. We
retrain, and then we go on. So I wouldn't say it's getting harder. I'd just say that it's different buckets, and we have to
put in the work to make sure that we can deliver growth in this new environment.
As I said to – a response to an earlier question, we are looking at how much productivity we need to deliver to offset
any price inflation if it happens because of retail disruption. So we're constantly looking at how we need to balance top
line and bottom line growth. And clearly, productivity is a major factor in bottom line growth delivery. So we are
looking at that. Hugh, did you want to add anything to that point?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: No. I think you've captured it effectively. I do think we're doing different and new skills, but
that's something to be expected. And as far as having the resources, I think we can continue to drive sufficient
productivity to stay ahead of the wave.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Yes. And I think a lot of the new technologies actually allow us to deliver more productivity.
We just need to – I think the key thing people have to take away is that in order to deliver productivity downstream,
you have to invest upstream. So you have to deliver – invest today to get the benefits tomorrow. Benefits don't come
out of thin air. And so what we are doing is investing today to get more productivity downstream.

Your next question comes from line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Hi, Pablo. How are you?
<Q - Pablo Zuanic>: I'm doing fine. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Look, just a question on – maybe it's going
back in time – but 15 years ago, the industry went through significant consolidations with Quaker, Kraft, Nabisco,
General Mills, Pillsbury, Kellogg, Keebler. And we are talking about the significant changes taking place in the retail
channel. We're seeing retail reconsolidation, consumer changes, e-commerce. Do you think the industry needs to, as
you mentioned, develop new muscles and a way to do that, that we should see another consolidation wave in the
industry?
I mean, I guess I'm asking you to talk a bit from an industry point of view but also from a Pepsi point of view; does size
being bigger help to adapt to these new changes or what happened 15 years ago in hindsight was the wrong answer, that
wave of consolidation. And just a quick follow-up. If Unilever were to change hands, I suppose that you could lose the
Lipton agreement, right? You would be probably – there would be a penalty that you will need to be compensated, but I
assume that that contract would be taken away. If you can expand on that. Thank you.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: So first of all, we don't lose the Lipton business even if it changes hands. So I would rest
assured that we're protected there. On this whole industry outlook, Pablo, I think you guys on the sell side are much
more knowledgeable about industry and industry trends because you've been following them for such a long time. We

Your next question comes from line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Lauren.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: I just wanted to follow up again on this scanner conversation and just specifically
relative to your business on North America Beverages because the scanner data and your results have really been
diverging 300, 400 – now I think 450 basis points this quarter. So if you could just talk a little bit about where the sort
of "untracked" data is coming from.
And then the other piece was that at least in the scanner data both Mountain Dew overall and specifically Kickstart and
Gatorade slowed dramatically, both of those down double digits. So if you could just talk a little bit about that. Was
anything specific plans you may have where you're anticipating those to recover at least again in the track channel
piece of it? Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Thanks, Lauren, for the question. First of all, we don't reconcile our data with the scanner data.
We just keep running the business and just we keep selling, we keep making sure that our product is on the shelf.
Remember, we are high velocity products, so we know on a weekly basis exactly what we sell and what's being pulled
by the consumer. So we have good data on what's happening in the marketplace.
I have no idea why the scanner data diverges so much. It's been happening in many markets and I think it reflects some
of the limitation of syndicated data and they need to go back and retool it. But we are very comfortable with where we
are and we're just going to keep running the business this way.
Indra K. Nooyi
So with that, let me thank you for your questions. And to summarize, we are pleased with our results for the first half.
We remain on track to deliver our full-year financial targets and we feel well positioned to continue to perform well
even in the midst of change and disruption. Thank you very much for joining us this morning and for the confidence
you've placed in us with your investment.
