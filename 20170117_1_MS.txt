MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Sharon Yeshaya
Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations.
During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release, financial supplement, and strategic deck, copies of
which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are
subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding

duplicated or reproduced without our consent.
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Good morning, everyone. In a moment, I'm going to take you through our outlook and plan for 2017, but before doing
so, let me briefly touch on the fourth quarter.
It's fair to say the year finished a lot better than it began. After a difficult first quarter, Morgan Stanley delivered three
consecutive quarters with revenues at approximately $9 billion, each with an ROE north of 8%. While our fourth
quarter contains some positive and negative adjustments, which Jon would touch on shortly, our operating performance
was consistent with what you've seen from us since the beginning of the second quarter.

There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we ended 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016. The surge in
consumer confidence after the U.S. election, the recent and anticipated Fed rate hikes, the strengthening U.S. economy,
and potential corporate tax reform are positives for our business. Notwithstanding these potential positives, we intend
to remain extremely disciplined. This is especially true with regard to expense management.
Before transitioning to our annual deck, let me say a few words about Morgan Stanley's management team. Many
members of the firm operating in management committees have spent much of their careers at Morgan Stanley with
many having dedicated more than 20 years to this firm. The stability of the team, combined with its depth of experience
and operating discipline, honed in the difficult years during and after the financial crisis, is an undeniable asset in the
years ahead. In the next minutes, you will hear us delve in the numbers and goals, but it is the culture and people of this
firm that will get us to where we want to be.
Now with that, please turn to the slides that you can find on the Investor Relations website, after which Jon would take
you through the quarter in detail. Following our prepared remarks, we will both take your questions.
Slide 3 outlines the key strategic objectives for 2017 that we reviewed on this call last year. In each instance, we feel
we're on track. We are on course to deliver $1 billion of expense reductions through our cost base in 2017. On
relatively flat annual revenues in 2016, we reduced non-compensation expenses significantly and continue to exercise
discipline on compensation.
At the end of 2015, we undertook a meaningful restructuring of our Fixed Income business in an effort to better align
its capital and resources with the market opportunity. Our goal was to maintain our historical revenue footprint of $1
billion plus per quarter but with significantly fewer resources.
In 2016, we exceeded this average quarterly target with full year revenues at $5.1 billion and delivered three
consecutive quarters above that $1 billion mark. In Wealth Management, the full year's pre-tax margin was 22%, and
we expect to hit the 23% to 25% range by year-end 2017. We also achieved record pre-tax earnings of $3.4 billion in
the face of a number of macro headwinds, including sustained low interest rates and muted retail investor engagement.
In 2016, we received the conditional non-objection to our CCAR capital plan which included increasing our buybacks
by 40% to $3.5 billion and our quarterly dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.20 per share. We resubmitted our revised
capital plan in December and look forward to hearing back from the Fed Reserve on our results. Finally, 2016's ROE
demonstrated progress towards our 9% to 11% goal for 2017.
Turning to slide 4, you can see that our ROE obviously was 8%. Assuming normal market conditions prevail as they
did over the last three quarters when our ROE averaged 8.5%, we remain on target for our 9% to 11% goal for 2017.
As outlined on slide 5, there are a number of opportunities for us to continue improving our operating performance. I'm
going to address each of these five opportunities in turn. On slide 6, turning to that now, you can see that although our
total revenues were relatively flat in 2016, we grew our pre-tax profit excluding DVA by nearly $1 billion. As a
management team, we are focused on controlling what we can. Optimizing our expense base has been a key tenet of
this approach and is a measure of our operating leverage.
Project Streamline's 200 expense initiatives have yielded meaningful results to-date. Notable successes include
leveraging our Centers of Excellence, reducing head count in core locations, and closing redundant data centers.
Additionally, the broad-based nature of the initiatives has energized a more expense-focused culture across the whole
firm. This should help us realize the remaining savings potential in 2017 and maintain operating leverage in a rising
revenue environment.
On the compensation side, our ISG expense compensation ratio met our target to be at or below 37%. Savings were
driven by the Fixed Income restructuring and our continued discipline. In Wealth Management, we demonstrated
progress towards our goal of achieving a compensation ratio of 56% or lower. We intend to maintain that discipline
consistent with the goals mentioned while recognizing the competitive dynamics in this business. The combination of
these efforts resulted in a meaningful improvement in our expense efficiency ratio from 77.2% in 2015 excluding DVA
to below 75% in 2016.

As illustrated on slide 7, in advisory, we have grown our share in completed M&A and retained our ranking in a market
that exhibited resilience in 2016. The year was more challenging for the equity underwriting market, as volatility and
idiosyncratic risk events kept many would-be issuers on the sidelines. On a diminished industry fee base, we
maintained our market share. Looking to 2017, we are optimistic and see upside from a normalization of volumes.
Slide 8 outlines key strategic priorities within our Sales and Trading business. In the fall of 2015, we unified our Sales
and Trading franchise under one leadership team, and 2016 was a year of integration. We're now managing the
divisions holistically, aiming to optimize resources, talent, capital, and technology.
Our Equities division has consistently been number one among global peers. We continue to refine our strategy with
the goal of maintaining that leadership across regions, including as the top franchise among global firms in Europe and
profitably growing wallet share. This includes deepening our relationships in prime brokerage as well as focusing on
providing content, capital, and execution services to clients in flow trading.
In addition, we remain committed to investing in our Asia franchise as we expect a positive long-term secular trend of
increasing activity and improving liquidity in the region. While the equity sales and trading landscape remains
competitive, the shifting dynamics may benefit the leading players.
The restructuring Fixed Income made a year ago was consistent with our objective to have a credible and critically
sized business that was relevant to our clients and supported adjacencies that exist with our ISG and Wealth
Management franchises.
Turning to slide 9, as you can see on one measure of success, we set an internal target which was externally
communicated to generate average revenue on a quarterly basis of at least $1 billion with reduced resources. As
properly discussed, we met this goal and we want to ensure it plays out through 2017 and beyond.
The results are encouraging. Importantly, in a more favorable environment characterized by rising rates, more active
macro markets, and vibrant corporate activity, we expect to participate in a growing wallet but with a lower cost base.
So, to finish our discussion on Sales and Trading, I'd like to point to the very strong performance in equities. For the
third consecutive year, we increased wallet share to 20%, maintaining revenues in excess of $8 billion in a shrinking
market.
Let's turn to slide 10. In 2008, we embarked on a multiyear transformation of the Wealth Management business. The
Smith Barney acquisition gave us an undeniable scale benefit, particularly when combined with ongoing cost
management. At the same time, we built our bank infrastructure and have seen material growth in annuitized revenues.
As you can see, this led to a 22% compound growth rate in our pre-tax earnings since 2010 against a 4% growth in
revenues.
However, as shown on slide 11, what has been missing from this picture is retail investor engagement and any material
benefit from rising rates. The Fed's actions in December and expected rate increases in 2017 and 2018 combined with
more positive investor sentiment lead us to believe there is real upside to the business over the next several years.
Realizing that upside will require us to maintain expense discipline as we grow revenues.
In addition, two years from now, the 10-year retention notes that were put in place with our Smith Barney acquisition
will expire. Further, our U.S. bank subsidiaries continue to provide us with organic revenue opportunities, not only
because of the expected rate rise but also because of the continuation of our deposit deployment strategy. We intend to
discuss this in more detail in the year ahead.
Before moving ahead, let me spend a few moments on slide 12 to discuss the digital landscape. Much has been said
about the digital shift in financial services, and there is no question that technology is changing some areas in the
Wealth Management arena. It is an important strategic component for us to realize the business's growth potential.
Our strategy's primary goals are threefold. First, we want to modernize our branch system using digital to allow our
financial advisors and branch operations to be more efficient serving current clients. Second, we want to provide our

financial advisors with the necessary tools and analytics to deliver high-quality advice and engage with clients through
a variety of channels. And finally and over time, we want digital capabilities to service individuals who are more
focused on a full digital relationship. As part of achieving these goals, in 2016 alone, we negotiated over 10 alliances
with industry-leading digital providers. You will hear a lot more about this throughout the year.
Slide 13 then summarizes the growth opportunities in Wealth Management. Together with an improving U.S. economy,
moderating revenue headwinds, execution of both our revenue and expense initiatives, as well as structural savings
from the Smith Barney transaction, all of these serve as a powerful combination to achieve our margin targets in 2017
and beyond.
I'd now like to spend a few moments addressing Investment Management. Slide 14 outlines the business. As a
reminder, the business has approximately $400 billion in assets under management with world-class expertise in a
number of segments, including our real assets, portfolio solutions, liquidity, and global equity businesses. In the fall of
2015, we asked Dan Simkowitz to run the business, reporting directly to me.
Throughout 2016, we undertook an organizational realignment aimed to unify the business, rationalize costs, and better
take advantage of the firm's distribution and origination platforms. We've also positioned ourselves for growth by
launching new products such as our ultra-short bond fund and have had strong momentum in fundraising across a
number of funds, including private infrastructure and real estate.
Finally, in 2016, we dealt with what I would describe as legacy cleanups to the business. In the fourth quarter, we sold
or marked down a number of third-party LP fund positions from the 2005 to 2007 period. Jon will walk through the
associated costs in a moment.
I am confident that the business will move forward on a more stable footing. In the medium to long term, we continue
to see opportunities for growth which you will hear more about throughout the year.
Let's now turn to the final slide of the presentation. Over the past few years, we've consistently increased our dividend
and significantly increased our total payout to approximately $5 billion while also growing our common equity base.
We believe we are more than sufficiently capitalized for our business mix as well as for our size and risk profile. Strong
capital return is a critical element of our future success.
Thank you for listening. Now let me turn it back to Jon who will discuss our fourth quarter results, and then together,
we will take your questions.
Jonathan Pruzan
Thank you, James, and good morning.
The fourth quarter was solid, demonstrating continued consistency and progress against the 2017 plan we outlined last
year. In a quarter that is typically characterized by a slowdown across several of our businesses during the holiday
season, we generated the highest quarterly revenues for the year.
Firm revenues of $9 billion were up modestly compared to Q3, making the third consecutive quarter with revenues of
approximately $9 billion. In the fourth quarter, PBT was $2.2 billion, EPS was $0.81, and ROE was 8.7%.
Our results in the quarter benefited from net discrete tax benefits of $135 million. These tax benefits were largely offset
by other discrete items in Wealth Management and Investment Management which I will discuss shortly.
For the fourth quarter, noninterest expenses were $6.8 billion. Typical fourth quarter seasonality and professional
services contributed to the sequential elevation.
For the full year, non-compensation expenses are down approximately $700 million. Total noninterest expenses are
down a little less than $900 million for the year. While some of the expense reduction was attributable to our business
mix, Project Streamline initiatives accounted for the vast majority of these savings.

As you know with Project Streamline, last year, we committed to reducing $1 billion of expenses by 2017 assuming
flat revenues. The targeted reduction was driven by three core levers: support services efficiencies, compensation
discipline, and normalized litigation.
As it relates to support services, we continue to make progress in our workforce strategy, taking advantage of
technology as appropriate. We have thoroughly reviewed our vendor relationships, identifying and executing
consolidation opportunities that resulted in synergies and rate reductions. We have noticeably reduced marketing and
business development costs by actively managing discretionary spending combined with price renegotiations. We
continue to benefit from shutting down the two North American data centers and remain on track to close two
additional ones next year.
And finally, where we have rightsized certain businesses, we have also rightsized related support groups. Further, we
have discontinued services and associated non-compensation costs tied to these reductions.
In addition to support services efficiencies, we remain disciplined around compensation, and litigation expenses have
also decreased year-over-year. As we look forward to 2017, we are well on our way to executing the roughly 200
expense initiatives we identified. Importantly, we are focused on keeping these costs permanently out of the expense
base.
Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities franchise performed well in Q4. All three of our major business
lines produced strong results with total net revenues of $4.6 billion essentially flat to the third quarter.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 11% sequentially, mainly driven by seasonality and
execution-related costs. Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion, bringing our full year ISG compensation to net
revenue ratio to 36% compared to approximately 37% last year excluding DVA.
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.3 million in revenue, a 15% increase over the third quarter. The increase was
driven by continued strength in advisory and a rebound in Fixed Income underwriting revenues, partially offset by
lower equity underwriting revenues. For 2016, we are number two globally in IPOs, announced M&A, completed
M&A, as well as equity and equity-linked offerings. Going into 2017, the overall Investment Banking pipelines remain
healthy. Capital markets are open and functioning with increased investor optimism post-election. It is too early to tell
whether the optimism will translate into conviction allowing us to pull deals from our pipeline into the market.
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $628 million, up 25% versus 3Q 2016; and at $2.2 billion, they were up 13%
for the full year. In an environment where growth continues to be challenged, clients are engaged in strategic dialogues
and executing on meaningful transactions.
Turning to underwriting. The difficult environment for equity underwriting observed throughout the year continued
into the fourth quarter. Revenues were $225 million, down 5% versus 3Q 2016. Several political events such as the
U.S. election and the Italian referendum along with actions by the FMOC (sic) [FOMC], ECB, and OPEC contributed
to conservatism by issuers and investors throughout the quarter. Specifically, in IPOs, while activity generally picked
up after the first quarter, volumes in 2016 were down 35%.
Fixed Income underwriting revenues increased 16% sequentially to $421 million, driven by strength in high yield and a
pick-up in event lending. As previously discussed, we tend to perform better in markets where we see more
non-commoditized debt products and activity. Looking ahead, both investment-grade and high-yield markets continue
to be open to issuers and we expect to see healthy activity in 2017.
Sales and Trading revenues were flat sequentially, weathering seasonal trends, demonstrating strong and consistent
performance throughout the quarter. In equities, we expect to finish number one globally for the third consecutive year
with annual revenues again exceeding $8 billion. In the fourth quarter, revenues were just under $2 billion, up 4%
versus the third quarter. Performance was strong across all products and regions.
Revenues in the Americas had particularly strong growth as investor optimism and trading activity improved after the
election. As a consequence, cash equities were higher sequentially as market volumes increased. Compared to most
fourth quarters, derivatives withstood recent seasonal trends and demonstrated strength throughout the year. In Fixed

Income Sales and Trading, we continue to build on momentum from the prior two quarters. Q4 revenues of just under
$1.5 billion were seasonally strong and essentially unchanged from the third quarter. Idiosyncratic events resulted in
active trading environment.
Quarter over quarter, our macro businesses benefited from increased volumes and rates and repositioning in FX as the
markets repriced the path for U.S. monetary and fiscal policy following the election. Credit saw a sequential decrease
as activity was slower than the third quarter, although the general environment remained relatively benign. Fixed
Income RWAs and SLR exposure ex-lending were $117 billion and $339 billion, respectively, on December 31. As
James discussed, we are managing our Sales and Trading business holistically and are sharing and optimizing resources
as appropriate. Accordingly, going forward, we will no longer report individual RWA and SLR targets for Fixed
Income.
Full revenues for Fixed Income of $5.1 billion, up 19% versus 2015, are the highest since 2012 ex-DVA. The
comparison is more favorable when taking into account the sale of our Oil Merchanting business in 4Q 2015. Lastly,
average trading VAR for the quarter was $39 million, down versus $42 million last quarter. We continue to take
advantage in periods of market liquidity to derisk our balance sheet. This provides us with an opportunity to prudently
raise VAR if accretive client opportunities present themselves.
Now, turning to Wealth Management. We reported record net revenues of $4 billion and annualized revenue per FA is
over $1 million for the first time. The PBT margin was 22%, negatively impacted by a provision in connection with
certain brokerage tax reporting issues. We saw strong client flows of $17 billion. Fee-based assets increased 3% to
$877 billion and now represent 42% of client assets, both are at respective highs. Total client assets now stand at $2.1
trillion and this positions us well going into 2017. Asset management revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter,
further building our base of annuitized revenues.
Net interest income was up 11% sequentially. The increase was attributable to both loan growth and lower prepayment
amortization. Bank lending balances were up approximately $3 billion quarter-over-quarter, ending the year at $60
billion. Over the last year, net interest income growth of 19% was primarily driven by our deposit deployment strategy
and lending growth. Looking ahead, we would expect further NII growth but expect a more balanced contribution from
deposit deployment and interest rates.
Transactional activity benefited from the strength in the back half of the quarter, as retail investors reentered the
market, driving stronger commission revenues. This was partially offset by a continued subdued equity underwriting
calendar. Total transaction revenues were $774 million, down 2% versus 3Q but up when excluding the impact of
mark-to-market losses on our deferred compensation plans.
Non-compensation expenses were up 13% in the quarter. The aforementioned provision and seasonality contributed to
the increase. The compensation ratio was 56.5% on a full-year basis, on track to meet our 2017 objective of at or below
56%. The execution of our expense initiatives has allowed us to continue to invest in our infrastructure, our digital
capabilities, and readiness for future regulatory developments while simultaneously improving our margins.
In Investment Management, total net revenues were $500 million, down 9% quarter-over-quarter. The business
reported asset management fees of $512 million and AUM of $417 billion, both essentially unchanged versus 3Q.
Investment revenues in the quarter were negative $24 million, which included a loss of approximately $60 million
associated with the sales and markdowns of non-strategic third-party LP investments. Overall expenses were up 4%
quarter-over-quarter. Following updated guidance from the Federal Reserve at the end of 2016, we will apply for
additional extensions for essentially all of our investments in legacy covered funds, subject to the Volcker Rule.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total and average assets remained relatively flat at $811 billion and $821 billion,
respectively. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $371 billion,
essentially flat to the third quarter. Our capital position remains strong. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III
advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio stayed flat at 15.8%. Our pro forma fully phased -in supplementary leverage ratio
for the quarter increased to 6.3%.

During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of common stock, or approximately 27 million shares, and our
board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. For the full year, we repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock, or
approximately 117 million shares, compared with $2.1 billion, or approximately 59 million shares in 2015.
Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 25.2%, including the $135 million net discrete tax benefit. For the full year,
excluding net discrete items, our tax rate was approximately 32%. As Wealth Management continues to become a
larger percentage of our BPT, we would expect our tax rate to drift higher towards 33% in 2017, and we would expect
our tax rate to continue to exhibit quarter-to-quarter volatility. Of course, all of this is subject to U.S. corporate tax
reform.
As James discussed, we started 2016 with five strategic objectives to be achieved over two years, and we have made
solid progress on all of them. We are on track to achieve our 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. Although the revenue
environment was challenging in first quarter of the year, we were able to position ourselves well for 2017 and beyond.
We did this by improving our cost discipline and executing strategic initiatives including our bank strategy and our
Fixed Income restructuring, while retaining leadership positions in areas of traditional strength of Equities and
Investment Banking.
Recently, increased investor optimism and more constructive markets are positive signs for our businesses. As always,
changes in macro and geopolitical factors can have meaningful impact to market sentiment, but for now, we are
encouraged by the increased confidence of market participants.
With that, we will open the line to questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Your line is
now open.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Hey, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: As you pointed out, you met a lot of your objectives for the year. And I guess it points to the
question specifically in Fixed Income, given that you've maintained that target at $4 billion, or $1 billion quarterly, and
even in what was a terrible year last year, you managed $4.3 billion, I think, and this year, you did $5.1 billion. It begs
the question of whether you wouldn't raise your sights on that.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Guy, these were targets we put in place a year ago for 2017. We've seen a lot of cycles
in Fixed Income. We've had a lot of people questioning our strategy over the last several years. I think we feel pretty
good about what we did in restructuring the business. I think the new team, bringing it together with equities obviously
was a very positive move there. And we'd just like to see it play out a little bit. There's no point getting ahead of
ourselves at this point. Most of our peer companies do not put out such specific goals as we do, and I don't feel like we
should be updating them every year. Let's see it play out.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, fair enough. By the same token, looking at slide 13, where you show you've got a 23%
to 25% margin target in Wealth Management and then you've got a question mark on 2018 and 2019, it looks as if
you've drawn the 2018 bar a bit higher though. Maybe you can give us the thought process there and what you might
aspire to by the end of the year.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: You have remarkably good eyesight, Guy. I had not noticed that graphic detail. I think
it's fair to say, if you took this chart back even further, our pre-tax margin in the mid-2005 – 2006 range was around
3%. The scale economics of the business are unshakable, and building out the bank side has obviously given it a huge
kicker.

What's been missing has been the retail investor. What has been missing has been the new issue calendar in the last
several months, and what has been missing has been interest rates. If those things happen, just from the position we're
in now, we feel obviously strongly about the target for this year. If those things happen, there's obviously additional
upside, and that's exactly right. That's what the question marks were meant to evidence. Not exactly the line on the
graph, but I take your point. We feel as good about this business as we've felt for a long, long time.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough, and thanks for that. And maybe I can just follow up on one of the items that you
mentioned there in terms of interest rate sensitivity. Your interest rate sensitivity disclosure feels somewhat
mechanistic; it's just on the bank. And I was wondering if you had maybe a more holistic view for Wealth Management
in particular as to what, say, a parallel shift in the yield curve of 25 or 50 basis points should do, all other things equal,
for the Wealth Management business.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Let me try to take that one, Guy. I think, as you point out, the Wealth business and the NII in
that business is clearly the most sensitive to rates. I think last year, we told you that the growth in NII – and I can't
remember what slide it is, but we showed you that in Wealth, it went from $3 billion to $3.5 billion, that that was really
driven by deposit deployment and the growth in the lending balances.
I think what we're saying for 2017 is that we would still expect NII growth, albeit at a somewhat slower pace, and it's
probably going to be more mixed in terms of where that comes from. We still have some room to play out in the
deposit deployment strategy. We still feel good about our lending balances. They went from $48 billion to $60 billion.
We would expect to continue to grow the loan balances. Clearly, mortgage will probably slow down a little bit given
the increase in rates, but SBL and the tailored lending product continues to show good growth. So we'll see some
average earning asset growth that will drive that.
And then, lastly, this year we do expect to get a little bit of a lift from rates, particularly as the forward curve is
realized. I can't exactly remember, but in first quarter of 2016 I think the forward curve was showing maybe one or half
a rate increase. Now we obviously have two rate increases. And to the degree that those get realized, that will clearly
help that NII line in Wealth.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Sure.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura. Your
line is now open.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Hi, good morning. So I wanted to ask a follow-up relating to, Jon, your last remarks
concerning ROE targets for 2017. You've previously indicated at the last strategic update that hitting the 9% was really
contingent on delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth per year, and it looks like consensus is modeling somewhere
closer to low single digit, so instead of your 3% to 5%, somewhere closer to 2%. But given the significant progress
you've made on the cost side, I'm just wondering you can still hit the 9% even if revenue outlook materializes more in
line with consensus.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. I think if you recall one of the slides, we started with a 7% ROE. We said $1 billion of
expenses should add about 100 basis points of ROE, and therefore, the revenue growth was going to generate the
difference. We still feel very good about the target. We still have more progress to make on the expense side and we
would expect to keep those expenses out of the business, so the operational leverage on those revenues is pretty good.
So again, I think in light of the last three quarters that we put up close to $9 billion and as James said, on average about
an 8.5% ROE, we see a clear line of sight that 9% to 11%, and we feel pretty confident about it.

<Q - Steven Chubak>: Got it, and just one quick follow-up relating to the Wealth Management comp guidance you
guys have given. Just looking at the business, the comp ratio did tick down slightly this year, about 50 bps, so
continuing to grind that lower. But admittedly, the mix, particularly towards higher margin NII, would have suggested
that maybe we should have seen a little bit more progress. And, James, you actually alluded to some of the competitive
dynamics in your prepared remarks that could drive intensifying competition. But I just want to get a sense as to what
factors have impacted your ability to drive more meaningful comp leverage, and maybe how much incremental margin
upside we could see from higher rates, alluding to Guy's question about the rising column chart in terms of margin
progress beyond 2017.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, in terms of the rate question, I'll answer that. We did increase NII $500 million in that
business – or more than $500 million in that business last year. We would expect to continue to grow NII. It's obviously
a bigger number, and so growth rates will slow down, but we feel very good about the margin and the net interest
income opportunity and that will clearly drive an increase in our margin. We were at 22-and-change for the year, so
again we have clear line of sight into that 23% to 25% level.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Just on the comp ratio quickly, I think it's clearly encouraging. It's heading in the
direction that we all want. At the same time, we are making some investments in the business. I mean, the bank
build-out is critical and we've got to be careful that we're not penny wise and pound foolish here. We need to invest
behind the bank. We need to invest behind that digital strategy. We need to invest behind upgrading the technology in
the branch system, and we've been investing behind our marketing efforts there. So, while we could probably accelerate
the comp ratio decline, I'm not sure that would be good for the medium, long-term growth of the business, which we're
all focused on at the same time
<Q - Steven Chubak>: And how far along are you in terms of those investments? Are they largely completed at this
point, or should we expect that to be ongoing?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: No. I don't want to overstate them. They're just – it's part and parcel of running the
business. And you're always investing in your business. The business mix itself will dictate a decline in the comp ratio
as will further growth, because the incremental expense costs on the further revenue growth are obviously relatively
attractive.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Thanks so much for taking my questions.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Sure.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. I just want a clarification. Your ROE target of 9% to 11% is for the calendar year 2017 and it's
not contingent on anything right now. You're committed to getting that ROE?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Mike, I think when we set that target and we stand by it, it was contingent upon three
things, as you'll recall. I think it was the last page of the presentation a year ago. One of them was 3% to 5% revenue
growth. One of them was continued progress on our capital return because obviously, ROE is a function of both the
equity and the earnings. And the third was no onetime large enforcement/litigation financial crisis type events.
This year we saw zero revenue growth or maybe 1%, I think. We saw no one-time large/enforcement litigation events,
and we were able to increase our capital, but we still accreted capital, interestingly, even with our capital increase.
We're not at 100% payout. We're confident we'll be above 9%. Obviously, if there's a very difficult revenue
environment this year, we stand by our original projections it was subject to. And I don't think we're going to need to be
at the 3% to 5% revenue growth to get there, but certainly if we had negative revenue environment, that would be a
different issue.

<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then as far as your progress in trading, you're gaining market share in equities for sure and it
looks like a little bit in Fixed Income. Is that from U.S. banks or European banks? And if it's in European banks, is that
sustainable?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: So, Mike, yes. I mean we are – as you said, we put up over $8 billion in equities and $5
billion in Fixed Income. The equity pool in terms of the revenue where the wallet looks like it will shrink for the year;
we haven't seen everyone's results yet. And we have the opposite phenomenon in Fixed Income where it looks like
there's – the pools have been getting a little bit bigger sort of quarter-to-quarter.
In terms of where that share is coming from, it's sort of hard to discern, but I would say one of the things that we've
been very proud of and very focused on is keeping the global network intact as we restructured and changed our
businesses around the globe. And I think that global network is accruing benefits to us as we've seen others around the
globe sort of disrupted or distracted based on events going on. So, unclear if it's coming from any particular competitor,
but we do feel good about the shares that we have and the momentum we have in those businesses.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then last follow-up. James, you mentioned a 10-year retentions goal for Wealth Management
personnel. Can you just summarize what that's about and when that could impact results?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: When we did the deal, Mike, in – I believe it was closed in the early – mid-January of
2009, we did the deal, we put in place a retention program which is not uncommon for these kinds of transactions,
particular when you're moving financial advisors across platforms and creating a reasonable amount of disruption at
that point in time. And we moved all of the financial advisors ultimately onto a new platform; those from the original
Dean Witter franchise, those from Morgan Stanley and those from Smith Barney. The net impact was several thousand
financial advisors at that point were given a deal, a retention deal, depending on size of business, shape sort of the
nature of the deal. It's amortized over nine years, I believe, 9 or 10 years. I think it's nine years.
The last year of amortization, the expiration of it is in January of 2018, if memory serves me. So...
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: 2019.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Maybe it's 2019.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: We'll clarify that. I think it's 2019. So, we've got two years left of the nine-year deal.
Some of those financial advisors, in the meantime, have retired; a small number have moved on to other employment.
So, the annual amortization rate is probably not exactly the same year-by-year, but it's a meaningful number. We finish
with that in two years' time. We've been paying it for seven years so far and we've got two years left, but then it's done.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right, thank you.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thanks. On the $17 billion of fee-based flows, I'm curious if there's any new client money in
there or is that all a result of conversion of current client? And within that, I'm curious if that's just all natural
progression as you've basically doubled the fee-based assets over the last seven years and where you think that natural
resting ground will be as DOL may be coming into play in a couple of months?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. I think – to the first question, it is a mix of both some new assets as well as existing
assets. I think – we've always said that we think there's a secular trend going on here long term that people are moving
toward fee-based accounts and want to have that choice or use that mechanism as an account level as opposed to in a

brokerage account.
So this is a trend, as you said, that we've seen for quite some time. We would expect it to continue. We're now at 42%
of client assets are in fee-based accounts. We continue to believe that that number can go higher and expect it to drift
higher as time continues to play out. What the natural or what the ending point is, is unclear, but we still think there is
room above 42%.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: While we're on that topic, let's just say that DOL goes as planned, meaning there's no dilution,
there's no delay, does the April 10 deadline – is that an event that changes behavior ahead of it on this fee-based
discussion or is it just natural progression – the date is just the start date?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think it's hard to sort of parse out why people are changing. We're clearly positioned to be
in compliance with the rule if it goes into effect on April 10. What we've always said is we want to give our clients
choice, so they will have choice to either move into a fee-based account or stay. And, therefore, this is about sort of
client preference and we'll have to see how it plays out.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question, one quick one here on ROE, or
actually it might not be all that quick. So, I get it that there is some uncertainty in the revenue environment, but you
guys highlighted it seems like momentum continues to improve. Specifically, FICC looks stable, exceeding targets with
lower capital, equity is strong, NII's starting to benefit from rate uplift, and risk appetite is expanding, and transactional
revenues are starting to improve in Wealth Management. And then finally, we've got the outlook for potential changes
from a new administration that's highlighted regulation and the desire to cut back. So, in light of all of that, how should
we think about the ROE guide? It certainly seems like the low end, given those factors, would be quite easy for you.
And how should we think about that new administration and potential benefits from lesser regulatory burdens?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Brennan, I think you outlaid the bull case. The bear case would be the retail investor
doesn't engage. There's a geopolitical or political event which creates enough confusion in the minds of potential
issuers that the underwriting calendar doesn't come back. The M&A pipeline, for whatever reason, is crystallized given
some of the changes on the political front including potential tax reform, et cetera, et cetera.
So, listen, we're all working hard here to get the ROE up higher. We have been explicit in setting a range and a
timeframe for that range. Again, I don't know that, that has been common practice among our competitor set, but we
did it. And we're very comfortable with that range. So, if we have the high-class problem you've laid out, which we all
hope we do, terrific. We'll generate a higher return than we might've estimated at the low end, but let's see that play out
over time.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Société Générale. Your line is now open.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if we could return to the NII
sensitivity. It would be nice to get some measure of how much your NII would improve for, say, a 100 basis point
parallel upward shift in the curve. I think you did something along those lines in the 1Q Fixed Income presentation last
year, so perhaps you can give an update on that? And then just together with that, perhaps give a sense of how sensitive
you are to the short end increasing versus the long end. Are you predominantly sensitive to short end increasing and
then hoping that that short end increases in tandem with what the curve is indicating?
And then, sorry, just a second question, if I may. Your CET1 ratio was virtually unchanged in the quarter despite the
strong earnings and I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about any negative AOCI impacts coming from

negative debt valuation adjustments. Could you also talk about how you view excess capital? I think everyone is on the
same page as seeing you as having a lot of excess capital but the question mark is how much. What are you waiting for
in terms of having that return to shareholders more clarity on the regulatory front, maybe the stressed capital buffer
becoming more a tangible part of capital ratios. If you could talk about that a bit more, that would be great.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Hey, Andrew. That's a lot of questions for one question and glad to see where you
came out with your recent research. I'm going to let Jon answer maybe one of these and we can follow up offline.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I'll pick one. So I think as you know, on the capital return, we just resubmitted our CCAR
submission. We'll wait to hear back from them. We continue to increase our capital return. In our disclosure, you can
see what we have in parent capital and we would like to continue – as our earnings grow, we would like to continue to
return more capital to shareholders.
The second point I would make on your Tier 1, I think, was your CET1 question is just around we had our buyback and
our preferred and common dividend sort of offset our earnings and then you saw a movement in our AOCI. We have a
$60 billion AFS portfolio throughout the organization and that cost about a $700 million, give or take, after-tax impact.
So, all the earnings, net of the buybacks and dividends and AOCI sort of ended up in a flat place.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your
line is now open.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: All right. Thanks, guys. Just a few on Wealth Management and some of these are just
cleanups but I think, Jon, you mentioned some expense items in this quarter I think it was related something on tax,
some tax issues but I just wanted to make sure we have that amount if you had it. And then on the net interest income,
like, any color on just given the strength in the quarter, how much was maybe non-core like prepayments, stuff like
that. And I think in the past you've mentioned I think it was 150 basis points was like $1.1 billion PBT but any update
just on the sensitivity there?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I'd go backwards, I don't recall the $1.1 billion comment, so I don't think that came from me.
In terms of the other questions – I'm sorry.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: It was just the expense item. I think you mentioned there was something in Wealth
Management.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think as you can see, from the non-comp expenses that gives you a sense of sort of the
magnitude. The full-year PBT was 22%. We feel good about the 23% to 25% margin in that business going forward.
And we took a provision this quarter to address those issues that we've identified. What was the other question? I'm
sorry.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Yes, that was fine. I just didn't know if you sized it. And then the other one was just on
the rate sensitivity.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, I think we feel good about our rate position. We are asset-sensitive. Duration in the
bank is still – if you look at the bank in totality, it's still under two years. We saw one increase at the end of 2015. We
saw one increase at the end of 2016, so we have started to get a little bit of uplift in terms of the return on our cash and
on our short-term securities.
The mortgage origination pipeline is still pretty good. The new mortgages are being written at higher rates, so we'll get
the benefit of that. The duration in that portfolio extended a little bit out. But again, we feel good about NII growth in
the bank. You will see that in the results in the Wealth Management business that we've taken that number from under
$2 billion a couple years ago to $3.5 billion in NII, and we would expect that to continue to grow. And that will
obviously help the margin in that business.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, James, Jon, a couple quick ones here. So in Wealth Management,
just want to follow up on James's comment about one leg of the strategy as a move towards focusing on clients that are
interested in a full digital relationship. I'm just curious if we should think about that as maybe expanding the customer
base to smaller levels of investable assets just because those will become more economic. I'm just trying to think about
what that comment means.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I think that there has obviously been an evolution in this industry, and there are clear
market segments. The vast majority of clients that we deal with and aspire to deal with are people who are attracted to
the intellectual capital and product offerings that a firm like Morgan Stanley has. So we have disproportionately much
larger households among our $2 trillion – $2.1 trillion of assets, a very large percentage of them in households above
$10 million and again, between $1 million and $10 million.
That said, we're building a lot of digital technology to support the financial advisors and the branch operations in
delivering online capability and services to those clients. At the same time, there are clients who want to deal with a
digital-only platform, and we're reserving the option to serve that client base. We don't think in the certainly short,
medium, maybe even long term it's going to be a large part of our business. That's not our presumption. We're not a
pure online or direct player, but we have that capability. I think the biggest opportunity, however, exists with providing
online capability to existing clients who want a multichannel relationship with us.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Got it. Okay, that's great color. And then just staying on PWM, it looks like a slight downtick in
FA head count. On the other hand, you had it looks like a record quarter of productivity, which was good to see. I'm
just curious if we can get any thoughts around FA head count trends from here, the outlook for recruiting. I suspect
maybe the DOL has had a load of negative impact on that, but curious where we go from here.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Listen, I think, as you know, the FA head count bounces around a little bit. I think we're
comfortable with the levels that we are at, and it probably is in and around this level. We have seen a slowdown in
recruiting both in terms of ins and outs. The net impact has been a little bit, as you see here, a little bit of attrition. But
again, I think this is a level that we're comfortable with, and the recruiting environment has certainly slowed down over
the last couple quarters here.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. So my question is basically about the levers in which capital can be
more fully optimized. And I guess the two parts of my question are on the one hand, as long as the CCAR process
exists, obviously there will be constraints on how much capital presumably can be returned in any given period of time.
And on the other hand, you've right-sized your FICC footprint, and so it's now consuming less RWA than it has
historically. So is there anything that can be done in which RWA can be generated in a way that consumes this capital
and accretes then to revenue that's different than what the current experience is?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: The way I would think about it is as we generate capital, we've said we have sufficient
capital, so we'd like to keep it stable. To the degree it accretes, which it did accrete over the course of the year, we can
try to continue to support our client base. We have capital capacity to increase our balance sheet if the opportunity
presents itself, so that's certainly an opportunity that we haven't seen in the past.
Clearly, over the last couple years, our balance sheet has been flat to down. But as we see some increased activity in
client activity across the globe, there's an opportunity to invest that back into our core businesses. So that's another area
that potentially looks like there could be an opportunity this year, whereas I would say last year, it didn't feel like we
were in that same spot.

<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it, so that was actually my follow-up. It sounds like in 2017, you think there might be a
bit more opportunity for balance sheet growth.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, I think we entered this year with more of a half-full optimism as opposed to if you
recall in the first quarter of last year when we set out these targets and these guidelines, we were in a very different and
difficult environment and it was a very much half-empty environment with disruption and not really functioning
markets. Today, markets are open and functioning, and there is this new sense of optimism. So if that continues, there
should be potentially opportunity to increase the size of the balance sheet.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hi, good afternoon. I had two questions. The first one was in the past, Morgan Stanley has
talked about the deposit beta within Wealth Management and I remember a number of 45 basis points for 100 basis
points. I wondered whether you could update us on that and whether that's changed because sometimes, you've talked
about it.
And the second area was Brexit strategy. I wondered if you could talk again about where you're going on that front and
what your options could be if there is, as it looks like, a single-market exit. Thank you.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. On the beta question, there's obviously been a lot of discussion around betas, mostly
because we're now in an environment of rising rates where we haven't seen one in eight years. So everyone is using
models that are based on historical practices, and we obviously have seen also money market reform and some changes
in the structure of the market.
I would say in terms of how we think about our beta today, Fiona, again, I think my comments have generally been that
we think the beta is about 50 basis points, and I think we still are comfortable that that's a reasonable estimate. Realized
betas on the first two hikes have clearly been lower, but we think 50 is probably as good as estimate as any, and we'll
have to see how it plays out and what actually happens to rates.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Just on Brexit, Fiona, I think given the PM's speech this morning, we probably need a
little time to digest. This is a bit of a moving chessboard here. We like the UK. We like the rule of law in the UK. We
like having our businesses there, and our aspiration is to keep much of our business there as possible. But to the extent
we have to comply with obviously the Brexit rules, we'll be putting our headquarters somewhere in Continental Europe,
and that will have some implications going forward but it's a little early this month. Let's digest what she said this
morning, and we'll be meeting with them over the next week or so.

positioned for rising rates including the Institutional Securities unit and Investment Management, just thinking about
the aggregate balance sheet.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think that most or virtually most of that sensitivity is in Wealth and will sort of be seen in
that segment reporting Wealth line. The Institutional Securities business as you've tracked in the segment reporting NII
is not really how we think about that business and sort of how it plays out in light of the sales and trading nature of the

business. Broadly speaking, rising rates in terms of what that is as a function of global growth rates and/or volatility
will impact the Sales and Trading business, but again, most of the sensitivity lies within our Wealth business because
most of the assets outside of Wealth are floating rate assets matched with floating rate liabilities.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then the follow-up just in the Institutional Securities, we saw the net
interest income there go down, but is that more just a mix shift in terms of how clients are paying more in fees versus
the interest income or is there more of a liability-sensitive position there?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, I think it's very hard to look at net interest income and ISG particularly the Sales and
Trading businesses. As you know, we're carrying inventories, we're trading positions. NII has created a lot of different
ways. It's not really how we look at that business. So, the Wealth is the real area you will see impact.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I think we're going to take a couple more questions. We're running a little overtime
here, but given there's been a long queue, we'll take a couple more and then we'll shut it down.
Operator
Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital. Your line is now open.
<Q - Dick X. Bove>: Thank you. You had a very impressive quarter in terms of earnings growth clearly in the fourth
quarter. But at the end of the day, your common equity was down, which has been true of every one of the major
universal banks. And I'm just wondering, if interest rates are expected to rise on a continuous basis, I guess, certainly
2017 and beyond, how do you get common equity to go up?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: So, how do we get common equity go up, we're actually trying to keep common equity flat
as we think we have sufficient capital to run our businesses based on the current size, shape, and risk profile of the
company. We have been increasing our capital return to try to achieve that. As you point out, this quarter, we were
impacted by a movement in our AFS portfolio as well as some movements in DDA as our credit spreads tightened.
Those movements are going to be volatile depending on what happens to rates and what happens to spreads. But again,
our goal here is to try to keep capital pretty flat going forward.
<Q - Dick X. Bove>: But if interest rates keep rising and if the impact is similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter,
your common equity is going to continue to fall. And if your common equity continues to fall, in answer to an earlier
question, you indicated that you'd be able to expand the size of the balance sheet to take advantage of new
opportunities. But you won't be able to do that if you can't get common equity to stabilize or rise in a rising interest rate
environment. In other words, you may be able to get an increased benefit in terms of asset sensitivity from some of
your business lines. But from the balance sheet as a whole, the piggy bank is smaller today or in, let's say, December 31
than it was on September 30. How do people benefit if the piggy bank keeps getting smaller?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, I think we did accrete average capital and absolute capital over the course of 2016.
We started the beginning of the year 2016 saying that we were capital sufficient, so we have more capital than when we
made those comments so we can continue to leverage that capital. Our average equity was down $400 million I think
quarter-over-quarter. So, again, on a roughly $70 billion base, it wasn't a dramatic decline. We still have more capital
today than we did at December 31. And we continue to believe we have capital capacity to invest in our business and
grow our business.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Thanks for taking my question. Two relatively quick ones, I hope. First of all, Jon, in
Investment Management, obviously, the fourth quarter numbers were a little bit skewed by the loss. But first of all, can

you tell us a little more detail as to why you took those charges? And in the bigger picture, you're still above the 40%
target for comp to net revenues in that business. How confident are you, you can get to that by 2017?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: All right. Let me take the first one first. As we said, these were non-core investments. They
were capital intensive. They were limited partner investments. This was money that we didn't manage nor had we
invested. They were investments that were made going on 10 years ago when we made the risk decision to exit those
positions, and we did and sort of took the charge that you saw in the fourth quarter of $60 million. So, absent that
charge obviously, a better result in that business: stable asset fees, stable asset management fees and would have been a
better investment line was it not for that charge that we took. And again, those were decisions based on – risk decisions
that we decided to exit those positions.
In terms of the comp ratio, to be fair, as you know, carry runs through that line item. So, the comp ratio target that we
put out there, it's really quite volatile. And I don't think we're going to – depending on what the investment environment
is, it's sort of reversed. If we have a lot of carry gains, we won't meet our target, yet our income will be a lot higher. So,
that target is probably one that we won't meet, depending on the investment environment. The one thing I will tell you
is that if you look at – you don't have the ability to parse this through the different line items, but the non-carry related
comp expense is actually down as a percentage of the fee-based revenue, so we are exhibiting good expense discipline
in that business, but it will be volatile based on carry and investment gains. So, not a great target that we had out there
and probably one that we're just going to be focused on the discipline around the non-carry related comp.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now
open.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning. You guys have made great progress on the FICC RWA. I think almost at
your end state already, well ahead of schedule. Just before I guess you stopped disclosing it, can you just kind of walk
us through on the SLR side? I think you still are less than halfway to your end state. Why is that slower than the FICC,
the RWA side? And is the end state still your target? And how do we get there?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, from the slide that James put up, when we announced the restructuring, we've taken
the FICC RWAs down from 158 to below 120, which, as you said, was our 2017 target. SLR, we've also made some
great progress from 417 down into the 340s. I think the difference you're seeing, obviously, more liquid products. So,
in terms of leverage assets versus RWA, that's one of the drivers. We feel good about the size of this business. We feel
good about the results of this business. And again, we're going to still manage this business aggressively, but we're just
not going to be releasing those individual targets as we think that the size of this business is appropriate.
<Q - James Mitchell>: So, what you're saying is where you are from an SLR perspective today is you're not going to
get much more progress from here?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: No, I'm saying we're going to continue to try to make progress in those line items, and we
feel good that there are probably some more opportunities. We have taken them down pretty dramatically from the 417
into the 340s, so we think there is still some optimization there, but we feel good about the size of this business and the
results that it generated.
