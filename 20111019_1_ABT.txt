MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the
question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the
exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the
question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's
expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and
Public Affairs.
John B. Thomas
Thanks, Alane [ph]. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.
Today we're going be discussing two important Abbott news events: first, our announcement to separate into two
independent, publicly-traded companies, one in diversified medical products and the other in research-based
pharmaceuticals; and second, we'll be talking about our strong third quarter ongoing earnings results.
Joining me on today's call is Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, our
Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; Rick Gonzalez, Executive Vice President, Global
Pharmaceuticals; and Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations.
Miles and Rick will review the strategic rationale related to our announcement this morning as well as provide an
overview of each of these new companies and their investment identities. Tom will discuss certain financial aspects and
conclude with a brief review of our third quarter results, which we've summarized today to allow for sufficient time to
discuss today's other major announcement. Details on our third quarter can be found in our earnings news release.
Following our comments today of course we'll take any questions you have, as always.

I'd also note that we posted a 12-page slide deck to our Abbott website this morning at www.abbottinvestor.com and
this deck summarizes the details of our announcement this morning regarding the separation.
In addition this morning, I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting a two-hour investor meeting this coming
Friday in New York. Miles, Rick Gonzalez, Tom Freyman, as well as Dr. John Leonard, our Head of Pharmaceutical
Research and Development, will be in attendance along with myself, Larry and some other people from our Investor
Relations and Media department.
At Friday's meeting we'll discuss the growth opportunities in Abbott's diversified medical products business as well as
growth opportunities in the research-based pharmaceutical company. We're going to walk you through the
pharmaceutical pipeline in more detail, and we'll spotlight certain programs that we're particularly enthused about,
including early data from our HCV trials. And Rick will talk more about that in a minute.
So given that you're going to hear from us this coming Friday, we're going to try to limit and focus our call today and
try to keep it to approximately an hour.
Before we get started, let me remind you that some statements may be forward-looking including the planned
separation of the research-based pharmaceutical company from the diversified medical products company and the
expected financial results of the two companies after separation.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual
results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And there is no assurance as to the
timing of the planned separation or whether it will be completed.
Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed
in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on a Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2010, and in the interim reports filed on Form 10-Q for subsequent quarterly periods. Abbott undertakes
no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or
developments.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release as well as regulatory filings from today, which will be available
on our website at abbott.com.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Miles. Miles?
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning. As you can see from our strong third quarter results, Abbott delivered another
quarter of strong performance across our mix of businesses. Our ongoing earnings per share growth was more than
12%, as we've now posted double-digit growth in 17 of our last 18 quarters. We'll generate similar performance for the
full year, which will again place us among the top performers in our peer group. So we're pleased with our consistent
financial performance, but as evidenced by today's other important news, we're taking a significant next step in aligning
our long-term strategic goals with our shareholders' best interests.
Today's announcement to separate into two publicly traded companies in diversified medical products and
research-based pharmaceuticals is a logical step in the further evolution of our company. Over the past 12 years our
actions have dramatically reshaped Abbott. Let me give you some background and examples. Since 1998, Abbott has
nearly quadrupled in revenues to nearly $40 billion in annual sales. During that same 12-year period we shifted our
geographic sales mix from what was more than 60% U.S. based sales in 1998 to more than 60% international sales
today.

In 2001, the reshaping of our Pharmaceutical business began in earnest when we purchased Knoll Pharmaceuticals,
which included an R&D program that's now called by its well-known commercial name HUMIRA. As you know,
HUMIRA is on track to soon become the world's leading biologic for autoimmune diseases with annual sales this year
of approximately $8 billion. And today our total research-based pharmaceutical business generates nearly $18 billion in
annual sales. In 2006, we globalized our leading Nutritionals business to sharpen its focus and better capture
international growth opportunities and it worked. We've doubled the division's international sales over the last five
years.
Also, in 2006, we acquired Guidant Vascular and subsequently built our existing vascular business into a leading
interventional cardiology company headlined by the number one global drug-eluting stent brand XIENCE. In the last
four years, we've also rebuilt our core diagnostic business to deliver higher returns, doubling its operating margin and
significantly improving its cash flow.
So those are just some of the actions we've taken over the last decade. More recently we've moved to advance our
strategy with an eye toward two major initiatives: rapid expansion in fast growing emerging markets and a concerted
effort to re-energize and retool our research and development pipeline. To that end, we significantly accelerated our
emerging markets presence with the acquisitions of Solvay and Piramal Healthcare Solutions, the latter of which has
positioned Abbott as the largest pharmaceutical company in India, the second fastest growing pharmaceutical market in
the world.
We also created a new Established Pharmaceuticals division, a separate fully integrated $5 billion branded generics
pharmaceutical business that provides the infrastructure to expand in emerging markets. And we aggressively rebuilt
our late-stage research-based pharmaceutical pipeline through concentrated internal R&D efforts as well as strategic
in-licensing and late stage collaborations.
In the last four years alone, we've tripled the number of new molecular entities. And in the last two years, we've
doubled our late stage programs. Each of these major strategic changes plus other advancements that we've made along
the way has continually strengthened Abbott to better compete in our ever changing healthcare environment. The news
we announced today, to separate into two independent companies, is driven by this same disciplined, deliberate and
aggressive process.
As John mentioned, we'll be hosting an investor meeting in New York this Friday morning to further discuss today's
news including details on the two company's growth prospects and new product pipelines, which offer both companies
the opportunity for stronger and more sustainable growth.
So given our two hour analysts' meeting on Friday, we're going keep our comments brief today touching on only the
strategic rationale, the key benefits to shareholders and a summary of each respective company's unique investment
identity.
The strategic rationale and action behind today's announcement is the result, as I said, of a deliberate and exacting
process and part of the strategic evolution that's been underway for quite some time. We're now ready to separate into
two independent, publicly-traded companies because the investment identity and the operating model of each separate
enterprise is very different from the other. It's just that simple and straight forward. Our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals
business is more research intensive than the rest of Abbott and that's by design based on its business needs and strong
sources of cash flow and earnings power.
As you're all aware, pharmaceutical and biologic companies have to produce innovative medical treatments that
demonstrate clear patient benefits. These specialized proprietary medicines are more often used in the developed world
including the U.S. and Europe where best-in-class therapies generate significant demand. The majority of revenues for
this new pharma company will be generated from developed markets with 45% of revenues outside the United States.
So that's the snapshot of new proprietary pharmaceuticals company.
The Abbott diversified medical products company has countless sources of high growth opportunities that are well
balanced across literally hundreds of different product brands, different business franchises and different payers. The
pipeline includes dozens of game changing medical technologies, next generation diagnostic systems and devices,

newly formulated nutritional brands and an array of other incremental enhancements, such as consumer friendly
packaging, new product flavors and other meaningful brand initiatives.
The diversified medical products company will embody a vast portfolio of medical technologies and consumer
nutritionals that'll resonate in the developed world but even more importantly in the most rapidly growing emerging
markets where Abbott is well positioned.
We've taken actions over the last several years to pick up our pace of expansion into international markets that offer the
most promising growth prospects based on improving socioeconomic conditions. This is nowhere more evident than in
the key BRIC countries such as India. Abbott's the number one company in India because we moved quickly on unique
asset in Piramal Healthcare Solutions. It was a rare opportunity so we acted fast and we're pleased that we did.
So in summary, there's no question that both our research based pharmaceutical and diversified medical products
businesses have evolved over time in very different ways into two very distinct and compelling investment identities.
For example, the new pharmaceutical company is today generating nearly $18 billion in annual sales, it's delivered
market leading performance, including double digit top line growth in four of the last five years. That performance was
built on a sustainable mix of well-known prescription brands including HUMIRA.
Going forward, we've strengthened the pharmaceutical pipeline through more productive discovery and development,
strategic in-licensing agreements and select late-stage collaborations. This company will generate robust and
sustainable cash flow with the flexibility to accelerate pipeline programs as needed and the ability to leverage
break-through medications that can deliver meaningful benefits for patients. The end result should be strong and steady
shareholder returns including a competitive dividend policy.
I'm pleased to announce today that the research-based pharmaceutical company, which will be named at a later date,
will be led by Rick Gonzalez, a 30-year Abbott veteran who currently serves as Executive Vice President of our Global
Pharmaceutical business. Rick has served in numerous senior leadership positions throughout his Abbott career
including head of our Medical Products business and for several years as the company's President and Chief Operating
Officer.
Those investors who followed us over the years know that Rick is an experienced, well respected senior leader within
Abbott as well as within the health care industry. I have every confidence that Rick will go exceptional job as
Chairman and CEO of the new, proprietary pharmaceuticals company. I don't think it could be in better hands.
I will continue to serve in my current position as Abbott's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. So let me quickly
summarize what the new Abbott will look like and again we'll talk more about this on Friday. Abbott as a diversified
medical products company will generate revenues of approximately $22 billion in sales, supported by a multitude of
durable high growth franchises. Our portfolio will remain as well balanced as it is today with four major business
segments each roughly similar in size including Nutritionals, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics and Medical
Devices which encompasses our vascular devices, vision care and diabetes-care businesses.
Approximately 40% of our customer mix will be self-pay making it generally less dependent on the U.S. economy. In
fact, approximately 30% of total Abbott diversified medical product sales will be generated in the United States, with
70% of sales generated ex-U.S. Emerging market sales will be the largest geographic component and nearly 40% of
total Abbott diversified medical product sales. We'll continue to expand in emerging markets because that's where the
growth is and that growth is now three times the growth rate of the developed world.
We also plan to more effectively leverage the power of the Abbott corporate brand across each of these diversified
medical product segments. For example in our global Nutritionals and Branded Generics businesses we'll take
advantage of channel synergies to more efficiently reach our growing customer base.
So what can investors expect from the diversified medical products company in terms of growth? Well here's what I
expect. I expect the company to deliver at least high single digit sales growth and sustainable double digit ongoing
earnings per share growth, which should place it among the most attractive large cap healthcare investments. We'll
achieve this with balanced success across Nutritionals, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics and Medical Devices.

Nutritionals will be the largest business for now and one of the strongest global players in the industry with well-known
brands such Similac and Ensure. It generates high return on invested capital and very strong cash flow. We expect to
grow our worldwide nutritional sales at a double-digit pace with a cadence of new product launches and increased
penetration in key international markets such as China, India and Brazil.
We'll also significantly improve both the gross margin and operating margin profiles of this business. Our Established
Pharmaceuticals Division, or EPD, is among the leading branded generics businesses in the world, generating more
than $5 billion in sales from a portfolio that's composed of literally hundreds of different brands. EPD enjoys a
significant commercial footprint and boasts a registration pipeline of more than 1,000 individual products, which are
beginning to launch now in numerous geographic markets. As a result, we expect EPD to generate sustainable mid to
high single digit sales over the next several years with strong double-digit sales growth in the largest emerging markets.
We'll continue to optimize its cost structure as well, driving efficiencies where needed.
Our Global Diagnostics business includes the world's leading immunoassay and blood screening businesses as well as
our faster-growing point of care and molecular diagnostic segments, which today are modest in size, but will be
meaningful to earnings in just a few short years. We expect molecular diagnostics, for example, to exceed $1 billion in
sales by 2015.
Our concerted effort to dramatically improve bottom-line performance in Diagnostics has resulted in steady operating
margin expansion. That will continue as will better cash flow generation.
And finally, we have Medical Devices. We define this segment with our global vascular business, our diabetes care
business and our vision care business. As you know, our vascular business has a healthy and strong commercial
presence that's defined by the industry's best-in-class drug-eluting stent, XIENCE. In a matter of just a few short years,
XIENCE and XIENCE Prime have captured the number one share position in what is a competitive DES global
marketplace.
But this is not just a XIENCE story. We have industry-leading pipeline that contains upward of 20 new products with a
near-term launch of XIENCE Prime in the U.S. and a robust pipeline of DES, structural heart and endovascular
development programs. These range from our bioresorbable vascular scaffold, or BVS, which has the potential to
reshape the DES market to our MitraClip, next-generation, structural heart valve.
In diabetes care, we'll continue to focus on the insulin-dependent patient, a segment where we're growing faster than
any other competitor in the U.S. And in vision care, we expect to launch numerous new products and technology
advancements over the next several years with an eye toward operating-margin expansion.
In summary, the new diversified medical products company will maintain Abbott's heritage of financial strength with
abundant sources of revenues and cash flows and considerable flexibility to invest in strategic priorities and new
growth initiatives. The company will be a well-balanced blend sufficient of diverse healthcare businesses and new
geographies driven by a broad mix of payers and unique base of customers, many of whom are living in high-growth,
emerging markets where income levels are steadily on the rise, along with socio-economic conditions.
So with approximately $22 billion in sales, the diversified medical products should be without question one of the most
attractive and largest healthcare investment opportunities. It should also be among the fastest growing. Abbott's high
single-digit, top line growth coupled with continued margin expansion will deliver sustainable, double-digit ongoing
EPS.
As the environment has changed, so too has our company. We've reshaped, advanced and grown Abbott in a manner
that makes today's news possible. As a result of this separation, our shareholders will benefit from two new companies
that have evolved into two distinct investment opportunities and identities.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick to discuss the new research-based pharmaceutical company in more detail.

Richard A. Gonzalez
Thank you, Miles, and good morning. As Miles indicated our new research-based pharmaceutical company has a long
track record of demonstrating commercial and operating strengths. These attributes position us well for sustainable
performance going forward and help us succeed when we become an independent, publicly-traded company. Having
worked in leadership positions across Abbott for quite some time, including leading our pharmaceutical business for
the last two years, I can tell you this is truly a very strong business.
It's an organization with a long track record of industry-leading performance. This includes double-digit sales growth
four out of the last five years, a significant accomplishment in today's healthcare environment. The fact that we have
maintained such strong performance underscores the strength and experience of our pharmaceutical management team.
We have industry-leading specialty-focused portfolios that include a mix of growth brands such as HUMIRA, as well
as sustainable performers such as Synthroid and Lupron among others. Over the past several years we have built a
promising R&D pipeline of specialty medicines focused on important disease states such as, Hepatitis C, chronic
kidney disease, multiple sclerosis, oncology and other areas of significant medical need.
Since I'll be providing a more detailed overview of our pharmaceutical business and R&D pipeline on Friday, I'll keep
my message focused on two basic things today: first, the sustainable performance of our existing, commercial portfolio;
and second, a brief review of select highlights from our advanced, late-stage, pharmaceutical pipeline.
Our new research-based pharmaceutical company generates nearly $18 billion in annual sales today, driven by strong
marketing presence and leadership positions across more than 20 major pharmaceutical brands. These include:
HUMIRA, our market-leading biologic for immune diseases, which has an eight-year track record of commercial
success; Kaletra and Norvir, Abbott-discovered HIV protease inhibitors that changed the global landscape of HIV
treatment; Synthroid for thyroid disease, one of the most widely prescribed medicines that doctors choose to give their
patients in the U.S.; Lupron, a market leading therapy for prostate cancer, endometriosis and other conditions; Synagis,
a biologic for infants suffering from respiratory disease; CREON, a leading therapy for conditions associated with
Cystic Fibrosis; Androgel, the number one therapy for correcting low testosterone levels in men; and numerous other
medications.
So let's start with HUMIRA, which will remain a significant growth driver for our new independent company.
HUMIRA has a best-in-class profile, including a strong track record of demonstrated clinical, performance, utility
across a broad spectrum of indications and a well-established safety profile. And these strengths have played out in the
marketplace as evidenced by HUMIRA's strong ongoing performance. Despite the entry of several new competitors
over the last few years, HUMIRA continues to gain market share and demonstrate strong growth and there's plenty of
runway left.
As Miles said, this year we expect annual sales for HUMIRA to reach approximately $8 billion. This level of
performance is a testament to the outstanding commercial execution as well as the significant benefits HUMIRA
delivers for a wide array of patients suffering from serious medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's
disease, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and others. I expect our organization to sustain this positive momentum as it
drives to meet the demand in an expanding overall anti-TNF market where penetration rates remain low across all three
therapeutic areas: rheumatology, dermatology and GI.
We will also add to our broad list of approved uses for HUMIRA with the launch of several new indications, as well as
other product enhancements that we anticipate will further improve the overall patient experience. In addition to our
proactive long-term growth strategy we've planned for some possible changes in the anti-TNF market, including the
potential approval of an oral competitor as well as the possible entry of biosimilars in the later years of our long range
plan.
Orals and biosimilars may both someday have a place in the market but their potential entry will not materially change
HUMIRA's strong growth profile. HUMIRA will remain a growing, sustainable and leading commercial global brand
in the years to come. The global anti-TNF biologic market is significant and continues to grow nicely. In addition to

HUMIRA, several other market-leading brands on our current portfolio will complement our total-company sales
growth story. To that end we expect this portfolio, including HUMIRA's sustainable, robust growth outlook, to help us
achieve an expected total top line growth profile for the new company of flat to low single-digit sales growth in 2013
and '14, consistent with Wall Street consensus, and similar to our pharmaceutical peers.
Factored into this growth outlook are realistic expectations for a more mature lipids franchise, which we've said in the
past will see generic entrants beginning in mid-2012. Then beginning in 2015, we expect our sales growth to accelerate,
based on HUMIRA's continued strong underlying growth, as well as the launch of new products from our late stage
pipeline.
So finally, let me touch briefly on select highlights from our pipeline, which I'll cover in more detail on Friday. Like all
pharmaceutical and biotech companies, our business relies on a productive R&D engine capable of generating a steady
stream of products that serve unmet patient clinical needs. Over the past few years we've rapidly advanced our internal
programs such as Hep. C. And we've added 11 new assets through a concerted focus on strategic licensing, acquisitions
and partnering activity. As a result, we've tripled the number of new molecular entities with more than 30 in human
clinical trials today. We now have a total of 20 new compounds or indications in Phase II and Phase III development.
Our focus is on medicines that hold promise in difficult-to-treat diseases with significant market opportunities. Our
goal is to develop products that have strong clinical performance and deliver meaningful economic value in today's
healthcare environment. Bardoxolone, a compound we licensed from Reata Pharmaceuticals, is a great example of this.
This treatment, which is in Phase III development for chronic kidney disease, has the potential to dramatically change
the treatment landscape. Current therapies only modestly slow the profession of the disease while bardoxolone has the
potential to markedly improve patient outcomes. We expect commercialization for bardoxolone as early as 2014.
In neuroscience, we're addressing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, schizophrenia, pain and MS.
Daclizumab, our next generation Biologic for MS is in Phase III development. Our recently announced results from our
Phase II registrational trial suggests that daclizumab may offer patients the right balance of high efficacy and a
manageable safety profile. We expect to launch in 2015.
I'm also particularly enthused about our internal Hepatitis C development program. Our compounds have the potential
to dramatically change how patients are treated today by improving tolerability and cure rates and significantly
shortening therapy duration. We're projecting market entry in 2015 for a triple-combination HCV therapy. On Friday
for the first time we'll give you a preview of some select early stage data from our HCV program.
These three opportunities alone, bardoxolone, daclizumab and HCV, can together generate multi-billion dollar peak
year sales if successful. In addition, we have other promising medicines progressing through our pipeline and we'll
discuss some of these on Friday as well. In summary, we have a very compelling opportunity to create a new
independent, publicly traded pharmaceutical company with a distinct identity for our shareholders.
Today we're very fortunate to have a unique sustainable growth driver in HUMIRA one of the most successful
pharmaceutical products of all time as well as leadership positions in a host of our sustainable global commercial
brands. We also expect to see meaningful contributions from our pipeline in the coming years. In the meantime over
the next 12 months we will focus on running the Global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business within Abbott just as we
would normally. As you know, this business has strong margins and generates robust sustainable cash flow. As an
independent company this financial strength provides the opportunity for healthy returns to shareholders including an
industry competitive dividend.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for some transaction details.
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Rick. Let me review some of the key aspects of the transaction as we see them today. We expect to accomplish
the separation through a tax free distribution to shareholders. At the time of the separation Abbott's then current
shareholders will own 100% of both publicly traded companies. The final distribution ratio will be determined later in

the process. We expect the separation to be completed by the end of next year subject to regulatory approval and final
approval of the distribution of shares of the new company by our Board of Directors. Both companies are expected to
have strong balance sheets and cash flow to support strong investment grade credit ratings. Credit ratings for the two
companies will be determined by the rating agencies based upon financial projections and capital structures that will be
determined in the coming months.
We expect to tender for a portion of the current Abbott long-term debt outstanding in conjunction with this transaction
funded with debt issued by the new pharmaceutical company. It's expected that Abbott and the new pharmaceutical
company will pay a dividend that when combined would equal the Abbott dividend at the time of separation.
We expect to incur one-time separation costs including bond refinancing costs over the course of the separation
process. These costs will be quantified at a future date and will be treated as one-time items in our quarterly reporting.
As a result, there's no impact from this separation to our 2011 ongoing earnings per share guidance.
We'll complete audited financial statements that will result in a three year financial history for the new pharmaceutical
company. This information will be part of a Form 10 filing which is targeted to occur in the next few months. And
finally, we expect to complete this process in an efficient manner given the experience in integration and separation
that we've built over the years.
I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary of our third quarter earnings release. As you've now seen we
reported very strong third quarter results that beat the Street estimates and were at the high end of our forecast. We
delivered another quarter of double-digit sales and ongoing earnings growth with ongoing earnings per share of $1.18,
up 12.4% and we confirmed our full-year outlook for double digit ongoing EPS growth in 2011.
Sales growth in the quarter was 13.2% including a favorable 5.3% impact from exchange rates. Organic sales growth in
the quarter was nearly 7%. The majority of our major businesses delivered double digit reported sales growth. This
includes more than 15% growth for Durable Growth businesses driven by double-digit growth in Nutritionals, core
laboratory diagnostics, diabetes care and Established Pharmaceuticals. Our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business also
delivered strong growth with reported sales up more than 13%.
This reflects impressive worldwide performance for HUMIRA which increased nearly 26% on a reported basis and
more than 18% excluding exchange. HUMIRA's on track to exceed the sales guidance of high-teens growth that we
raised just last quarter. In our innovation driven device businesses sales increased 6% including continued double-digit
growth in molecular diagnostics and double-digit international growth in vascular and medical optics and emerging
markets continue to represent a significant growth contributor with sales in the quarter of $2.6 billion, an increase of
21% consistent with the high growth expectations we have for these markets.
Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 60.4% ahead of our previous
forecast driven by improved product mix. As reflected in higher SG&A expense we increased our litigation reserves for
previously disclosed litigation identified as a specified item in our earnings release.
Turning to our full-year outlook, today we're confirming our expectation for double digit ongoing earnings per share
growth for 2011 and narrowing our guidance range. Our guidance for the full year is $4.64 to $4.66 reflecting 11.5%
growth at the midpoint of the range. For the fourth quarter today we're issuing ongoing earnings per share guidance of
$1.43 to $1.45. The midpoint of this ongoing EPS range represents continued double-digit growth over the prior year.
We forecast specified items of $0.30 in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting integration costs from past acquisitions
and costs of previous restructuring actions. We're forecasting mid to high single digit sales growth in the fourth quarter
including a favorable effect from foreign exchange of approximately 1% and a gross margin ratio approaching 61%.
So in summary, while we delivered another strong performance in the quarter, more significantly we announced a
major strategic change for Abbott. The separation of Abbott into two publicly traded companies creates two enterprises
that are well positioned in their respective markets. Abbott is expected to be one of the fastest growing large cap
diversified medical products companies with a durable mix of products and the research-based pharmaceutical
company will be a leader in its industry with a strong and sustainable portfolio of specialty medicines and a promising
pipeline. We believe that both of these companies will be attractive opportunities for investors.

With that, I'll turn the call back to John and we will take your questions.
John B. Thomas
Thanks, Tom. Alane [ph], we're now ready to take questions, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you, and congratulations to you all, Miles, especially to you. This is a very bold decision
and clearly, in our view, the right decision for the company going forward and we hope other companies follow your
lead. So congratulations.
I just wanted to ask a couple of questions. Just apart from splitting up the two businesses and getting higher values for
those businesses, obviously the device business has been under pressure – not under pressure, but the multiple has
reflected concerns around the HUMIRA franchise and, therefore, you haven't gotten full value for some of your durable
growth businesses. But aside from splitting up the businesses and getting what you would imagine to be appropriate
valuations for the two very distinct businesses with different risk and growth profiles going forward, can you talk about
some of the other advantages to breaking up such as how we should think about capital deployment? How we should
think about operating margins of these businesses? I mean one thing that we have noticed is that Abbott has a very
large overhead or redundancy that I would think would be able to go away if you complete this transaction. So if you
could just talk about some of the other efficiencies that you can create by splitting up the two companies.
And then I have a question for Rick on the Pharma business. I mean clearly HUMIRA is the big driver of the overall
business and will be an even bigger driver in terms of its contribution to the proprietary pharmaceutical business. With
competition coming in the next year or two from tofacitinib, with competition from biosimilars, clearly, this will be an
issue and I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit about strategies you have in place to protect that franchise. Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. Jami. That may be the longest question I've ever experienced in my 13 years.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Oh, come on. It wasn't that long
<A - Miles D. White>: The fundamental – let me just give by way of background the fundamental basis for the
separation here. I heard a comment this morning that from another analyst source that causes me to want to make sure I
make the point.
We've always pursued a diverse model and we believe in that model and we believe in the diversity of the business and
the growth opportunities it gives us and frankly the reliability and sustainability over time. But what's happened here is
we've been so successful in our proprietary Pharma business over time it's grown quite large. And, frankly, arguably I
believe it will be very successful going forward. I think when the companies are split. I believe both will be valued at
the top of their peer groups but for very different reasons.
In a portfolio of diverse companies, the characteristics of those businesses need to be similar. And as our proprietary
Pharma business has grown large it has different characteristics and it's also quite dominant now in the portfolio. And I
think that it's given the company, clearly, an identity of pharma with oh, by the way, you have these other diverse
businesses but as you can see by how we propose to split, the company has $22 billion in a very diverse mix of similar
characteristic businesses as I described. And a very successful proprietary pharma business that is delivering great
returns and cash flows and has great potential and durability going forward but it's a business that investors seeking
return will look to.

Investors who are looking for a large cap diverse double-digit grower aren't necessarily looking for the same type of
investment identity as pharma. So what happens here is the pharma piece got so big and is different that these two
investments make sense separately and both are of a critical mass and size that they have great sustainability going
forward as independent companies, etcetera.
As we divide them, their characteristics, their P&Ls, their balance sheets, etcetera are quite different. The capital
structure I'll have Tom deal with in just a minute, but both have strong cash flows. Both have strong pipelines of
products, arguably they're different. One is dependent on big products. One is dependent on hundreds or thousands of
products over time. The diverse company will be dependent on a lot of market growth and international expansion. The
pharmaceutical company is still quite heavily a developed market company and it will, too, have emerging market
opportunities but it's very much a developed market game.
So they've become very different. And I think that both will be valued more accurately or frankly appreciated more by
investors. And I think we'll see that we attract investors who haven't been in our company or haven't invested in our
stock as we allow them the choice of these two, distinct identities.
I think there's opportunity for operating margin expansion and gross margin expansion, particularly in the diverse
company. I think visibility to margins in the pharma company, what will compare quite favorably to its peer group. I
think you'll see that.
With regard to the overhead question you asked, I would say we're always looking at the opportunity to be more
efficient and given the distinctive separation of the companies that is something that we will look at because there's a
different mix for the pharma business and a different mix for the international-based diverse products business, and we
will be looking for those opportunities to be a lot more efficient. That's about all I'd say about that at the time.
But at this point I think [audio gap] (39:55)
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: ...the points I'd make. And I think we made these points in the remarks. I mean both of
these companies are going to have extremely strong cash flow. Both of them are going to have very good balance
sheets. It's going to give both companies a lot of options to use that cash flow. I mean we've talked about our
expectation on the dividend, and there'll continue be a dividend in line with what Abbott's paying today is our current
view.
One thing I'd point out on cash flow is between the two businesses – and if you look at our amortization expense, which
as you know is a fairly large item in our P&L, in the $1.4 billion range, more of the amortization relates to the
diversified company than to the new pharmaceutical company, which means that cash flows are even a little more
balanced than the profit levels when you look between the two businesses. So both are healthy, they're going have a lot
of options and both managements will – it's kind of a nice problem to have as they move forward as they consider what
to do with those cash flows.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Jami, you still there?
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Yeah, I am. I was just wondering if Rick was going to address my question? Or we could wait
until Friday. But that is going to be the key push back in my opinion, which is the pharma business is now completely
dominated by HUMIRA. And how, Rick, we should be thinking about that equation going forward with competition
coming from tofacitinib and biosimilars in 2016?
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: I think it's a very good question, Jami. I'd characterize it this way. So start at the very top.
If you look at where our pipeline starts to emerge in 2015 and beyond in a very meaningful way, it will add to the
performance of the business above and beyond HUMIRA.
If you look at the performance of HUMIRA, we believe that performance is very sustainable going forward. In fact, if
you look back to 2007, HUMIRA's grown on average $1.1 billion every year and we believe that is sustainable and
actually slightly accelerating as we move from 2011 and 2012. Now what drives that is the ability to continue to
penetrate the markets that we're in today, like RA, like psoriasis, like Crohn's. Those markets are still tremendously
under-penetrated.

I'll give you an example. Psoriasis has a penetration rate of about 6%. Our most mature market, RA, has a penetration
rate in the 20% range. And so the goal here, and you've seen us introduce programs around the world that allow us to
be able to drive the market to grow faster through early diagnosis of patients and then cycling them through
less-effective, old therapies more rapidly. And you've seen that market growth particularly outside the U.S. emerge
very, very rapidly where the market's growing mid-teens in many countries around the world, even in Europe.
And so there's still a lot of opportunity to drive growth for HUMIRA in the markets we're in today. Additionally we
have six indications that we are in the process of developing and submitting for HUMIRA. Those six indications will
have a material impact on the growth of the product going forward. And there are likely to be indications that
competition doesn't have at least out of the blocks. So I would tell you that I feel very confident that HUMIRA has a lot
of legs going forward and can continue to be a sustainable growth vehicle for us for a long, long time.
Now let me address the competition. I'll start with orals first. As we look at this market, just I'd say from a global
standpoint, this is a very difficult market for competitors to break into. And you know the data as well as I do. So six
competitors have entered the biologic market over the last five years, not one of them has gotten over 3% market share.
Collectively in total, all five of them have not gotten over 11% market share.
So the three major players, us, Enbrel and REMICADE control between 80% and 90% of this market. So it's a difficult
market to break into because safety is a critical component. And those three products have the longest safety database
of any products on the market and have very good efficacy. I mean, these drugs work well. They get the efficacy in
patients that physicians want to see and patients want to have. And so this isn't a market that competitors break into
easily, particularly if they don't have long-term safety data and very good safety data.
Now, we don't know what the oral products' label is going to look like. We've looked very carefully. I've looked
carefully at the data that has come out their trials thus far. And I'd say I'd characterize it right now based on what I
know as roughly equivalent efficacy to HUMIRA or other TNFs; safety profile that's similar to TNFs from an infection
rate, maybe slightly higher. It's hard to tell based on the data at this point. And then other safety questions that will have
to be addressed from a labeling standpoint, like increases in creatinine, increases in anemia that cause patients to drop
out, and increases in LDL.
I'd say based on what we believe the profile of a product has to be to get rapid uptake in the market, we're relatively
comfortable with being able to defend our position against oral products.
Biosimilars I think are a different issue. First of all, as you know, our molecular patent doesn't expire until early 2017
in the U.S. and 2018 in Europe. So we feel the product's very well protected at that point. We have numerous IP patents
from a process standpoint that go beyond that. We'll have to see which of those is applicable to any competitor that
comes forward.
From a regulatory standpoint, clearly in the U.S., the regulatory path is still undefined. I think what we do know is that
the FDA will hold a biosimilar product to a standard similar to the innovative product from a standpoint of efficacy and
safety. So that will require, in all likelihood, significant clinical trial work, which will be expensive and time
consuming but I think the biggest issue will be that in all likelihood these products will not be interchangeable. In fact,
I think it's highly unlikely that they'll be interchangeable, like oral-solid generics are.
And so it creates a very different competitive dynamic when they have to go out and apply SG&A and that SG&A has
to be effective in the marketplace. And they're going to have to sell on their own data, not use the innovators' data. And
so it will be a very significant issue to come head to head against the established players and be able to take share away.
Now that's not to say we take either competitor lightly. I can tell you that we do a lot of planning to try to understand
how we're going be able to deal with that and I think our strategies around that make me feel comfortable that
HUMIRA will be a very sustainable brand. And as I said, I also look at our pipeline and I look at a number of the assets
in that pipeline that will emerge in 2015 and beyond and I feel pretty comfortable that will be a very meaningful impact
going forward.

<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you, our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Good morning and I offer my congratulations as well. Let me do a couple financial
questions first and then talk more strategy, and Tom, hopefully you can help here, but maybe two quick ones.
Tom, first off, when I think about the tax structures of these two businesses, the proprietary-pharma piece would seem
to have a lot lower tax structure versus the durable medical products business. Am I thinking about that correctly? And
is there any damage to the tax structure from the split? I'm assuming no but if you can give me your thoughts on that,
that would be helpful.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, Mike, we're not going to go into a lot of modeling issues today. As we talked about
in the beginning, we're trying to focus today more on the strategic discussion here. What I would say is I think it's
accurate that between the two companies the diversified would be a little bit higher than the other company but that's
about as much as we'll share with you today.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay. And then on the proprietary piece, can you give us an estimate of the percentage
of the profits in the proprietary piece that would come from HUMIRA post-spin?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, well as you know we – if you're looking just to get a sense of profitability on these
businesses we do disclose in our segment footnotes these businesses broken out so that gives you a good sense overall.
And clearly HUMIRA is an important product for us. You can have a sense of the relative sales and it's definitely an
important part of that business but as Rick said, it's one we think has a very long-term future, lots of growth
opportunity, continuing to grow, new indications and plenty of opportunity to be a long term contributor to the
business.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay. Last financial piece. You talked, Miles, about growth in some of the DMP pieces,
or medical products pieces. You talked about Nutritionals growing double-digits. You talked about some of other
pieces including vascular. You all seemed to suggest that those businesses would be accelerate like Nutritionals
globally hasn't grown double digits, it's grown more like high single digits and so there's some expectation that growth
would accelerate. Can you just maybe touch on why should we assume that those businesses accelerate and how DMP
goes from being what right now looks to be more mid-single digits to high-single digits?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, we'll go into it more on it Friday, Mike but actually let me correct you. Nutrition
has grown double digits outside the United States and frankly I do expect even more acceleration from the businesses,
particularly as we extend the footprint in emerging markets and internationally. So I do expect not only acceleration of
the sales but also acceleration of the bottom line. And those programs are underway. But this is the – the performance
and elements are there now. And we are seeing that. At any given point in time, one country or another is going look
different than the mix of the whole. But yeah, we can talk about that more on Friday.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay. Just so I'm clear, you're taking the whole Nutritionals business, not just the
international piece right?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: You mean on this side of the business?
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Yeah, right.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yes.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay. That's what I was talking about, the overall growth profile for Nutritionals.

<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, you'd be right about overall but the international piece has doubled in size in the
last five years and we can back into that growth rate, that's clearly double digit.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Right, absolutely. Let me just talk more strategy stuff. So I guess what people are asking
me, probably number one today is, is the decision on why today versus a year ago or a year from now, so the timing
question? And then, two, in your – in the math that you did on this, in trying to – you're going to go through a very
trough tough process here in splitting the company up, how much value in your estimation are you unlocking by the
math that you guys did in doing this to make it worthwhile?
<A - Miles D. White>: I'm going to enjoy answering that one. Let me address the why now. There's actually method in
the madness as to why now. As you know we acquired Solvay and Piramal and we went through an integration process
and then frankly a separation process internally of our Proprietary Pharma business and our Established Pharmaceutical
business which are very, very different businesses. So we had kind of a double task there of not only the integration of
the legacy Abbott businesses but also those two new ones. And not to mention our additional agreement with [ph]
Zydis (51:21) in India, which enhanced our product lines but there was a process there to establish that infrastructure
and stabilize all of that and separate the two Pharma businesses.
That is essentially complete. And that was necessary work to do regardless. But we needed that to be complete and we
also wanted some of our pipeline initiatives on the Proprietary Pharmaceutical side to have been completed and frankly
our internal organic pipeline to have advanced in order to be at a point of what we would consider to be readiness.
Those are the primary drivers of why now. I don't think we'd have be ready a year ago. And I think we are ready now.
We've got the positioning and a lot of the work done so that the difficulty of separation frankly has – a lot of it's been
done. And so it's ready to go. So there's no real point in waiting now as we get on with it.
With regard to unlocking, as you might guess, I've looked at more investment banker and consultant and other
presentations and estimations and so forth of the so-called unlocking of value. I would not venture an estimate or a
guess because I've been here long enough to have seen a PE of a company in the high 20s and a PE in the low-teens or
whatever. You can talk about unlocking value, but at the end of the day the background of what's happening in a
marketplace with the values of companies as a whole, or the economy as a whole, can clearly affect that up or down.
Do I think investors will realize or see or recognize higher value on both sides of the company, as separate companies?
I do. I think investors will appreciate both companies more than is the case today because I think there will be a lot
greater appreciation and attraction to investors who focus on these two very different investment profiles. The same
investor doesn't invest in both profiles necessarily and vice versa.
So I think we'll see appreciation for both companies, but what happens in the overall marketplace over time I don't
know. So I wouldn't venture a guess. I leave that to you guys.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Thank you, Miles. Again, congrats.
<A - Miles D. White>: Thanks, Mike.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Thanks, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thanks very much. My congratulations as well and Miles really just two questions. One, any
consideration instead of a tax free spin for an outright sell of the pharma business and maybe even to some degree even
rights to HUMIRA as one would think about this perceived unlocking of value or either less reliance on a single
product?
And then the second question's a little more related to strategy. If you go back to your Q4 comments when asked either
about sentiment around HUMIRA or either selling the – or spinning out the Nutritionals business, you commented or at

least the sentiment I took away was the sentiment in the market is wrong. We need to do a better job of really talking
about each particular business in the long term opportunities. And you seemed to harp on this notion of if you make a
knee-jerk decision on what the market wants you to do in the very, very near term you may be wrong a year, two years
or three or five years later. And I'd like for you to comment on that because it seems to be slightly different in tone than
what we see today. Thanks, very much.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. Let me deal with the first part, did we consider selling? I think the obvious here is, first
of all, that would take a long time and secondly the tax on a sale like that and whether there was somebody that was
interested in such a thing is prohibitive.
Now I have to tell you I think we've got two long term sustainable companies here. We have no interest in selling. We
have no intention to sell. We're not looking to sell it or merge it with something else etcetera. We think we've got the
best path for investors here which is two independent companies going forward that both have great cash flow, profits,
growth prospects etcetera, depending on the company here but they're two different investments.
I think that for investors and for the sustainability of these investments is the right path for both companies. Otherwise,
I don't think we're doing the right thing if we just try to sell it. That doesn't strike me as the right path here at all. Which
is why we believe the path of separation and letting investors appreciate each company appropriately is the right path.
With regard to the last call or whatever that you're referencing, the call at the time or the question at the time was a
focus on Nutritionals. The point I tried to make at the time and let me be clear, this was in our planning and preparation
for some time. This is not some knee-jerk reaction to the last few months or years even. We have been considering
what is the appropriate long term disposition of the company or companies for several years.
Obviously I can't speculate about that to analysts or investors on any given call. But, as you know, analysts speculate to
me. So when they speculate to me publicly about, for example, in this case nutrition, one thing I feel obligated to do
sometimes is disabuse us of the notion of some path that may not be correct. And that isn't correct and it wasn't correct
at the time. I do think what I reflected or intended to reflect at the time was kind of the precursor to this notion of
investors will appreciate the parts of the company differently. There is a different investment identity to different parts
of the company. And I think that the notion that the different parts of the company weren't being appreciated that way
or different investors weren't seeing it that way was clearly in those comments and that's probably the tone you heard.
But the answer to that, which I think you see today, I think is the right answer. I don't think it's to just break things up
into little pieces. I do believe there is value in the diversified model that is Abbott. We believe that fundamentally and I
think that's been proven out over decades, but I also note that the characteristics of the elements of that diverse model
do have to have a common or complementary characteristics and balance. And the big distinction here is the – was our
Proprietary Pharma business that did so well and dominated the identity of the company over time and not only were
we out of balance, but the identity of that business was very different as it evolved. So what we ended up with is two
very distinct successful pieces and the notion that nutrition was – the proper piece of that was the part that I didn't agree
with because it's very consistent with a lot of the characteristics of the rest of the company, the growth prospects,
etcetera. At the time it was being compared to a PE of a competitor.
Now, I think all of us in this industry would love to have the PE of that competitor. Who knows how sustainable any of
these PEs are over time, but I think that the mix, as we've described it today, is correct given our strategy as a diverse
company in healthcare with a particular balance.
So I don't think this is at all inconsistent, Tony, with what the tone I communicated at the time. I think it's, frankly, very
consistent, but at the time I couldn't say to you, hey, good idea but you got the wrong business that you carve out here.
And that's kind of the essence of this is the notion at the time – the question I got was more a notion of are you sure all
of this mix fits together? That's how I would take it and the hypothesis was gee the nutrition was the one you could
carve out. I think the notion had merit. I think the Proprietary Pharma business is the one that has the distinctly
different identity and I think this makes sense today.

<A - Miles D. White>: Thank you, Tony.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Hi, David.
<A - Miles D. White>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Miles, just a quick question. It's been addressed here a little bit, but I want to ask it maybe in a
different way. We believe Abbott is undervalued and the primary issue certainly does seem, in the eyes of most
investors, to be confusion over HUMIRA. So as you think about your current multiple, it does imply real concern
around HUMIRA, its cash flow growth and profitability, but you all in management are much more bullish on the
potential for HUMIRA than consensus. So I wonder why not wait to see for that to be appreciated in the market as
competitive threats prove less material than most people think, which is only really two to three years away?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I think two things. First of all, I think that this split is not about confidence around
HUMIRA. It's around the identities of the businesses, as I described earlier. I agree with you that the company is
underappreciated and perhaps undervalued, but I don't know any CEOs out there who wouldn't claim that their
companies are undervalued. I think the entire sector may well be undervalued. The entire stock market could be
undervalued it depends on your perspective for the business, it depends on your perspective of the development of
international markets, it depends on your perspective of a lot of things. I'd support your notion that we're undervalued,
but I think the notion of a split here is – it has the right merit, logic, given our intent regarding the investment identities
of the company and what belongs in a diverse mix.
The – at the end of the day, the questions around HUMIRA's durability will clearly be answered. I think we will go a
long way toward answering that even more thoroughly on Friday. Rick answered a lot of it earlier in the phone call, but
I think we can respond to the durability of HUMIRA going forward. As Rick acknowledged earlier, the growth of
HUMIRA continues to be very strong and continues to be in excess of about $1 billion a year. That's the equivalent of a
so called blockbuster a year here in growth.
Now, granted, that's not going to happen forever, but there's obviously several years left of that kind of durability and
growth and strength in that business and that franchise. And, I believe, that with further explanation on Friday we will
further lay out why we see the development of the market, the biosimilars, the orals, etcetera, as we do and investors
will make their choices. But I think we have evaluated that pretty closely and pretty carefully over the last couple of
years. We have a view, we have a view of the durability of HUMIRA. We'll share that with investors and I think the
obvious next question an investor has is what about after HUMIRA? What then? And I think that greater visibility to
the pipeline of the Proprietary Pharmaceutical business will go a long way toward filling in those gaps for analysts and
investors. And I think we're beginning to fill those gaps now.
But even if there were great visibility to that on the part of investors and analysts and even if there were great
understanding of all of that, by the same, we would still be splitting the company because we believe there are two
really distinct different and valuable investment identities here that makes sense as two separate public companies.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: That's very clear. Thank you, Miles. And maybe just one more strategic question. You, like a
lot of healthcare CEOs, have talked about the healthcare environment and what that make look like over the next 3 to 5
years, I guess the question is, isn't size an asset in this environment? And I wonder will this limit your flexibility at all?
For example, if your device franchise stand-alone needed more breadth to compete and more bundling would occur in
that segment of the marketplace, couldn't HUMIRA cash flow have enabled future acquisitions there? So simply is size
an asset and does this limit your flexibility at all?

<A - Miles D. White>: No, I don't think it limits our flexibility at all. You've got to remember, we're a very large
company becoming two very large companies. These are both large-cap companies at the end of the day. They're both
very strong companies and they both have very strong cash flow. The cash flow of each of these companies is
equivalent to what the entire company was not that long ago. The cash flows are very strong on both sides. I don't feel
like either one of these two companies is going to be constrained or limited by what it may wish to do.
We're not actively seeking large acquisitions. I think at least on the side of the medical – the Diverse Medical Products
company, I'd tell you I think that there is so much potential for growth and sustained double-digit margin growth that
we can do that organically. For us, any acquisitions or additions to the company I think will be very much opportunistic
and because there's an opportunity we believe we can uniquely leverage in the mix of our business over time. Will there
be those opportunities? I think there will be over time. And we'll react to them and evaluate them as they come and
we'll be able to do it opportunistically and we'll have no shortage of capital or flexibility to do it.
On the Proprietary Pharma side, I think the same is true. I think that there are pipeline opportunities for Rick to add to
that business, there is no shortage of capital flexibility to do so. Both will have very strong cash flows. We are not
reliant as a company on HUMIRA alone. As I indicated earlier, all of these businesses are generating positive cash flow
today.
And actually if you went back 10 years ago that wasn't true. You know, the Diagnostics business didn't generate cash.
Diabetes business didn't generate cash at the time. Today they do. All of these businesses generate strong cash flow, so
no shortage of flexibility.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Great. Well, congrats on an historic move. Thank you.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Thanks, David.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Good morning, Miles, and hey, Rick, good to hear your voice. I'd start with – sort of pick up
where you left off David's question. Is it too soon, Miles, to talk in a little more detail about your preliminary vision for
the ongoing Abbott? You said – you made comments will continue to expand in emerging markets. I'd expect to hear
that you're already a strong presence. But you talked about channel synergies and you highlighted the self-paid mix.
Maybe help us think – where does Miles White see the company going over the next five years? Is it more of a
consumer-oriented company? Is there other capital – opportunities in capital or IT? Just any preliminary thoughts
would be fabulous.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, Rick, as we've talked about on previous calls, the emerging markets in particular are a
big growth opportunity because of the expansion in those economies and the expansion of the healthcare systems in
those economies. And the structures of those markets are very different, not different just with each other but different
than say the U.S., Europe, Japan historically. They are much more self-pay markets than reimbursed markets, in
general, and our Established Pharmaceuticals or Branded-Generics business and our Nutritional businesses are,
generally speaking, in those markets self-pay businesses and yet growing very rapidly in those markets. They share
common outlets. They share common distribution channels and so forth and while we have not at this point attempted
any kind of synergy between them, they do share common visibility, brand, outlet, pharmacy, wholesaler, etcetera in all
those markets. And I think that footprint will definitely benefit us going forward.
I think it's a plus to have a mix of sources of how your products are paid for. You know for a company in our business,
if you're solely dependent on the U.S. and Europe, well then you're going to be dependent on governments and payers
that are highly concentrated. And that's going be true of the characteristics of our proprietary Pharma business and
that's been the case for a lot of our mix of business over time. One of the things that was attractive to me about the
ophthalmology business was that a big chunk of that business is consumer-discretion business, the LASIK business.

And while that business has been pressured by the economy in the last few years, I like the fact we're not just
dependent on government reimbursement in a lot of cases for payment for our products because I think for those
countries, those businesses, those products where consumers make the decision, your business is somewhat less
vulnerable to large structural moves in the payment system.
So I think that mix is good. I think that we will continue to expand in emerging markets because as I said earlier,
growth is there. We are not ignoring developed markets. There's a big chunk of the company, both companies frankly,
in developed markets. And those are important markets to us but I will tell you that I think the developed markets will
be much slower growers for the future and a lot of the growth will come internationally and especially in emerging
markets.
So I think that the obvious distinction that way between the Pharmaceutical business and the Diverse Medical Products
business is the Diverse Medical Products business has the market growth, the expansion, the expansion of those
economies, a tailwind of growth that's not going be that dependent on single, large products.
The Pharmaceutical business will always be dependent on single, large products because that's the nature of that
business. And the productivity of our R&D and therefore the importance of our pipeline and the durability of products
like HUMIRA are very important for that business. And I think that's why our Pharmaceutical business has been so
successful over the last decade. And I think we'll continue to be going forward. But those are different, in different
market dynamics.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Just a follow-up, you highlighted the potential for improving gross margins and operating
margins. Maybe you want to talk a little bit about that. Is that factory consolidation? Is it just re-aligning how products
are made and where and distributed? Is that significant in your mind? And then maybe just Tom, when will we see you
start reporting some kind of breakdown for the two companies differently? Will it wait until the Form 10 comes out?
Or? Thank you.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Rick, I'll just say we're going to explain more about this on Friday. The first...
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Okay.
<A - John B. Thomas>: The first question on margins.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, Rick, in our segment information you already have quite a bit of basis for
understanding the major businesses here. So I mean obviously we do need to go through this carve-out financial
process, which is going to take several months. And that's when you'll see a little more specifically more of a
fully-allocated picture of the Pharma business than what you see in the segment footnotes. But you have pretty good
information right now. And I'd say as we get later into the process, after we do the Form 10 and get closer to the true
separation, we'll be getting more granular in how these two businesses look.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Thanks so much.
<A - Miles D. White>: And Rick, and to answer the granular point you put up front on the gross margin. There are
businesses here that are changing the structure of manufacturing and other things in their sourcing and even how they
go to market in some cases. Diagnostics has had a great program that way and has expanded its gross margin. Diabetes
Care same. Nutritionals, major programs underway right now to change the mix of its gross margin. Some of it is our
manufacturing strategy globally. Some of it's whether we make it ourselves versus source it, etcetera. There are a
number of factors that contribute to it. But we will talk about it a little more on Friday.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Appreciate that.

<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Hey, good morning, guys and congratulations. And thank you for taking my call. I have two
questions. One, the Established Pharmaceuticals business, I wonder if you can walk through the reasoning why that
wasn't put with the Pharmaceutical business? I would have expected that this could have been a nice buffer against any
pipeline failures and government intervention that you mentioned. So maybe comment on that?
And then the second question is, I wonder we're all asking about timing but also we're now in this unusual period now
where there's healthcare reform implementation. We've got a super-committee discussing further Medicare cuts. I
wonder if this also played into the time now to do the split? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. First comment on the Established Pharmaceutical business and the Proprietary business,
I'll tell you that other than the fact they both have the word pharmaceutical in their headline they're really different.
Their business models are different. The markets where – that are attractive to them are different. The Proprietary
Pharmaceutical business is very much a developed economy business for all the reasons we know. The kinds of
products that we sell and the costs of those products and so forth, their affordability and so on, those are developed
market products.
The Established Products Division at least here you'll note doesn't have a U.S. business and won't. It is not our
anticipation to be in the U.S. because it wouldn't make money here. And at the end of the day we are trying to earn a
return on the investors' capital. So that business will stay focused on international markets. And then the nature of the
competition and the selling frankly, Glenn, has a lot more in common with businesses like our Nutrition business than
it does the Proprietary Pharma business.
It's a business about a breadth of product line and key leaders in key categories, your feet on the street and relationships
with many, many, many pharmacies and wholesalers and so forth in these emerging markets. The business model and
how money is made are very, very different. And there isn't actually a lot in common there. So it made sense to us that
the Established Pharmaceutical business belonged with the other very durable growth businesses and not with the
Proprietary Pharma business.
With regard to healthcare reform, I would say healthcare reform is a contributor to the environment in general. It
clearly has impacted the environment for healthcare products. It has impacted the environment for pharmaceuticals and
for medical device products. Frankly, so has the debt crisis and pay crisis in Europe. The impacts on the economies in
the U.S. and Europe, aging populations, all the things that we know are happening to pressure the healthcare products
markets in the U.S. and Europe all contribute to a different environment. And at the end of the day I'd say all that does
is change the nature of the environment in which we compete and operate.
That's going to clearly have an impact on all the businesses, not just Pharma. This is not motivated solely by healthcare
reform at all. But healthcare reform you could say is a contributor to the overall environment that has contributed to a
bigger consideration about the investment identities of these two businesses.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: And just one follow-up.
<A - John B. Thomas>: We have time for, I believe, about two more questions if we have people in the queue.
Operator

<Q - Catherine Jayne Arnold>: I wanted to probe a little bit on the Pharmaceutical business if I could. I know I for
one have been looking for more and more disclosure on your pipeline and I guess we'll get that on Friday. But I know
you have a high level of optimism about the outlook for that business and I am anxious to hear the details but clearly
some of the assets like hepatitis and MS are very much changing quickly in terms of standard of care and have a lot of
intense competition. So let's just say there is some risk in terms of the pipeline of that particular Proprietary
Pharmaceutical business. How are you thinking about that in regards to business development? And if you could
comment about the cash flow outlook. I think that you're sort of implying HUMIRA will probably grow another billion
dollars per year for I'll say a couple years. I don't know if a couple means two or three to me. But at the same time
you're losing the lipids franchise. So there is – where are we in the adequacy of the cash flow for business
development? Because I'm sure you want to make sure that there's some cushion, some buffer in the outlook for the
pipeline given the competitive dynamics in some of the key franchises in the late stage and given obviously longer-term
acknowledgment of some risks on HUMIRA. That's a mouthful. I appreciate it.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: It was a long question.
<Q - Catherine Jayne Arnold>: I'm out of breath now.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: I'd say a big part of that we're going to answer on Friday. I will tell you we understand
the competitive dynamics pretty well in hepatitis as well as MS and I think we can walk through that on Friday. I'd also
tell you just don't focus on hepatitis and MS. Bardoxolone is a big asset. We have a number of other assets that we'll
talk to you about but clearly the areas we're going into are areas of high unmet clinical needs. They're competitive.
Okay? I think we understand the profile that we need.
HUMIRA, I think you described it. You've described it in a way that's consistent with what we think, although I would
say I have a view that's different than you about sustainability and that is the key to this. Right? We believe there is
strong underlying growth that will be maintained for a longer period of time. We believe there is plenty of opportunity
to penetrate these markets and on top of that the pipeline will play out. There certainly will be a period where the
generic impact on our dyslipidemia franchise will depress overall growth rates but the underlying growth rate will be
very, very strong and so when that plays through, you'll see it pop back up with very healthy growth.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Okay. I think we have, [ph] Alane, time for one last question, especially since we're going to
be talking to folks on Friday.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question is from Barbara Ryan from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Barbara A. Ryan>: Oh, good morning. Congratulations, and thanks a lot.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Hi. Thank you.
<Q - Barbara A. Ryan>: Thanks for taking my question. Most of them have been asked but I'm just wondering, I
think you answered why you separated emerging – established products from the proprietary business because the risk
profile and the cash-flow characteristics and persistency make it fit more with the medical products business. But I'm
just wondering when you acquired those business you did talk about the opportunity to cross-sell the two companies'
products. I'm just wondering if there's any dis-synergies associated with separating those two? I know you talked about
that they have been separated largely internally and if there's a plan to commercializing some of your Proprietary
products in those emerging markets that are dominated by these established products. And then I have another question.
<A - Miles D. White>: It's interesting. We – I don't expect dis-synergies and the companies will in some cases still
maintain common brands in some examples. Where the EPD business will have a brand overseas in some markets and
the Proprietary business will have it in the U.S. or some others.
<Q - Barbara A. Ryan>: Okay.

Page 20 of 21
<A - Miles D. White>: That's not uncommon. As you know, products like Enbrel or REMICADE and others have had
two companies marketing them in different markets over time. So I think that some things some might assume would
be dis-synergies or conflicts won't be and it won't be for us. So I don't see that there's an issue there. The notion of cross
selling and share – the companies, frankly where it makes sense, can cooperate. We're not going be in any kind of
direct competition anyway. We aren't now. So I think that – I don't think there's any threat to the original comment.
Although clearly, Barbara, neither necessarily relies on that for its success. I mean both can be completely
independently successful without reliance on the other even if there are some shared assets. Rick, you want to add
anything to that?
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: No, I think that covers it. I mean clearly emerging markets aren't as significant for the
Proprietary business as they are for the other business. But they are a significant contributor to our growth. In certain
emerging markets where you have reimbursement access, that's the key for the Proprietary product.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, I think that's an important point. The Proprietary business will also have opportunities in
the emerging markets and we'll definitely go after those opportunities. They have presence there now. They have
people there now. And there is market there now, albeit smaller in terms of numbers of people or whatever. But sizable
in terms of dollars for some of the places that Rick mentioned.
<A - John B. Thomas>: So, Barbara, you had one more question?
<Q - Barbara A. Ryan>: Yeah, thank you so much. So the question really is about the outlook. You made some very
specific comments about the growth outlook both for top and bottom line in the Medical Products business. You spoke
to sort of competitive low single-digit top-line growth for Proprietary business, but you didn't comment on earnings.
And I'm just wondering given the fact that the company has been diversified and along with that your investor base is
looking for persistency and consistency and double-digit earnings growth, whether there is likely to be any change in
the investment profile of the Proprietary business, i.e., do you see opportunities to spend more in that business that you
were reluctant to do? And maybe believe you should be doing because they were married to a business with different
kinds of expectations?
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: I think if you look at the investment identity of pharmaceuticals within Abbott, I would
say that the way we plan and the way we run businesses within Abbott, it's – although we're all part of a big family, the
reality is we build our own P&Ls, our own plans by year and we try to invest in a way that's appropriate for the right
return for the investor. And so I can tell you without question that the pharmaceutical business was never under-funded
on programs that they believed that they could advance more rapidly.
Now it depends a lot on the evolution of your pipeline. As you get more and more of your pipeline in Phase III, it's far
more expense to be able to develop those products, but whether we were inside of Abbott or outside of Abbott that
would be the same investment profile that we would drive the business in order to maximize the return on that
investment going forward.
<A - Miles D. White>: Barbara, I think you'll see eventually here in the split of the companies and their P&Ls and
balance sheets and so forth, a profile in the Proprietary Pharma business is pretty healthy. A profit profile and a
spending profile that's pretty healthy. Its R&D spending compares well. Its SG&A spending compares well particularly
given the focus of its business in Specialty categories.
I agree with what Rick said. It's not in any way been under-funded or had to subsidize anything else. When you look at
the whole of Abbott Laboratories and look at the profiles of R&D spending or profits and so forth, there's a dilution
that occurs there in the mix of all of that makes it difficult to see the individual profiles of businesses.
The R&D intensity of Nutritionals business by comparison is low-single digits. It's not necessary to spend more nor
does it take more. When you marry the size of the sales of a business with a lower profile, where your spending is
much higher in SG&A than it is in R&D and so forth and you look at combined total, I think you could question that.
But as you see the Proprietary business broken out, I think what you'll see a very healthy profile that in no way
constrains it. And I think you'll see proper profiles that are competitive in the other businesses as well on the other side.

John B. Thomas
Thank you, Barbara. That concludes our conference call today. As I mentioned earlier, we did post a 12-page slide deck
to our Abbott investor website that summarizes today's announcement about the separation into two publicly-traded,
independent companies. I also mentioned if you joined us late in the call that we are hosting an investor meeting this
Friday, October 21, in New York from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., where we'll discuss the growth opportunities in each of
these businesses in more detail and answer some of the questions that came up today as well.
Miles, Rick, Tom and Dr. John Leonard, who I mentioned is our head of R&D for Pharma will be in attendance, along
with Larry and me and some other folks. Additionally if you listen to a replay or if you'd like to listen to a replay of our
conference call today after 11:00 Central Time, it will be available on our Investor Relations website at
abbottinvestor.com and after 11:00 a.m. Central Time via telephone at 203-369-3519, confirmation code 2128756. The
audio replay will be available until 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday, November 2.
So thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing hopefully many of you in New York on Friday
or in the coming weeks and months as we talk to you individually about this transaction and the growth opportunities
going forward. Have a good day.
