MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today's call
is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer
sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.
At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of
Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.
Troy J. Lahr
Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's third quarter 2014 earnings call. I'm Troy Lahr, and with me today
are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer.
After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please
limit yourself to one question.

As always, we have provided detailed financial information in today's press release, and you can follow this broadcast
and slide presentation through our website at Boeing.com.
Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals included in our discussion this morning are likely
to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement
disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for
disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some comments on the quarter and our business
environment. After that, Greg will walk you through details of our financial results and outlook.
Now let's move to slide two, please. Boeing delivered another strong quarter, with solid operating performance across
our production programs and services businesses, which drove a 19% increase in our core earnings per share. This
performance has allowed us to continue returning cash to our shareholders through our strong dividend and share
repurchase program.
Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 15% to $16 billion, and operating margins were strong at 11.2%.
We delivered 186 commercial airplanes in the third quarter, including thirty-one 787 Dreamliners, and we added net
new orders of 501 airplanes.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security revenue was $8 billion in the third quarter, and operating margins increased to
10.8%. BDS captured numerous key contract awards in the quarter, including: NASA's Commercial Crew spaceship
program, with a potential value of $4.2 billion; and the first order for the 502 Phoenix small satellite. Significant BDS
program milestones include: delivery of the first Chinook helicopter under the latest multiyear contract with the U.S.
Army; the successful launch and orbit of the seventh GPS-IIF satellite, and delivery of the first four upgraded Airborne
Warning and Control System [AWACS] aircraft for France.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide three. Strong growth in the commercial airplane market
continues to drive demand that supports our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade. Net
new orders for the year of 1,011 are well above our planned output. And our record backlog of more than 5,500 aircraft
represents more than seven years of production at current rates.
Given the 737's robust backlog of more than 4,000 orders, we plan to increase production from the current rate of 42
per month to 47 in 2017, and then increase production again to 52 per month in 2018. Furthermore, the compelling
value proposition of the 787 and its sizable backlog of more than 850 orders are driving production rate increases from
today's 10 per month to the previously announced rate of 12 per month in 2016 and then up to 14 by the end of the
decade. We also are increasing production on the 767 from the current rate of one per month to two per month in 2016.
Notwithstanding a somewhat richer mix of global, economic, and geopolitical developments throughout this year,
which we are monitoring very carefully, global passenger traffic trends are strong and air cargo traffic continues to
gradually improve, although the latter still remains a watch item for us. We continue to see replacement demand as an
increasingly important market driver, with airlines opting to introduce newer more efficient airplanes with compelling
economics and a rapid return on investment rather than keeping older less efficient models in service.
Our new technologically advanced airplanes not only have far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, but
also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, greater range, and a better overall
passenger experience. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.
When we look at that combination of growth and replacement needs over the next 20 years, we forecast global demand
for nearly 37,000 new commercial airplanes.

Nearer term, customers continue to demonstrate confidence in their fleet plans, with deferral requests still running well
below the historical average, and we continue to have requests to accelerate deliveries. This ongoing strong demand
coupled with our large and diverse backlog underpins our outlook for sustained growth in the years ahead.
In the twin-aisle segment, we continue to see healthy demand for both the 777 and the new 777X, which are outselling
the competition by a wide margin, giving us confidence in our ability to transition between the two airplanes. We also
continue to enhance the value proposition of the 777 for customers with our relentless drive on product improvements
that will further increase operating efficiencies.
Year to date, we have 45 orders and commitments for the 777. We expect demand for the 777 to remain healthy
through the end of this decade, with an anticipated average order capture of around 40 to 60 airplanes per year to
support the transition to the 777X. We'll continue to evaluate our options for the most efficient way to transition from
the current 777 to the 777X as the new airplane enters final assembly in the 2018 timeframe. We are also introducing
new manufacturing processes and technologies that allow us to further optimize the 777X production system. As we've
mentioned before, a smooth production transition is a top priority on this program.
On the 787 program, we achieved several noteworthy milestones, including delivering the fifth 787-9 as well as the
first 787-9 with GE-powered engines. Both the GE and Rolls Royce engine types are now certified on the 787-9. In
addition, our Charleston facility delivered its first 787 at its planned production rate of approximately three per month,
which supports the overall current production rate of 10 per month. Production performance in Charleston continues to
progress nicely.
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains high, with cumulative orders totaling
nearly 2,300 airplanes from 47 customers. The production bridge from today's 737 to the 737 MAX remains solid, with
the first 737 MAX delivery expected in 2017.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid support for our major programs in the FY 2015 budget
process. We are encouraged by the actions taken in both the House and Senate Appropriations committees with regard
to additional Apaches and EA-18G Growlers as well as strong support from both P-8 and tanker. Our international
business represented 28% of BDS revenues during the quarter and 37% of the BDS backlog, as we continue to leverage
our unique One Boeing global advantage.
Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives,
space, unmanned systems, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, and the critical few large-scale future programs
that are priorities for our customers, like long-range strike, space launch system, UCLASS, and the T-X trainer.
The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven, and
affordable. We continue to focus on driving further efficiency, quality, and productivity gains to improve program
profitability and fund investment in future growth. As part of these efforts, BDS continues to make strong progress on
our market-based affordability initiative as we strive to reduce operating costs by another $2 billion to ensure
competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending.
Our announcement in December of plans to consolidate some of our Defense service and support work into Oklahoma
City and St. Louis is one example of those efforts. Decisions that affect our workforce are never easy, but we are
fortunate to have a growing commercial business with employment needs that have helped mitigate some of the impact
on our people.
In summary, our team is executing on our business strategy by meaningfully growing revenues, generating solid
operating performance on improved execution, and capturing strategic new business.
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance, Greg?
Gregory D. Smith
Thanks, Jim, and good morning.

Let's turn to slide four to discuss our third-quarter results. Third-quarter revenue increased 7% to $23.8 billion, driven
by growth in our Commercial Airplane business. Core operating margins increased to 10.2%, reflecting solid
productivity gains in both businesses. Third-quarter core earnings per share increased 19% to $2.14 on higher volume
and continued strong operating performance.
Let's turn now to our Commercial Airplane business on slide five. For the third quarter, our Commercial Airplane
business increased revenue 15% to a record $16.1 billion on 186 airplane deliveries. The solid BCA operating margin
of 11.2% reflects strong program execution, offset by the impact of higher 787 and 747 deliveries and higher fleet
support for new customer introductions. Commercial Airplanes captured $69 billion of net orders during the quarter,
and backlog achieved a new record of $430 billion on over 5,500 aircraft and seven years of production. In the third
quarter, 787 deferred production costs increased $947 million to $25.2 billion, largely driven by the increase of 787-9
production and the continued inventory pull-ahead to efficiently optimize production and minimize disruption as we
introduce the aircraft into our production system.
Similarly, on the 787-10, we'll continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our build plan in early 2015 to mitigate
early introduction risk while preparing to increase the overall 787 production rate to 12 per month in 2016. The team
continues to reduce unit cost and improve flow time on both the 787-8 and 787-9 through continued focus on
optimization of the production system and maximizing efficiencies.
Overall, we continue to make solid progress on the 787 program. However, we still have work ahead of us, as I said,
introducing the 787-9 into production, preparing for the 12 per month rate, and again introducing 787-10 while driving
efficiencies across all aspects of the program. The team remains focused on solid day-to-day execution, risk mitigation,
and improving the long-term productivity and profitability and cash flow going forward.
Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on slide six, third-quarter revenue for our Defense business was $7.9
billion, and operating margins increased to 10.8% due to strong performance across the business. Boeing Military
Aircraft third-quarter revenue increased 3% to $3.5 billion, reflecting higher volume on our P-8 program. BMA
operating margin also increased to 12.4% on continued solid program execution.
Global Services & Support revenue at $2.3 billion and operating margins were 9.7%, largely due to delivery mix in the
quarter.
Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $2 billion, reflecting timing of ULA [United Launch Alliance] launches
and lower government satellite volume. Operating margins increased to 9.3% in the quarter on strong program
execution across the portfolio.
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $60 billion, with 37% of our current backlog now from
international customers.
Turning now to slide seven, Boeing Capital's net financing portfolio increased slightly to $3.5 billion on some new
aircraft volume.
Now turning to cash flow on slide eight, third-quarter operating cash flow before pension contributions was $1.7
billion, driven by higher Commercial Airplane production rates and solid operating performance, somewhat offset by
timing receipts and expenditures in the quarter. During the quarter we made a planned discretionary pension
contribution of $750 million.
With regard to capital deployment, we paid $525 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 8 million shares
for $1 billion in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchase activity to 39 million shares for $5 billion. The
capital deployment to date continues to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and our backlog and our commitment
and confidence in the business performance going forward. We expect to complete the remaining $5.8 billion
repurchase authorization over approximately next one to two years. Returning cash to shareholders along with
continued investment to support future growth remains a priority for us.

Let's move now to cash and debt balances on slide nine. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable
securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.
Turning now to slide 10 and we'll discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2014; we're increasing our core earnings per
share guidance for 2014 by $0.20 to now be $8.10 to $8.30 on continued solid execution. Based on strong operating
performance combined with the impact of timing of receipts and expenditures, we're increasing our operating cash flow
guidance before pension contributions for 2014 to now be greater than $7 billion.
In addition, as a result of our continued focus on execution and disciplined cash management, we're lowering our
outlook for capital spending by $200 million to now be approximately $2.3 billion for the year. This performance
allowed us to further return cash to shareholders as we continue to aggressively repurchase shares and pay dividends.
We remain confident in our long-term cash generation potential given the focus on execution, our ability to deliver on
the unprecedented backlog, and our unmatched portfolio of products and services.
We're also increasing our BCA operating margin guidance to be approximately 10.5% on improved operating
performance. In the fourth quarter, we expect BCA margins to be impacted by higher deliveries of 747 and 767, some
additional planned fleet support costs for new customer introductions, higher R&D on the 787-10 and 777X, as well as
additional investments in productivity initiatives.
In summary, third quarter financial performance reflects the strength of our backlog, the strong demand for our
products and services, and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the enterprise.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jim for some closing comments.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Greg.
With three solid quarters behind us, we are focused on closing out the year with continued strong business performance
that will allow us to meet our customer commitments, fund our investments in the future, recognize and reward our
team for their work, and continue to return cash to shareholders.
Our priorities in 2014 and beyond remain clear: profitable ramp-up in production on our Commercial Airplane
programs, executing on our Commercial and Defense development programs, driving productivity and affordability
throughout the enterprise, continuing to strengthen and position our Defense business with targeted investments and
further international expansion, and all the while providing increasing value to both our customers and our
shareholders.
Now Greg and I would be happy to take your questions.

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: But on the other side, deferred production on the 787 moved slightly above your guidance
level, and I would say free cash flow for the quarter was low given your guidance even before pensions. So I'd like to
understand better how you see the operating performance, the strong operating performance we've seen turn into cash
going forward. And specifically, when do you see the 787-8 and the 787-9 each turning cash positive? And what else
drove the high unit margins in the quarter, and is that something that we should expect to continue?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Okay, Doug, let me start with cash flow. Certainly, you're right, strong execution across the
business and across the programs, and that's certainly driving our cash flow to date. And as I mentioned before, there's
timing quarter between quarter when it relates to advances and milestone payments. So some of that is what you're
seeing, so I'd equate that to timing is what you're seeing in the quarter.
And as I mentioned, we've been pulling forward 787 inventory and particularly around 787-9 to ensure that that
program enters into the production system in a very smooth manner, of which it's doing. We've also got some timing
around C-17 orders that we've talked about. So those again all related to timing throughout the balance of the year. So
we still expect to see very strong cash flow through the balance of the year, and really coming from the elements we've
talked about, continuing to execute on the deliveries, on the productivity, as well as the 787 unit cost.
Now when you look forward into 2015, we expect to see continued growth in cash flow, again through the execution on
the production rate, additional productivity, international orders. And then that will be somewhat offset by higher cash
taxes and 777X R&D starting to come into play, but the fact is you'll see growth. And then from there forward, as
we've talked about, you'll continue to see operating cash flow growth throughout the balance. And again, that's all
executing on our production rates and continuing to drive productivity. I'm not sure if I covered all your questions.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: If you look at the – you're talking about moving inventory forward related to the 787-9. I'm
trying to understand. If it's possible to put that aside for a moment and think about how the 787-8 and 787-9 are each
performing in terms of cost, are those – is the 787-8 cash-positive yet if you were to look at it on a standalone basis?
Can you give us a sense of where that is today relative to what I would call more one-time items related to inventory
timing?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: As I said before, we're not cash positive yet. We expect to be cash positive in the 2015
timeframe, and that will be a blend obviously of 787-8 and 787-9. But if you step back and look at unit cost on 787-8
and 787-9, they continue to progress well, as I've talked about on prior calls, as well as I'd say the other key indicators
that ultimately make it into deferred and cash around float time and overall cost equality, all of those trending in the
right direction on the program. So obviously, we expect that to continue. We continue to expect to come down the
learning curve on the 787 as well as step down in supplier pricing and we're continuing to work the productivity
initiative, all of that ultimately contributing to cash flow over the long term of the program.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Okay.

Our next question is from Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Greg, just staying on the deferred, I was wondering, if you could, if you have a new estimate
of where it might peak, or if we're sticking with the about $25 billion even though we're already a little bit over.

And then just honing into the 787-9, I think the pull-forward that you've talked about on the inventory is a little more
than maybe you expected a year ago. Could you maybe give a little more concrete – give us a little more on exactly
what's going on there? Is this payment to suppliers that are happening in advance? I guess quantify it a little bit and
help us get a sense as to when it maybe flips the other way.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Maybe just to help, when you look at just over $900 million of growth in deferred in the
quarter, there's about a couple hundred million dollars in there that's related to 787-9 pull-forward. So essentially, what
they're doing is as these products become more mature in the production system and the suppliers of performing, we're
pulling both components in and migrating those into the production system to allow a smooth transition as we're
operating it at 10 a month. And Ray [Conner] and the team have done a fantastic job in doing that, and you're seeing
that in the results when we're making obviously our deliveries. And so that kind of methodology they're utilizing in the
production system is a risk reduction. It certainly impacts deferred on the near term. But as far as the long-term
profitability and risk reduction on the program, it's absolutely the right thing to do.
And as I said to you in the past, the program team out there is focused on unit-by-unit improvement on all aspects,
whether it's quality, unit cost or flow time, and ultimately cash, and that's certainly what they're managing. But there
are some near term, as I said, risk mitigating activities that we've taken into account here that do impact near term on
deferred, but are absolutely the right thing to do for this program. And that's what you've seen in the quarter, and you're
going to continue to see some of that as we start to pull forward 787-10 products and get those into the production
system, derisk the overall production system, and get ready for 12 a month.
On the overall deferred, there's really no change. I said it would be approximately $25 billion. We're at $25.2 billion.
But again, keep in mind; the last two or three quarters we've pulled forward 787-9, and that wasn't in the original plan.
There's no question about that; but again, absolutely the right thing do. So we're continuing to focus on it. But like I
said, Joe, it's all about making rate and making unit cost improvements unit over unit, and that's what the team
continues to focus on.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: If I may, I know this is violating the one-part one-question, but just to keep on the point.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I understand the 787-9 pull-forward. It was a couple hundred million dollars, and I think
maybe it was $300 million or so and $300 million or $400 million last quarter.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Right.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I understand that. But it doesn't seem like sequentially the other part of deferred really came
down. It seems like that was maybe $700 million and change last quarter, $700 million and change this quarter. So is
there any more color on the 787-8?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: 787-8 continues to make progress. So we're continuing to make progress there, as we have.
So I'd say they're continuing on the trajectory of reducing unit costs as we've been on.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Okay.
Operator
Our next question's from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thanks so much. Not to beat a dead horse, but if we take out the pull-forwards, which is
not execution, it doesn't look like the 787 deferreds are coming down that much. Hence it's pretty – I'm confused as to
why you got a $1 billion positive swing in unit cost to about $500 million profit. Which were the programs that were
profitable or more profitable in the third quarter versus in the second, and how does that all square with the trend in 787

deferreds?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: On overall unit, we saw improvement on the 777 quarter over quarter and about flat on the
737. Now to give you some perspective on the 737, we also had a block extension of 200 units that included the
investment to go up to 52 per month. But also most of those 200 units were 737 MAX airplanes. So I think it really
gives you a sense of the value this airplane is bringing to the marketplace and, at the same time, the focus on
productivity that you're seeing, not just on that program, obviously, on the other programs. So good performance I'd say
on the core programs, and continuing to make progress on the 787.
But when you look at unit versus program, Cai, you've also got to take into account, as I talked before, mix; so you've
got more early build on the Charleston and more 787-9s in there in Q3. And even with that, you've seen improvement
when you compare unit to program. So continuing to make progress, still got a long way to go, but I think they got
good plans in place. They're monitoring them. We've got the enterprise engaged on how to capture more productivity,
and then going forward, obviously, Partnering for Success and supplier step-down as we introduce new blocks into the

And next we go to Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning, gentlemen.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a quick clarification on the 777 to your comment about unit versus program. Did the 777
program margin change in the quarter? And then as a follow-on, the period expenses in fleet support that you called out
both in the release and in your prepared remarks, Greg, can you help us understand maybe how impactful that is to the
full-year margin? And then maybe help us understand the cadence of those expenses. Quarter over quarter, have those
been growing sequentially each quarter, or were they high one quarter versus the others? Any help there would be
much appreciated.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Sure, 777 margin did improve slightly in the quarter. And again, a lot of the things I talked
about on the 787 are obviously embedded into the 777, so we're continuing to try to reduce the unit cost overall on that
program, so you're seeing some of the results of that.
On the period expense, I'd say the moving pieces within there are fleet support. And as you know, we're introducing
more new 787s to customers this year than we have in the prior years. And we want to ensure that that is a very smooth
transition, so we're making investments in fleet support to ensure that they are able to introduce those airplanes very
smoothly into their operating system. And then R&D, so you're starting to see – in the back half here you'll see 787-10
really starting to ramp up. And you'll also see early introduction of the 777X R&D. So those are primarily the moving
pieces.
You also got a little bit of mix in the fourth quarter on BCA margin, where we'll have a couple more 747s that'll be
dilutive on the margin basis. But again, we're going to continue to manage that as we have. And if we see an
opportunity to improve that margin in the fourth quarter, we'll certainly capture those gains.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: All right; thanks.

Our next question is from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Great, thank you for taking my question.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Greg, I wanted to ask a bit about the buyback activity year to date and what the right way to
interpret it is. In the prepared remarks, I heard you reaffirm that you'll finish the rest of the authorization over the next
one to two years.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: I'm curious. When we think about the buyback year to date and the fact that it's been at an
elevated rate, is that a disagreement with the market on the price of the stock? Is that the expectation of continued
strong execution going forward? What is driving the decision to buy back at an elevated rate?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I'll save you the latter.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Okay.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Absolutely. When you step back, just think about – and I've talked about this a lot because
there's a lot of big moving pieces in here, as I've talked before, on advances or milestones. You step back and you think
about last year and this year combined, over $16 billion of cash generation coming from the core operation. And you
look at that and then you look at the production rates, you look at the record backlog, and the fact is I think we've got
maybe three or four production rate increases going forward that we need to execute. We've already been through
almost 17 to date, and that's what's given us the confidence.
The risk profile, obviously, has changed dramatically and the continued focus on execution. And repurchasing $5
billion of stock this year really, again, looking forward, looking at the strength of the backlog, looking at our ability to
execute on that backlog and capture additional productivity, and that's what's really driven us to buy back the shares at
the pace we have been buying back. And we put the authorization in place obviously to utilize it, and we're going to
continue to do that as we see fit. But it gets back to just the fundamentals and I think the competitive differentiator in
the marketplace, in the financial marketplace, where you're looking at 5,500 airplanes in backlog, and we know where
they are. We're very happy with the quality of that backlog, and it gets to execute on that, and executing on that
flawlessly. I think the team has done a great job and we're going to continue to do a great job going forward.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: And is there potential to revisit or even increase the authorization going forward?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, we certainly will do that as we see fit.

<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: I wanted to follow up on the question about some of those period expenses, which is that
if you look at the BCA guidance, that would imply something like a mid-8% margin in the fourth quarter. And I would
think a lot of those things like R&D, the mix to 787, et cetera, really don't change going into next year. So is that how
we should be thinking about BCA into next year as well?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I think as you think about next year, obviously we'll see strong growth coming out of
BCA going into next year, again, executing on the production rates. And we're also expecting a little bit higher services
revenue going into next year.
Now on the margin front, we're going to have a little bit more R&D than we had this year. And again, that's the ramp
down obviously of the 787-9, ramp-up of the 777X and the 787-10, and then again improvements on 787 margin
expected into next year. And then we're going to continue to make investments in 777X automation, as we've talked
about I think in the past. So those are the moving pieces as you think about going into next year. And then of course,
we're continuing to focus on the productivity initiatives I discussed. But that's generally, I think, the best way to look at
it for next year. And again, on the top line, we know what we need to do. And on the bottom line, we're going to
continue doing what we have been doing this year and last year on productivity.

Our next question is from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Greg, just on something you said a couple questions ago about the importance of
execution and also volumes, rate increases, and we're all sitting here waiting for free cash flow per share to get into the
double digits and into the mid-teens perhaps. What's the timeframe? When do you have the confluence of this rising
execution and at the same time the volumes that will drive that long-awaited steeper slope in the cash flow? Is this 2017
when you hit the next rate on the narrow body, because the 787 component of it seems to be moving a little bit to the
right here, when you said earlier sometime in the 2015 timeframe 787-8 goes breakeven.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: So when should we be thinking about a change in the slope on the free cash flow curve?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, as I said, we're going to see growth next year and expect to see growth thereafter, and
it's really again executing on the production rates.
Now, once you get to peak rate, I would say that's where you really have maximized the cash flow of just the basis of
the elements of what's driving the cash flow between progress payments and delivery payments. So once we get to peak
rate is really where you should see the real potential or peak potential from the company; and then again, the Partnering
for Success and the other initiatives more mature out in that timeframe.
But again, the top line is pretty solid. When you look, we know the rate breaks. We know what we need to do to
execute them, far fewer than what we've had to. And we're making investments today; we're making investments in that
growth, whether it's 787-10 or whether that's MAX or 787 – or sorry, 777X. So obviously, those investments will peak
as they get I'll say T-minus entry into service, and so there will be some offset there. But again, we continue to see a
strong cash flow profile going forward driven on those elements of the business.

<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Right. But, Greg, how do we factor in the fact that your peak rates keep moving the right,
and not because they're delayed, they just keep getting higher?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I wouldn't say the rates have moved to the right. They've moved up.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: That's what I mean, getting higher. So you have new peaks further out at higher levels...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Right.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: ...and continued investment to get there. So it's a little – when you talk about maturing at
a peak rate, are we talking about the 10 per month on the 787, the 12 per month, the 14 per month, the 42 per month,
the 47 per month, or the 52 per month on the narrow body? How do we think about it? What's a peak rate? What's a
mature rate?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I think all of those are going to come into play. And as you know, they're all pretty much
staggered throughout that next five-year period. But when you talk about investments, as an example, we've already
made the investments or accounted for the investments of going to 52 a month on the 737. So again, I think this is a
demonstration of strength of the market and the strength of the portfolio. And again, I wouldn't call it moving
investments or moving rate to the right. It's more moving rates up.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: I wasn't trying to suggest they're delayed.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Okay.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: I meant going higher, just a quick one for Jim. Jim, we've seen a lot of movement in the
price of oil here. And I know that airlines fleet-plan on a long-term basis. But at what price of Brent crude might we see
some demand destruction?
<A - W. James McNerney>: First of all, airlines tend to buy on the distribution around a mean. And in a volatile
world, that distribution is pretty wide. So their behavior tends to be driven by that more than a point estimate. Having
said that, our analysis shows the price of oil could still fall a long way before our planes are anything other than
compelling economically. This generation of new planes that we're introducing are anywhere from 16% to 24% more
efficient than the planes they're replacing. This replacement generation has more compelling numbers associated with it
than any generation I've seen since the 707. So our analysis, we do sensitivities on both interest rates and price of oil.
And you've got to go a long way from where we are now before you begin to see even incremental impact.

<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Greg, just a clarification question for you and then one for Jim as well. On the clarification,
can you just talk about or clarify the cadence of cash and deferred on the 787? Is it the case that the 787-8/787-9, move
into a profitable state as the 787-10 is ramping up, and therefore things stabilize? Is that the right way to think about
things on the 787?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, I think it's a combination – certainly getting to 12 a month, getting the 787-9 rate up are
really the stabilizing factors obviously, and continue to come down the learning curve internally, and then the

step-down pricing on the supply chain are really the big drivers in there.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: But then offsetting that will be some deferred build on the 787-10? Is that right?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Correct, yes. And like I said, if there are opportunities to pull some of this forward and I'll
say verify it in the production system, we're certainly going to do that as we have with the 787-9. And as you've seen,
it's been very successful. But that's a quarter-by-quarter, month-by-month decision that we'll make as we get closer to
those products moving into the production system.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Great.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: But 12 a month is a big milestone on deferred production.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Right. And, Jim, the question for you is just, the phrase productivity gains and Partnering for
Success that's been used throughout this call, can you give us an update on where we are with Partnering for Success
and what you at this point, knowing what you know about the success of that program to date and the productivity
gains that you're seeing, what kind of margin expansion opportunity do we have here for the Commercial business in
particular?
<A - W. James McNerney>: You're seeing the beginnings of the impact now in the margins you're seeing in our
businesses, so pretty robust margins. We have plans to keep them in that neighborhood at least. And I would say we're
still in the first 25% of this initiative. We've probably matured deals with somewhat over a third of our supply base.
There are discussions with another third and then there's another third that we're jousting with a little bit.
So seeing the beginning of the impact now, still a lot more in front of us than behind us, and I think it is going to be
fundamental not only to our profitability but also the profitability of the people we work with. We're taking cost out of
our mutual business activities. And those that are working with us are getting in many cases more volume from us as
part of the arrangement. And this all gives us more flexibility on either taking it in margin or using it in price in the
marketplace when we face those situations. And if we hadn't had this program, we wouldn't be able to respond
properly. And so we're going to keep pushing this one.

<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.

<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Hey. Maybe, Greg, the advances, they were a use of cash in the quarter.

<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: And I'm coupling that with I think the best commercial BCA bookings quarter in
your history, and certainly I would imagine relative – in your prepared remarks you said that orders were coming in
well ahead of your expectations for the full year. So can you play out why advances aren't more of a source to your
original benchmark for cash flow and/or what's offsetting it?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Absolutely. As you know, on an initial order there isn't a lot of cash that comes with that
initial order. Most of the cash associated, that's with progress payments. So that's where you're seeing an offset. It's
purely just timing of progress payments one quarter to another. So there's nothing else to read into that other than

timing on progress payments.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: So in other words, there's no help that you're getting from the outsized order activity
for your full-year guidance on cash flow?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No, I wouldn't say that. And you'll see more strength in the fourth quarter, so that's where
you'll definitely see some timing in there. And then as we've talked about, you've got a little bit of inventory when you
look at it on net basis, inventory buildup on 737 and 787 that are also offsetting that. But again, I'd just equate that to
purely timing.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: So one clarification, the C-17, is that a cash headwind to this year on white tails, or
is it all virtually into 2015 that we have to think about?

Our next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hi, good morning, Jim and Greg.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hi, Peter.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Jim, you've mentioned the last couple years that the majority of deliveries have been going for
replacement versus growth. I'm wondering if we can just put a finer point on that. About how long do you think this
window continues to exist where we're seeing the majority of deliveries go for replacement before we trend back to the
historical growth estimates that have been associated with deliveries?
<A - W. James McNerney>: If you look back in history, history is 75% growth, 20% to 25% replacement. Starting
with really the 787, the replacement has been double that; so a real discontinuitous change, so about half replacement,
half growth.
I think you're going to see it continue for a while as the new technology we've developed rolls through our model
families. For example, you're seeing it on the 787 today as it replaces the older medium-size wide bodies. You're
beginning to see it on the 777 as we spiral a number of those technologies now into the 777. You're beginning to see it
on the 737 MAX. And so I think that's going to continue probably for another decade or so with a more robust mix of
replacement versus growth, which is the good thing about us in the sense that it will keep us disconnected from overall
GDP trends. This is what gives us a multiplier on GDP, and I think it's – and it all stems from innovation. It all stems
from the inventiveness of our people and staying out in front of the marketplace and our competition in that regard.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: If I can follow up to that, one of the things that's been driving this has been the elevated fuel
prices. So I know you mentioned to Rob's question about...
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: ...it would have to go a lot lower. But some analysis indicates that if you saw oil at $70 for an
extended period, you'd see some disruption. Are we thinking a number materially below that?

And that will be from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Noah.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Maybe since I'm last I'll do one more deferred question.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Great.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: I guess I'm wondering now that you're at $25 billion, is it possible to more precisely pin down
what the word approximate means in the approximately $25 billion? I know that's maybe splitting hairs, but I think a
lot of your stakeholders really care if it is going to really hover around $25 billion while it's flat before coming down,
or if it needs to be $26 billion or $27 billion before it comes back down. And in that answer, if you could also address
since the inventory pull-forward that you're doing, which makes sense, was unanticipated and not in the original plan,
are there any other potential new strategies that could come about that you could tell us about that we could be in front
of?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Certainly the 787-10. If we have an opportunity to do that for all the reasons I talked about
on the 787-9, we'll absolutely do it. And that's supporting profitable growth going forward, and it's a risk reduction.
And it is absolutely the right thing to do, and again, I think the 787-9 performance demonstrates that. And so that's
probably the one that comes to mind where if we have opportunities we will. It could impact near-term deferred, but I'll
tell you. Long-term productivity and profitability for the program will benefit as a result of that and ultimately cash
flow.
On the deferred, a year ago I said approximately $25 billion. There have obviously been a lot of moving pieces within
that number. And the 787-9 performance on a unit cost basis, and I think I tried to give you some color on the progress
that's being made there. They are making good progress. Do we expect to make more, absolutely. Would we like it to
happen faster? Absolutely, the team is very focused on it. And then making rate, and the team has done a good job on
making rate, and then the supplier step-down.
So all of those elements within deferred are being managed all around profitability and cash flow. Quarter to quarter,
they're going to change. There's no question about that, depending on what's taking place in the production or where we
can pull forward certain elements, even of 787-8 inventory. If we can pull some of that in, we'd pull that in at the same
time. So it's going to move around, Noah. But as we enter into more 787-9s and we have the opportunity again to risk
mitigate, we'll do that as well. But we're managing it obviously with a very focused mindset on cash generation and
long-term profitability and cash generation for the program over the long term. Again, there are some near-term
decisions that you're going to see, but they're absolutely the right thing to do to drive, again, solid growth on both top
line and bottom line for the program.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay. But I guess given we're a little over $25 billion, we're not breakeven yet on 787-8, we're
a little more on 787-9, we've yet to pull forward on 787-10, each of those being a couple hundred million dollars, it

sounds like the approximate could translate to $1 billion to $2 billion rather than $100 million to $200 million. Is that a
fair assessment or is that too large?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I think it's certainly – we're going to continue to do this quarter over quarter. I certainly don't
see a profile that gets you to $2 billion, but it will depend on the decisions we make on pull-forward. And if we decide
to do that – and our continued focus on unit costs, so obviously it's about making rate and coming down on the unit
cost, and we're going to continue to focus on that. But like I said, this is all about making investments now to ensure
that we have long-term profitable growth on the program.
Next year on a cash flow basis on the program, it certainly will be much better than what it was this year. And again,
it's all those things that we've talked about. And during 2015, we expect to be cash positive on the program. So we're
going to continue to execute on that and I'll say continue the productivity enhancements that the team has developed on
the program that again really benefit not as much today, but definitely next year or next month or next quarter and the
following years to stabilize the production system and maximize the efficiency.

2015 timeframe. Given the transfer, the planned transfer of some commercial work there and Wichita as well, I wonder
if that decision-making timeframe is still valid, or in fact bringing the commercial work in fact may change your mind
regardless of what happens on the military side.
<A - W. James McNerney>: The key factors around any significant decision around St. Louis eventually gets to F-15
and F-18 production. We're pleased to see in the current budget proposal that F-18s are supported in the FY 2015
budget, which takes us out through the end of 2017. The international orders on F-15 take us beyond that. Now that's
not yet etched in stone with our government. So could there be a significant decision first part of 2015? Yes. Does it
look as if we may be able to navigate through that? Yes, but I wouldn't want to say categorically that a decision
wouldn't have to be made at that time. Obviously, longer term, Long-Range Strike is a program that we think we are
well positioned to win, which would certainly sustain St. Louis over the longer term, whatever perturbation we'd have
to face into shorter term.

Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Hi, a quick question on 747-8. I'm just wondering if there are any plans to reconsider the 1.5
per month rate this year given what we've seen with sales and the dwindling backlog.
<A - W. James McNerney>: We were pleased to see that the cargo market growth has accelerated and this last quarter
is up. Our best analysis as we sit here today says that the marketplace will support the rates that we have in place. The
macro picture is improving. We'll just have to look at it every quarter and make the right decision for The Boeing
Company. But for right now we see – we think we're in the right spot.

Next we go to Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Dominic.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: I wanted to ask about the 737 market share. Obviously, the 737 MAX is doing extremely well,
but you started a year behind the A320neo. And the expectation was that basically sales of the A320neo would taper off
and sales of the 737 MAX would catch up. But looking at market share now, the A320neo is showing no signs of
waning. They just had that huge order from IndiGo. And it looks like 737s at 40% market share. We've also got news
that Airbus may be looking at a longer-range version of the A321, which may make it even more attractive. So you've
always insisted you'll end up at 50:50 or approximately that. Can you elaborate on where that's going and how you see
that happening?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Dominic, you were breaking up a little bit. I think I got the question. Our view of where
it will end up based on our discussions with customers, based on our pipeline, hasn't changed. You're right. We started
a year and a half behind the other guys. If you look at the trajectory of where we are at a similar point in time where
they were, we're right – we're in a similar place. So market share will be what market share will be, but our view hasn't
changed on that at all.

Our next question is from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Jim, it seems as though the Partnering for Success percentages that you stated a little earlier on the
call haven't really changed much in the last few quarters. We keep hearing it's roughly a third are engaged, a third are in
the converting stage, and a third have yet to engage. Can you explain why that's not – we're not yet seeing any real shift
in getting more suppliers into the tent?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I didn't mean to leave the impression that we're not making progress because we are. I
think if you take a granular look, a number of our partners are working with us on a Partnering for Success basis. So I
didn't want to leave the impression we're not making progress. We are. And I think it would be fair to say that over the
last three to four months that another 10% of our partners have started working with us on a concrete basis. Maybe that
is a better way to answer that question.

<A - Thomas J. Downey>: Operator, we have one last question in the queue and we'll take that now.

That will be from Steve Wilhelm with the Puget Sound Business Journal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: I was interested in the 11.2% margin in BCA. Could you put a little historical context on that?
Is that a record or a near record? And if it was higher in the past, what factors made it happen then relative to now?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Certainly we had a strong quarter, and it really went across all the production programs. I
haven't gone back and looked at whether it was a record or not, but it certainly goes to the focus that team has on
driving the productivity and even to Jim's question prior on Partnering for Success. And we're starting to see the benefit
of that, so just solid execution across the board.
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: Okay.
