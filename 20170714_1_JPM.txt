MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second quarter 2017 earnings call. This call is
being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation, please
stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief
Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is
available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.
Starting on page 1, the Firm reported record net income of $7 billion, EPS of $1.82, and a return on tangible common
equity of 14%, on revenue of $26.4 billion. Included in the result is a legal benefit of approximately $400 million
after-tax from a previously announced settlement involving the FDIC's Washington Mutual Receivership.
Other notable items, predominantly net reserve changes and legal expense, were a small net negative this quarter, so
underlying adjusted performance was really strong. And highlights for the quarter include: average core loan growth of
8% year on year, reflecting continued growth across products; double-digit Consumer deposit growth; strong Card
sales, up 15%, and merchant volume up 12%; #1 global IB fees, up 10%; and we delivered record net income in both
Commercial Banking and in Asset & Wealth Management.
Moving on to page 2 and some more details about the quarter. Revenue of $26.4 billion was up $1.2 billion, or 5% year
on year, with the increase predominantly in Net Interest Income, up approximately $900 million, reflecting continued

loan growth and the impact of higher rates.
Fee revenue was up $300 million year on year, but adjusting for one-time items in both years was down modestly, with
lower Fixed Income Markets, Mortgage and Card revenue, all as guided, being offset by strong fee revenue growth
across remaining businesses.
Adjusted expense of $14.4 billion, was up a little less than $400 million year on year, with Auto leases being the
biggest driver, but also including the impact of the FDIC surcharge and broader growth, being offset by lower
compensation.
Credit costs of $1.2 billion, were down $187 million year on year, on lower reserve build, as a net reserve build in
Consumer of a little over $250 million, driven by Card, was offset by a net release in Wholesale of a little under $250
million, driven by Energy.
Anticipating you may have questions, given the recent stress in oil prices, I would emphasize that we guided to expect
reserve releases given we started the year with $1.5 billion of Energy-related reserves. And with oil prices having found
a lower but seemingly stable level, we feel appropriately reserved.
Shifting to balance sheet and capital on page 3. You can see in the red circle on the page here that we ended the quarter
with binding Fully Phased-In CET1 of 12.5%, under the Standardized approach, with the improvement being primarily
driven by capital generation, offset by net loan growth. We've been hovering around the inflection point under the
Collins Floor for a while now, and expect Standardized to remain our binding constraint from here. Given that, we've
replicated this page under Standardized rules in the appendix for you to read.
Balance sheet, Risk-Weighted Assets, and SLR all remained relatively flat from the prior quarter. And while not on the
page, I would also note that we remain compliant with all liquidity requirements.
We were pleased to announce gross repurchase capacity of up to $19.4 billion over the next four quarters. And the
Board announced its intention to increase common stock dividends 12% to $0.56 a share, effective in the third quarter.
In addition, we recently submitted our 2017 Resolution Plan, which we believe fully addresses outstanding regulatory
feedback.
Moving on to page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $2.2 billion of net income and an ROE of
16.5%. We continue to grow core loans, up 9% year on year, driven by strength in Mortgage, up 12%. Card and
Business Banking were each up 8%. And Auto loans and leases were also up 8%, driven by strong lease performance
from our manufacturing partners.
Deposit growth continues to be strong, up 10% year on year, with household retention remaining at historically high
levels. We saw improvement in our deposit margin, up 16 basis points. Sales growth in Card was very strong again this
quarter, up 15%, as new accounts mature. And merchant processing volumes grew double digits, up 12%.
Revenue of $11.4 billion was flat year on year, but recall that last year included a net benefit of about $200 million,
principally driven by the Visa Europe gain. So excluding that, revenue was up modestly. Consumer & Business
Banking revenue was up 13%, on both strong deposit growth and margin expansion. Mortgage revenue was down 26%,
as higher rates drove higher funding costs, which together with lower MSR risk management and lower production
margins put pressure on Mortgage revenue year on year. In addition, revenue included a reduction of approximately
$75 million to Net Interest Income, related to capitalized interest on modified loans.
And Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was down 3%, but if you exclude the non-core items I mentioned, sic
[revenue] was up 2%, with NII growth on higher loan balances and higher auto lease income, predominantly offset by
the continued impact of investments in Card new account acquisitions.
Expense of $6.5 billion was up 8% year on year, on higher auto lease depreciation, higher marketing expense, and
continued underlying business growth.

Finally, on credit performance, Card services drove higher net charge-offs year on year, but still within our guidance
for the full year of less than 3%. Net reserve builds were around $250 million, building $350 million in Card, $50
million in Business Banking, and $25 million in Auto, in part due to loan growth and in part higher loss rates in Card.
This was partially offset by a release of $175 million in Mortgage, reflecting continued improvement in home prices
and lower delinquencies.
To touch on consumer delinquency trends, in particular in Card, we are seeing some key signs of normalization, which
are generally in line with our expectations and our credit risk appetite. And in Auto, our trends are relatively flat.
Now turning to page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.7 billion, on revenue of
$8.9 billion and an ROE of 14.5%. In Banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion, was up 14% year on year, with strong
performance across products, but particular strength in DCM. We ranked #1 in global IB fees and #1 in North America
and EMEA. We were also #1 in ECM and DCM globally, in each case gaining share for the first half of this year.
Advisory fees were up 8%, benefiting from a large number of deals closing this quarter. Equity underwriting fees were
up 29%, better than the market, but relative to a weak prior-year quarter. With a strong market backdrop and supportive
valuations, we saw continued momentum in global issuance, especially IPOs. And Debt underwriting fees were up 5%,
from a strong quarter last year, driven by the high flow volume of repricing and refinancing activity even with fewer
large acquisition financings.
In terms of the outlook, we expect IB fees in the second half of the year to be down year on year, given that we had the
highest IB fees on record for a third quarter last year. That said, overall sentiment remains positive. ECM issuance is
expected to continue given the stable market backdrop, and the M&A backlog is healthy, with conditions remaining
constructive for refinancing activity.
Treasury Services revenue of $1.1 billion, was up 18%, driven by higher rates, as well as operating deposit growth.
Lending revenue of $373 million, was up 35%, reflecting lower mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans.
Moving on to Markets, total revenue was $4.8 billion, down 14% year on year. Fixed income revenue was down 19%,
with decent performance across products, relative to a very strong second quarter last year, which was driven by higher
levels of volatility and activity broadly, including as a result of Brexit. This quarter conversely can be characterized by
a lack of idiosyncratic events, resulting in sustained low volatility, reduced flows, and continued credit spread
tightening, all of which impacted activity levels in Rates, Credit trading, and Commodities. Emerging markets
performance was relatively stronger on a weaker dollar and lower rates, as well as some regional events.
Equities revenue was down 1%. In Derivatives, on the structured side we did quite well and outperformed, and on the
flow end, we held our own in a quiet and therefore challenging environment. Prime was a bright spot, as we are
realizing the benefit of the investments we've been consistently making.
Before I move on, I would also like to remind you that the third quarter of 2016 Markets revenue was also a record
since 2010. In fact, it was about $1 billion more than the average of the previous five years. And so while that isn't
guidance, it is context, as this quarter has felt quiet, more like prior years.
Securities Services revenue of $982 million was up 8%, driven by higher rates and higher asset-based fees, on higher
market levels. And remember, the second quarter benefits from dividend seasonality.
Finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 5% year on year, driven by lower compensation expense and a
comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 28%.
Moving on to page 6 and Commercial Banking. Another quarter of excellent performance, with record revenue and net
income, and an ROE of 17%. Revenue grew 15%, driven by deposit NII, as the rate environment continues to be
favorable and on higher loan balances, with spreads remaining steady. IB revenue was down due to the lack of large
deal activity during the quarter, but underlying flow activity was solid across products, as momentum continued, and
forward pipelines appear strong.

Expense of $790 million was up 8%, and we expect this to grow modestly in the second half, as we continue to execute
on the investments in bankers and technology that we outlined at Investor Day.
Loan balances were up 12% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter. C&I loans were up 4% sequentially, ahead of the
industry, on broad-based growth across markets and within specialized industries. CRE saw growth of 2%, in line with
the industry, but below last year's pace, on reduced origination activity, as we continue to be selective at this stage in
the cycle. Finally, credit performance remains very strong, with a net charge-off rate of 2 basis points.
Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. Asset & Wealth
Management reported record net income of $624 million, with pre-tax margin of 32% and an ROE of 27%. Revenue of
$3.2 billion, was up 9% year on year, driven primarily by higher market levels, but also strong banking results on
higher deposit NII. Expense of $2.2 billion, was up 4% year on year, driven by a combination of higher external fees
and compensation on higher revenue.
This quarter we saw net long-term inflows of $9 billion, with positive flows across multi-asset, fixed income, and
alternatives, being partially offset by outflows in equity products. We saw net liquidity outflows of $7 billion, largely
due to specific client deal related cash needs. Record AUM of $1.9 trillion and overall client assets of $2.6 trillion were
both up 11% year on year, on higher market levels. Deposits were flat year on year and down 5% sequentially,
reflecting the beginning of balance migration into investment related assets, as expected, and those balances remained
with us. Finally, loan balances were up 9% year on year, driven by mortgage, up nearly 20%.
Moving on to page 8 and Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $570 million, which includes the legal benefit I
mentioned earlier of $645 million in revenue or $400 million after tax. And a reminder, this is the same $645 million
that was publicly announced in August 2016 and represents partial reimbursement for costs that we've previously
incurred and paid that remain the responsibility of the WaMu receivership.
Finally, turning to page 9 and the outlook. Starting with the quarter, we guided second quarter NII to be up about $400
million from the first quarter, given the March rate hike, but you'll see that the NII for the quarter increased by only
$150 million. While we did fully realize the expected benefit of higher rates and continued growth, against that we had
the one-time $75 million mortgage adjustment, as well as lower CIB Markets NII. These effects together with modest
downward pressure from lower 10-year rates, with all other things equal, point to a full-year number of closer to $4
billion up, rather than the previous $4.5 billion, but with the potential to be higher if we continue to benefit from
tailwinds of lower deposit reprice.
So you will see we have adjusted the guidance on the page, but it will be market dependent. And any near-term forecast
is sensitive to a number of factors, none of which changes our conviction that we will ultimately deliver $11
billion-plus of incremental NII as rates normalize, and we are well on our way.
On expense, we continue to expect full-year adjusted expense of $58 billion. Second quarter was in line with our
expectation and our guidance, at a little better than $14.5 billion, which is also where we expect the third quarter to
come in.
Finally, we have revised our full-year core loan growth down to 8% year over year, but a couple of comments. First, we
are seeing slightly lower growth than we expected coming into the year. It is only modestly lower. And more
importantly, we remain encouraged by the consistency and breadth of client demand across products.
Secondly, we noted that Mortgage could be a big driver, and with a smaller market and a more competitive
environment, fewer loans have met our hurdle rate. And of course, we remain appropriately focused on quality and not
quantity of growth, and as such loan growth is an outcome, not a target.
So to wrap up, we are very pleased with the Firm's performance this quarter, with all of our businesses showing broad
strength. We maintained or improved leadership positions and are delivering the benefits to both clients and
shareholders of our operating model and our continued investments. We remain encouraged by the growth outlook for
the global economy, and expect continued solid growth here in the U.S., which positions us well going forward.
With that, operator, you can open up the line for Q&A.

Q&A
Operator
[Audio Break] (17:50 – 18:11) ...from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hello there. How are you?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: During the quarter, Jamie had made a comment on potential disruptions related to the unwinding
of the U.S. balance sheet. And I'm just curious, it's supposed to be slow and deliberate, but I'm curious how you think
that impacts liquidity, the yield curve, trading, deposit betas. And is there anything you can do to protect JPMorgan
against those disruptions?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I would just stop for a second to just point out that what Jamie actually said was this is
uncharted territory. It's not something that we've seen before. And so while it is the case that the Fed is communicating
clearly and has every intention to make this gradual and predictable, things can change, and we should just be prepared
for that. Not to say that that would have a particularly significant impact necessarily on JPMorgan, but that that would
just be a downside risk, not a probability.
So on the balance sheet, it's still the case that we expect to start seeing normalization in the balance sheet in September,
if not in September, by the end of this year, we're still actually calling for the next rate hike in December. The market is
calling for March of next year. And as we said, the communication has been pretty consistent and pretty clear across
the Fed space, which is to say that it's mostly priced into the market at this point as far as we can tell.
And so based upon what we've understood, all things equal, we would see the balance sheet shrink about $1.5 trillion
over about the next four years. So that would ultimately slow growth, not stop growth. And if we saw $1.5 trillion
come out of the Fed's balance sheet, empirical evidence would suggest that we don't see a dollar-for-dollar reduction in
deposits. So if you just pick a point between $500 billion and $1 trillion of deposit outflows, at our 10% market share
that would be about $75 billion over four years. So it would slow growth. It would not stop growth. And it is what
we've been expecting and what we've been talking about now for an extended period, and gradually it's good in that
sense.
In respect of which deposits we would like to see, so that's the sort of post-scenario. In terms of liquidity, again,
evidence would suggest, and we've been communicating this quite clearly, that we think the preponderance of that
deposit outflow would be Wholesale deposits and it would be non-operating deposits. And those are deposits we
ascribe little to no liquidity value to. So assuming that we're close to right, we would see those deposits ultimately leave
the system, but it wouldn't affect materially, if at all, our liquidity position.
So ultimately, the yield curve has priced, I think, all of this in. What I think the Fed's been clear about is that they
expect the balance sheet, or hope the balance sheet to be in the background and to use short rates as their primary
monetary policy tool. And so as a result, we would ultimately expect to see perhaps a flattening yield curve, but with
the front end ultimately pulling the long end up. And you heard Chair Yellen talk about being conscious of the shape of
the curve as they go about normalization. I think you may have asked about something else. Did I miss anything?
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: No, that was absolutely awesome. I do have one tiny follow-up. I always get a little more than I
wanted there, thank you. The one tiny follow-up, Marianne, is I just want to make it clear the whole $4 billion versus
$4.5 billion, and you spelled out what happened in the quarter. It sounded like most of that full-year guidance happened
in this second quarter, but I just want to clarify that. In terms of the second half NII, do you think it's overly different
from where we were a quarter ago?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, that's correct. If you saw that compared to a $400 million expectation, we were up $150
million, so it would be fair to say that most of it was in this quarter. When we gave the last set of guidance at $4.5

billion, we pointed out that the 10-year was low and that that was ultimately pressuring that $4.5 billion. So it really
isn't that significant of a change.
The only thing I would caution you to remember is that when we think about asset sensitivity and we think about
market NII, which we wouldn't consider to be in the traditional sense core, can exhibit volatility geographically with
NIR. If you think about a market-making business, where we can have assets that are throwing off NII, hedged by
derivatives that ultimately have an offset in NIR, we actually think about that in total revenue numbers. So there could
be a little noise in there, but no, I'm not expecting there to be significant changes.
But I think what this makes me realize acutely is that no good deed ever goes unpunished, and chasing our tails
reforecasting the full-year NII every three quarters isn't as important – or every quarter isn't as important as keeping our
eye on the long term, which is nothing has changed. We are absolutely realizing the benefits we expected in the
banking book of assets and liabilities. And that means that our long-term projections will be good, and the path is a
little bit less important.
Operator
And your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Hi. Good morning, Marianne. So thanks for that clarity on the trading-related NII. I wanted to
follow up on the loan yield side, which not much moved. You mentioned the $75 million in Mortgage. Can you just
help us walk through the loan portfolio and whether you're seeing the assets move and whether there's a lag or whether
there's any spread compression underneath that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I understand why you're asking. If you look at the loan yields, they look relatively flat or
even slightly down. If you adjust for the Mortgage, it would be flat. If you decompose them into Wholesale versus
Retail, we are absolutely seeing all of the yield improvement on the Wholesale side, about 10-ish basis points. And on
the Consumer side, with respect to this quarter, there were some mix impacts in the Card business as we saw a higher
level of transactors, and so a few other things. So it's not to say that the loan yields aren't moving in line with our
expectations, and they are, but mix will matter for any one quarter.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. So would that naturally say that as we go forward that should – if they're moving the right
way, mix adjusted, they should move the right way from here?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, that's right. And if you look back last quarter, they did too.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Yes, okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's just that we had a couple of opposing things going on this quarter.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Understood, okay. And then my second question is it was nice to see the Card revenues on the fee
side and the revenue capture rate move towards the way you've been saying. It actually eclipsed the 10.5% you had said
for the year already. Can you just help us understand? Have we turned the corner then on Card income and your
expectations for that going forward? Thanks.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. So obviously, one of the biggest drivers over the last recent while in Card revenues has
been the extraordinary success we've had in capturing new Chase Sapphire Reserve accounts. And so the end of the
third quarter, but importantly both the fourth quarter and the first quarter were extraordinary in terms of the number of
accounts they acquired. And of course, we amortized or contra-revenued those expenses over one year.
So at a 10.5% revenue rate right now and with having adjusted the premium with those originations stabilizing out into
the second quarter, we will see ultimately we'll lap that impact a year from now, and we'll see our revenue rates start
improving from here towards the 11.25% that we guided to in the medium term, and we expect to get to that point, all
other things equal, mid next year.

And of course, that's just one facet. We're also seeing significant momentum on the sales front, obviously, as a result of
those accounts. We're growing core loans up 8%, and so we're having higher NII on those balances. So there's a lot of
dry powder. We just need to get past these account acquisition costs, which we will.
Operator
And our next question...
<A - Marianne Lake>: And I'm also compelled to point out that these are extraordinarily good customers, their
characteristics, their engagement, their spend. These are the customers that everybody wants to acquire. We now have
them, and we intend to deepen relationships with them.
Operator
Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hey, two questions, one on M&A strategy. I know there was some discussion that maybe you
were interested in acquiring something. That's not really the question to comment on that specific rumor. But more in
this regulatory environment and the changes that we've had already, do you feel like there's a little more flexibility for
your strategic actions or outlook than maybe a year ago?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would characterize our strategy as unchanged. We've always been pretty consistent over
an extended period that we would prioritize first and foremost strategic investments for growth in our businesses, be
that organic or otherwise. And obviously, you've seen us be investing, whether it's in growing loans or introducing new
products, hiring bankers, opening offices in our expansion markets and the like. But yes, it's been heavily skewed to
being organic over the most recent while.
We've also been pretty clear and active, I would say in terms of partnering with, investing in, collaborating with
partners that can accelerate our growth potential. So we would always be interested, whether that's FinTech or
otherwise, in getting capabilities that allow us to accelerate our growth potential. We don't have big gaps, but we would
always be interested in that. Having said that, I'm not going to comment on the state of the regulatory environment
except to say you should expect for any of these events or transactions that we would have the appropriate regulators at
the – conversation with regulators at the appropriate time.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Second question is on – a little bit of a ticky-tacky but on FASB. They're working on changing
some of the hedge accounting rules. And I wondered how you're thinking about areas in your balance sheet you might
be able to utilize that in a way that makes your business more efficient. I don't know if that's something that you're
thinking about.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so obviously we are supportive of the new hedge accounting rules, and it will allow us to
consider taking advantage of hedge accounting for a wider set of products than we currently do. But we actually have
reasonably limited hedge ineffectiveness in our P&L right now. So from a practical perspective, it won't make a big
difference to the business, but it is more flexibility in terms of the scope, and we're looking at that.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I would just add as a policy matter, we make economic decisions, not accounting decisions.
Accounting is a fiction. Marianne spoke about the credit card. You expense the acquisition costs over 12 months. The
benefit comes over seven years. So we make huge investments all the time based on economics, and we'll never make a
decision based upon accounting. And then we'll describe it to our shareholders. Do you understand why we're doing
what we're doing?

Our next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John McDonald>: Hi, Marianne. I wanted to ask about the credit cards fee. The outlook for charge-offs remains
the same at about below 3% for the year, and you're about...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - John McDonald>: ...3% now in the first half. So maybe you're expecting a little bit of improvement in the back
half of the year. Is that seasonal?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, it's seasonality. So you've seen the first half at or around that guidance level. We would
expect that to go down slightly due to some seasonality in the second half for a full year, a bit below 3%.
<Q - John McDonald>: And then at Investor Day, the outlook for the medium term was not much higher, 3% to
3.25%. Does that allow for the seasoning over the next year or two of all the growth that you've had and allow for some
normalization too? Is that enough cushion to get all that in there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would say obviously, anytime you reach an inflection point, you need to be cautious about
understanding the pace of change. At least for 2018, 3% to 3.25% feels right. I think when you get beyond that, we'll be
updating you with our views as we experience a bit more in reality. It doesn't feel significantly different from that, but I
think 2018 is a good number, and 2019 we'll update you.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay, thanks.

Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Erika Najarian>: Yes, good morning. I just wanted to follow up to the questions that Glenn and Ken had on
margin. Marianne, could you give us a little bit of insight on how deposit betas trended Wholesale versus Retail during
the quarter? And also just going back to your comments, if the Fed balance sheet reduction drives Wholesale deposits
out of the system, can we assume that that should not affect deposit betas negatively for JPMorgan?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, okay. So to just talk about what we've seen so far, I think the industry has been really
quite disciplined, which is what we would have expected at this early stage of a normalization, in terms of the rate
cycle, it is a tale of two cities. We said that this quarter the Wholesale space necessarily experiences higher reprice
more quickly, and we are seeing that pretty much in line with our expectations. It matters. You need to get granular.
The type of deposit, the client segmentation, it matters. So in the Wholesale space, we're seeing it. We're on that
journey. In the Retail space, we haven't seen that yet. So while there have been small changes in the industry in CDs,
there's been nothing in checking or savings. But again, I'd just point out to you that we wouldn't have expected there to
be at this point yet in the cycle.
And I would say with respect to deposit betas and the Fed's balance sheet, if we are right and we believe we'll be close
to right and that we see the wholesale non-operating deposits flowing out of the system assuming everybody else has
reached that same conclusion, then it shouldn't really materially impact the liquidity position of Financial Institutions.
And if you couple that with the expectation of a very gradual and measured pace, which gives people a lot of time and
opportunity to plan accordingly, we wouldn't expect there to be a significant impact on beta, if any.
<Q - Erika Najarian>: Thank you. And my second question, you mentioned at the beginning of the call that
Standardized will ultimately be your CET1 binding constraint, and I'm wondering, if you were allowed to float off your

current op risk floor, and I think it's still $400 billion, does that mean if Standardized is your constraint that being able
to float off the floor and model out your op risk may not be an incremental source of capital because Standardized is
binding?
<A - Marianne Lake>: First of all, I would say focusing on any one – so we would be very supportive of changes to
how operational risk capital is treated under reg capital rules. But I think focusing on one facet and not the whole thing,
it's unlikely to be that only one thing changes. So we'd like to see changes made over time. But for the foreseeable
future, as we are growing our loans quite strongly and these are extraordinarily high-quality loans where the differential
between Advanced and Standardized is quite big, we still expect Standardized to bind us.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And as you point out, at Standardized we're at 100% in the United States. In Europe, they're
talking about 75%, so there will be some changes over time in how all these capital ratios get calculated for
international competitiveness reasons.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. So whether it's because the operational risk rules change or whether it's because the
Standardized rules become at least somewhat more risk-sensitive, there should be changes over time. But I think for the
foreseeable future, this is what we expect.

Our next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Hi, good morning. First question is on Commercial Banking. Can you just comment a bit on the
sustainability of the growth in profitability you've had there? Your earnings are up 30% year on year, loan growth C&I
9%, CRE up 15%. And we're not talking about small numbers anymore. I think your loan book now is about $200
billion in Commercial Banking. Can you maybe just talk about some of the initiatives that you've discussed of the
Middle Market, the IB, and how sustainable that is, and whether you're comfortable with the risk profile of the book
you have there? Because you are growing quickly, it is a big book now, and you're certainly growing faster than the
industry.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would start with if you go back a couple of years ago, 2013, 2014, 2015, when we were
doing our business simplification agenda and de-risking and uplifting the controlled environment, the Commercial
Bank was blocking and tackling and doing a lot of inwardly focused work. And we talked I think all the way back in
2016, that the outbound calls, opening offices, hiring bankers, and that if you waited a minute you'd see that come to
our results, and this is the fruits of that labor. So I do think it is sustainable. There's nothing in these results that is
particularly noisy outside of reserve releases, which I'll come back to.
I would also say the partnership between the Commercial Bank and the IB in terms of covering our clients, the
introduction of 16 specialized industries, which is an advantage we can bring to our clients nationally and in fact
globally that other competitors can't bring, all of those things set us up for continued solid growth.
With respect to loan growth, I would say if you look at our C&I loans, this quarter as an example was pretty
broad-based. There wasn't a specific – in the Middle Market, there wasn't a specific industry or market segment that
was strong, but over the last – stronger, I should say. But over the last few years, a lot of our growth has been driven by
the investments we've been making in the expansion markets. So we got into some new markets with the WaMu
acquisition. We continue to build out those markets, add bankers, open offices, and that has been a sort of growth for us
that perhaps others haven't been able to enjoy, and also, as I said, specialized industries. And then...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I would just add; I think we're in all major 50 markets now.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Unlike Retail, where one day we'll embark on expansion in cities we're not in. And the product
set is just fabulous. We're adding more and more online things. We're adding simpler and faster credit approvals. We're
making it easy to do merchant processing when you sign up for Middle-Market loans. The online systems are great. So

all that stuff, I think this is going to grow for a long period of time, and thanks for pointing out how well it did. And,
Doug Petno, if you're listening, congratulations.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Yes, no problem.
<A - Marianne Lake>: The only thing I would say on Commercial Real Estate, just because I think it's really
important, is Commercial Real Estate, it depends what you do. And more than half of our Commercial Real Estate
exposure is commercial term lending. It's a very specific strategy. We don't deviate from that strategy. And I would just
point to you because it was interesting to me. If you look at the Fed's CCAR stress results, the Commercial Real Estate
across the industry, and look at how our results compared to others, I think you can hopefully get somewhat more
comfortable, and we are very comfortable with what we have right now.
Now that said, the performance of course did benefit from reserve releases and benign credit, and at some point there
will be a cycle. But the risk appetite we have and the way we have managed risk discipline, we're very happy with that.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And the IB, bringing JPMorgan Investment Banking to Chase corporate clients we still think it
has a long way to go.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: That's great, thank you. If I can follow up with a bigger picture question and, Jamie, you've
been, and correct me if I'm wrong, you've been pretty vocal about believing that the underpinnings of our economy are
healthy and strong and not buying into the whole secular stagnation argument. But at what point does political
dysfunction and political paralysis really start to dent that confidence? Because you've also indicated that we do need
structural reform to lift trend growth, whether it's infrastructure, tax reform, whatever it is. And can you just comment
on that?
And I guess as an adjunct to that, what are your conversations with clients like? Is there a risk that is materializing that
clients are also starting to become more frustrated with the lack of progress politically?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I would look at it the other way around. So since the Great Recession, which is now eight years
old, we've been growing at 1.5% to 2% in spite of stupidity and political gridlock because the American business sector
is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless. When people wake up in the morning, they went to feed their
kids. They want to buy a home. They want to do things the same as American businesses. What I'm saying is that it
would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and were there not gridlock. And thank you for
pointing it out because I'm going to be a broken record until this gets done. We are unable to build bridges. We're
unable to build airports our inner city school kids are not graduating.
I was just in France. I was recently in Argentina. I was in Israel. I was in Ireland. We met with the Prime Minister of
India and China. It's amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies that
promote business and growth is good for the average citizens of those countries for jobs and wages, and that somehow
this great American free enterprise system, we no longer get it. And so my view is that corporate taxation is critical to
that, by the way. We've been driving capital and bringing it overseas, which is why there's $2 trillion sitting overseas,
benefiting all these other countries and stuff like that. So if we don't get our act together, we can still grow. It's
unfortunate, but it's hurting us. It's hurting the body politic. It's hurting the average American that we don't have these
right policies. And so no, in spite of gridlock, we'll grow at maybe 1.5% or 2%.
I don't buy the argument that we'll relegated to this forever. We're not, if this administration can make breakthroughs in
taxes and infrastructure, regulatory reform, we have become one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies
on the planet. It's almost an embarrassment being an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the
stupid (expletive) we have to deal with in this country. And at one point, we all have to get our act together or we won't
do what we're supposed to do for the average Americans. And unfortunately, people write about this thing like it's for
corporations. It's not for corporations. Competitive taxes are important for business and business growth, which is
important for jobs and wage growth. And honestly, we should be ringing that alarm bell, every single one of you every
time you talk to a client.

<A - Marianne Lake>: And then I would just say that in terms of how our clients are behaving and how the dialogue
is going, whether you look at Middle Market, Corporate Client Banking, M&A, it's not to say that the possibilities of
performing and the impacts that could have isn't a part of the dialogue, but they're fundamentally really just getting on
with things. And so if there's a client that has a compelling strategic deal to be done or some spending or hiring or
growth, then they're pretty much getting on with it, which is why we are seeing solid growth.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: You guys obviously had a very big approval for a share buyback from the latest CCAR
here. And I just wanted your thoughts on terms of using it all, given where your stock price is, given loan growth has
slowed a tad, and given the flatter yield curve makes buying securities a little less interesting. How do you put that all
together?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so look. Obviously, you know the deal with CCAR approvals, which is it is capacity, it's
not necessarily a commitment to utilize it. Although we are, as we fairly clearly articulated at Investor Day and as you
see in the numbers here, we are at 12.5% in terms of our CET1. And we believe we ought to be able to over time
operate the company lower than that, within the range of 11% to 12.5%, albeit that we would take time to do that.
So we're in the market buying our stock every day. We're at 1.8x tangible book value. You saw it in Jamie's shareholder
letter. We still think that there's significant value in the stock, we believe in the earnings power and the franchise that
we have here. And so not to say that we'll utilize all the capacity because other things can come up, but we put in the
request based upon our desire to want to ultimately move lower.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yes and there's a very important policy issue here too. So our preference is always to build
organically, to not buy back stock, but to build branches and grow and lend more. But there's an argument that people
are making that banks can't lend it, and even if there's excess lending capability they wouldn't have done it, and that is
not true.
The counter-factual would have been had banks been free to use their capital and their liquidity five years ago, there
would have been a lot more lending in the system. We pointed out two areas where it would have taken place. One is
mortgages, where regulations have held back lending to first-time buyers, immigrants, self-employed, prior defaults, et
cetera. And the second is small business, where it's not existing small businesses. Think of it as startup small
businesses. And they are having a hard time getting capital, maybe at the community bank level et cetera. The
counter-factual would have been that $1 trillion or $2 trillion would have been lent out had these rules have been
changed five years ago. That's the counter-factual. It's not that, well, the banks wouldn't have lent the money and so
again, there's a false notion that all this stuff didn't hold back the economy. Yes, it did.

<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Good. Can you give us some color? Federal Reserve Chairwoman Yellen indicated that she
sees that there could be some relief on the horizon for the banks. And one of the areas that's been talked about is
changing the calculation of the SLR. Have you guys modeled out what that could do to your SLR and then how that
may change your view on capital going forward, if there are changes where, for example, they take the cash that's
sitting at the central banks out of the equation?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so obviously, they haven't been specific. Although the Treasury report had some ideas,
they haven't been specific about what the calibration would look like and whether there would be recalibration to the
numerator and the denominator or one or the other. Clearly, we've been pretty clear that we think cash at central banks
shouldn't necessarily be included, and there are other things, different people have different opinions.
So we've done the calculations. I would just point you back to the fact that we have some 20 potentially binding
constraints right now, of which leverage in a variety of forms is part of that. So to the degree that we get the
opportunity to recalibrate that, it could have impact at the margin, but we take all of those things into consideration
when we think about the direction of travel of the company.
So we're being as thoughtful as we can. We're not specifically leverage constrained right now. That doesn't mean we're
not supportive of making those changes. And we will obviously model it out. But we take the potential for those
changes into consideration when we think about the direction we grow our businesses.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Very good. And then as a follow-up, coming back to credit cards, obviously Sapphire has been
a huge success in growing your business there. Are the acquisition costs higher today than when you compare them to
maybe two or three years ago? And in that vein, when you guys look at the economics of putting on new cards, is the
net present value or whatever measure you use to determine the economics, has that improved, stayed the same, or
weakened from maybe a year or two ago?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I think I want to point out something because I know that Sapphire Reserve gets a
significant amount of attention for obvious and good reasons, but it is only one product in a platform of successful
products, both proprietary and co-brand. And so in reality, while we obviously do all the modeling and the math, it's
not about what the cost of any one individual card acquired is or the NPV of that is, how the portfolios ultimately
together perform over time, and it's still very early on Sapphire Reserve. It's not even a year old yet, and these are
portfolios and products that develop and season over time. And as I said, these are extraordinarily good customer
relationships.
So you know we've done a bunch of things in the Card business over the last few years. We've renegotiated our
co-brands. That was ultimately with lower economics but still very good economics. We've been out on the front foot
issuing new products, not just Sapphire Reserve, but Freedom Unlimited, the Amazon Prime card, Ink. And so we think
about everything in the total portfolio and its collective performance over time, and it's still generating very good
returns.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: If I could just mention about the regulatory SLR, so look at it very broadly. If you look at – it's
not just capital liquidity, but mortgage rules, requirements, capital liquidity, collateral rules, what collateral can be used
and not used. If these things were just calibrated differently, the cost of credit would go down, swap spreads would go
down, mortgage would become more available, the cost of mortgages would come down, and those are kind of
important in total if they're done right, without changing at all the risk to the system. In fact, the system is healthier if
the economy is healthier.

<Q - Steven Chubak>: Hi, good morning. So, Marianne, I wanted to start off with a question on liquidity. You spoke

current capacity to deploy some of that excess into higher-yielding MBS? And maybe what's your appetite to redeploy,
just given some of the tougher liquidity treatment for agency MBS, in particular?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So when we think about the liquidity position of this company, we're obviously managing not
just to regulatory requirements but also to what we want the ultimate duration of equity and position of our balance
sheet to be through the cycle. So we take into consideration not just the amount of liquidity we have and how that could
be utilized, but also the mortgage portfolio we have, agency MBS. So all of that goes into our determinations, and we
will continue to add to duration opportunistically when it makes sense to do it and manage our balance sheet with
discipline.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Okay, understood, and then just one more question for me just on capital targets. I appreciate
all the detail, Marianne, you provided indicating that over time there could be a path or trajectory towards getting to the
lower end of that 11% to 12.5% range. I'm just wondering. Given the very favorable CCAR results we saw this year
coupled with some of the Treasury reforms that have been outlined, is there the potential for you to actually manage to
a target even below that 11%, especially if gold-plating of GSIB surcharges in fact goes away?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would start by saying that a lot can change between now and the next cycle of CCAR or
the next two cycles of CCAR. And so we never did actually say that we necessarily wanted to the low the end of the
range, but just operate for the short to medium term within the range while we let all of the potential changes to the
regulatory environment at large play out.
And so as to whether or not over time there's a sort of recalibration of whether 11% is our minimum, that will play out
over time. So for the next one or two cycles of CCAR, this cycle and the next one, I would just expect that we want to
be on a measured pace to be within the range to allow us to better understand all of the changes that will take place over
time and make appropriate decisions. I wouldn't start imagining necessarily how low that goes. I think we would want
to operate with a sufficiency of capital and liquidity.
Operator
Our next question comes from Andrew Lim of SocGén.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Hi there, thanks for taking my questions. Coming back to the Treasury's proposals for the new
calculation of the SLR, can you give any color as to whether that's actually even possible within the global context as to
how the Basel Committee wouldn't want harmonization across the whole world? Of course, if it did happen, then you
would have a massive advantage along with other U.S. banks versus other European investment banks.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would say, of course, it's possible. We've seen a number of situations where implementing
global standards in the U.S. have differed in meaningful ways from how they've been implemented elsewhere. You
have rarely seen that be to the advantage of the U.S., and the SLR is no exception. So while there may be recalibrations
of either the numerator or the denominator, know that to the European 3% standard, our current depository institutions
are held to a 6% standard. So there's plenty of room for there to be adjustments before it would create an unlevel
playing field. And my suspicion is there will also be adjustments elsewhere. And it's supposed to be as I think
Chairwoman Yellen said, a backstop not binding in the way that perhaps it has become. So I think the answer is yes,
but we'll see.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The key point Marianne said is almost every single thing that's been done in America added to
Basel requirements, the gold-plating in SLR, calculation of LCR, calculation of stress, GSIB, almost every single thing.
And remember, America doesn't have to listen to Basel either. And you may have noticed that basically France,
Germany, India, China are [inaudible] Basel. They better take a deep breath and stop doing more of what they're doing.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Great, thanks. And just a follow-up question, also on the reduction in the op risk, you talked
about advances at standardized. Looking at the CCAR, your SLR as a binding constraint there, so isn't it really a moot
argument, a non-argument really as to whether that happens or not; i.e., if you reduce your op risk, it doesn't really
change your excess capital?

<A - Marianne Lake>: Sorry, go ahead.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Go ahead.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So look, there are a number of different people talking about forward-looking standards for
operational risk under Basel 3.5 or Basel IV or whatever, is talking about it. There were some proposals in the
CHOICE Act. So there's no question that there should be a revisitation of the mechanisms to calculate operational risk.
And then you're right, the way that all of these rules ultimately interplay with each other matters. And so from a pure
stress test perspective, at the margin we had a little bit more binding constraint on leverage than CET1. But if you look
at just what we could run the company at if CCAR was our only constraint, it would be lower than where we are. So it's
a complicated dynamic of trying to make sure that we are maximizing against all of these constraints, and not just the
mathematical ones, but also the operational and practical ones. So it's necessary to go back and rethink the calculation
of operational risk just because it's the right thing to do. Ultimately, how that plays out into how we optimize against
our constraints is less of what we're focused on.

Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hey, just two other quick things. One, on the accounting with hedges, just to get back on it, the
effect, a little bit, the question also was, was there any opportunity for your clients too? Because if there is an
opportunity for, say, institutions to hedge their books of business more, that could feed into your revenues?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I wouldn't imagine it. It's not going to change our risk management strategy in a meaningful
way, so I wouldn't imagine it would be.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: This affects corporations only? Does the new hedging rules affect other corporations or
non-banks?
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Yes, in the sense that you can potentially hedge your commodity risks, so would that be
something?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We haven't looked at whether it creates more demand from the corporate side, so we'll look at
that and see.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Yes, okay. And then is there a timeframe here where you have to start telling us what your LCR
is? I wasn't sure if that was coming up soon. Was that this quarter or next quarter? Has that just been put on hold?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, it is still this quarter. There are requirements to make public disclosures in August. So
depending on whether you make them in your 10-Q, in your Pillar 3 or not will determine whether it's the beginning or
middle or end of August. We, as you know, as an industry are being quite public about the fact that we think – by the
way, we provide an extraordinary amount of real-time same-day granular information on liquidity to our regulators in
order for them to be able to properly supervise not just us, but the system.
And so really, we believe the regulators do have and can have anything they need when they need it. It's just a question
about whether there is any added benefit of those information being made public near real-time. While it wouldn't
matter today when everyone is running very significant liquidity surpluses, it could have unintended consequences if
we were in an environment that was more stressful than we are today. So right now, the requirement is that we have to
disclose. I suspect although we've asked for a delay as an industry that we might have to disclose, we will continue to
debate I think with regulators, the merits of those public disclosures over time.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: I get that. I was just thinking that there's the opportunity to show us the non-operating deposits
going away, which would help people understand the strength of the deposit franchise.

<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, I would suggest, although it's not something we show you every quarter, that we've been
pretty forthcoming about showing you the level of our deposits and the split at least in Investor Day now and then
between operating and non-operating deposits. And as we start to see the impact of the Fed balance sheet unwind and
the like, we will be very forthcoming. We try to be incredibly transparent, and we'll take that under advisement
regardless of what the regulatory disclosures are about the quality of our deposit franchise. But we have I think
periodically been more disclosive than most in terms of the quality of our deposits.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Not only that, you could see that we have $500 billion of cash, $300 billion of securities, $300
billion of repo. It's a pretty liquid company, as liquid as any bank I've ever seen on this planet.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And we removed $200 billion of non-operating deposits proactively, so we manage it very
carefully.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: There's nothing that would happen because of all this that would affect JPMorgan that much.
And very important to LCR, it doesn't affect us. We're fine disclosing however they want us to disclose. It's an issue of
whether it is good for monetary policy and will it cause a problem, not for us, but the system when there's a crisis. Do
they want banks to use their liquidity or not? It's very simple. Because if the answer is you've got to maintain over
100%, then you can't use your liquidity. That's what it means.
And they've said publicly, someone said probably if there's a crisis, why don't you go below 100%? And we're saying
what bank is going to be the first to go below 100%? So it's a policy issue. Whatever happens, we're completely fine at
JPMorgan. If I was the regulators, I wouldn't want to put myself in that kind of position.
