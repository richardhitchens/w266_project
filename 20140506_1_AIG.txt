MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to AIG's First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being
recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth A. Werner

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our senior management team and we'll begin with comments from Bob
Benmosche.
Robert H. Benmosche
Thanks, Liz, and good morning everybody. I want to start with ILFC and to comment on the 8-K we filed yesterday
and that is all regulatory approvals have now been received. And so we're very confident that this transaction will
impact flows in the second quarter as we've talked to you previously. So that's a good note for the company going
forward.
If you look at the quarter, you can see that our capital management continues to proceed in a very measured way of
buying back shares and continuing to reduce our debt, which obviously improves our coverage ratio.
Our Property Casualty had its second best quarter in the last 12 quarters. Unfortunately, the best quarter was the first
quarter of last year. So, we're comparing the second best quarter to the best quarter, so you'll see some declines.
However, if you look at the accident year loss ratios and the other fundamentals, that business has continued to build a
very strong foundation for the future.
Our Mortgage Guaranty business continues to do well with 62% of its premium now coming from our new
underwriting capability, which really gives us high degree of confidence that if the market goes soft in the future, and I
know maybe we'll never see another soft market in housing, but if that day comes, we're confident we have a very
strong profile of risk that we've taken on our books in Mortgage Guaranty.
And Life and Retirement continues to show very strong premiums and deposits, $7.1 billion for the quarter, but also
very strong net flows. So it's not only what's coming in, it's what we're retaining. And so that business really is hitting
on all cylinders.
So, what I'd like to do now is turn it over to David, who will take you through the financials.
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone.
As we disclosed yesterday in the 8-K that Bob referenced, we've now received all regulatory approvals required with
respect to the sale of ILFC to AerCap. We do expect the transaction to close in the second quarter, and again, subject to
satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Upon closing, we expect to receive approximately $2.4 billion of cash,
that is net of inter-company settlements, plus 97.6 million shares of AerCap's stock, all of which will be held at the
Parent holding company and subject to lock up and other transfer provisions.
In the second quarter, we will update our stress tests, our liquidity forecasts, as well as our annual capital plan, and
we'll discuss all of these with the rating agencies, the federal reserve, and our board of directors to assess what actions
we will take.
Now turning to our financials on slide 4. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.8 billion, with operating
earnings per share of $1.21. Our operating return on equity was 7.5%. Since our earnings are tax affected and we are
not paying tax to the U.S. government given our NOLs, our operating ROE excluding the DTA from average equity
was about 180 basis points higher or about 9.3%. Book value per share excluding AOCI at the end of the quarter was
$65.49, 10% higher than it was in the first quarter of 2013.
Our operating results begin on slide 5. Peter and Jay will cover their respective businesses following my remarks. The
direct investment book, or the DIB, delivered another solid quarter with over $400 million of operating earnings,
reflecting the mark-to-market appreciation. That can create some volatility from period to period, as we had gains also
from unwinding certain of our positions. We continue to expect these earnings to moderate over time as the portfolio
winds down and the investments approach their expected recovery values.

In addition, we may from time to time repackage certain of the DIB assets to be held at the Parent company or in our
operating companies. We continue to proactively and opportunistically reduce the DIB's footprint. In fact, in the first
quarter, we settled the $2.2 billion of redemptions and repurchases previously announced, as well as initiated the
make-whole call for the March 2015 maturities, which was completed yesterday. We used cash allocated to the DIB
and Global Capital Markets that was set aside exactly for that purpose. At the end of the first quarter, we had $7.9
billion of net asset value in the DIB and Global Capital Markets. We expect this capital to be released to the Parent
over time, as the maturities of the liabilities and the underlying assets and derivatives are monetized and settled.
Corporate expenses totaled approximately $243 million in the quarter, in line with our expectation of a $225 million to
$250 million quarterly run rate for 2014. And they were down from a year ago, as expected. Our reported operating
effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.7%, also in line with our outlook for 2014.
Our strong capital position as of the end of the quarter is set forth on slide 6. Our capital structure remains
straightforward and our leverage remains low. As I mentioned last quarter, we made good progress on our coverage
ratios, which remains an area of focus for us that we continue to work on through opportunistic debt capital
management and improving earnings profile including the earnings profile of our core businesses.
From this strong capital position, we distributed $182 million in dividends to our shareholders and deployed $867
million towards the repurchase of approximately 17.4 million shares of common stock, leaving roughly $537 million
remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. We were opportunistic and orderly in our share repurchase
activity. We received dividends and loan repayments from Life and Retirement of about $1.7 billion during the quarter
as shown on slide 7; included in this amount is roughly $300 million related to subprime settlements.
Property Casualty is also on track to deliver its full year targeted dividend payments, although none was expected in the
first quarter. We continue to expect $5 billion to $6 billion in dividends and distributions from our insurance
subsidiaries this year. In addition to these dividends and distributions, we received tax-sharing payments of about $300
million in the first quarter. We continue to expect to receive approximately $1 billion of tax sharing payments in 2014
and roughly $2 billion in 2015, as this comes from our statutory – our insurance companies and they continue to utilize
their DTAs.
These dividends and tax sharing payments, combined with our capital management activity that I mentioned earlier,
resulted in Parent cash, short-term investments and unencumbered securities of $11.2 billion as of the end of the
quarter. Included in parental liquidity is $4.4 billion related to the DIB and Global Capital Markets, which is allocated
for its future debt maturities and contingent liquidity stress needs. As we've indicated in the past, nearly 80% of the
DIB's debt matures by the end of 2018.
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter for comments on Property Casualty.
Peter D. Hancock
Thank you, David, and good morning, everybody. Property Casualty's first quarter results reflected our continued focus
on underwriting discipline and risk selection. While we don't look at any one quarter as a trend, this was our second
highest quarter of pre-tax operating income over the past three years. Our strategic initiatives and outlook remain
unchanged, and we continue to focus on driving profitable growth and increasing returns.
Turning to slide 8, AIG Property Casualty reported first quarter operating income of $1.2 billion. Net premiums written
grew 3% from a year ago, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. We experienced strong new business growth across
the majority of our commercial lines. However, Casualty written premium volumes declined from a year ago on lower
exposures and slower payroll growth at our large accounts. Pricing discipline drove our rate actions and a willingness
to walk away from business where appropriate.
Property Casualty's accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 63.2, flat from a year ago and higher than our long-term
trend. Importantly, our view of a decline in the accident year loss ratio in 2014 has not changed. First quarter operating

results were also impacted by three large consumer losses and strong alternative investment performance, which I'll
address in my remarks.
The quarter included $162 million of net prior-year adverse development primarily related to our International
Financial Lines business, as well as certain specialty lines. We continue to review reserve quarterly and react quickly to
any trends.
The quarter also included the $105 million benefit from a previously announced change in the discount rate for
workers' compensation. This change was associated with a merger of our internal pooling arrangements effective
January 1.
Our expense ratio was essentially unchanged in the quarter as expected, and we continue to progress with our Japan
integration. Our investments in Japan and the benefits from the recent severance charges will emerge later in 2015.
Turning to slide 9, we saw growth across commercial product lines outside of Casualty. Global Property led growth and
net premiums written increased 12% adjusted for changes in our corporate cat program.
We saw new business growth in large limit and middle market business globally, particularly in Europe. And we
continue to leverage our in-house engineering capabilities and execute on our global approach to capital allocation. We
did see a more competitive market in U.S. cat this quarter, where there is overcapacity, and we were disciplined in our
renewals.
Commercial Insurance pricing remained positive during the quarter and largely exceeded loss cost trends, though rate
increases were slightly lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Global commercial rates increased 1.9% in the quarter. The U.S. market continued to lead in rate improvement with a
4.4% increase in the quarter. U.S. Property led with a 5.9% increase, followed by U.S. Financial Lines, which was up
4.2%. U.S. Casualty and U.S. Specialty each had 4.1% rate increases.
The accident year loss ratio in Commercial improved 0.3 points from the year ago to 65.1 points, even with the low
severe losses of a year ago, as a result of our pricing actions, enhanced risk selection, technical underwriting, and
investments in claims handling. Notable improvement in Casualty's accident year losses reflected the impact of rate
increases and continued improvements in business mix. Casualty has been a leading contributor to our declining loss
ratio and delivered a positive risk-adjusted profit this quarter.
We remain focused on retaining our most profitable business and refining our account quality scoring tools at an
increasingly granular level. Severe commercial losses accounted for a 2.9 point impact to Commercial's loss ratio this
quarter versus 1.2 points in the year-ago quarter and were within a reasonable range of expectations.
Turning to slide 10. Net premiums written for Consumer Insurance increased 2% excluding the effects of the yen
exchange rate. In Consumer, we continue to focus on improved underwriting quality and targeted growth in key
markets where we can achieve meaningful scale. As Kevin advances his strategy, you will hear more about our plans.
Similar to our learnings from our Commercial transformation, Consumer is being led to embrace transformation with
an emphasis on value creation. Consumer continues to remain on track for modest improvements in both growth and
profitability in 2014. The consumer accident year loss ratio increased 0.5 point from a year ago to 59.3 points,
including 1.2 points arising from three individual fire losses in North America Personal Property. These losses were
geographically dispersed and were predominantly older policies.
Our risk appetite and exposure to North American Personal Lines has been stable for some time. While large personal
property losses are difficult to predict, this was the first time we experienced three Personal Lines losses in excess of
$10 million each in a quarter or even in one year. In each of the prior two years, we experienced just one Personal
Lines loss of over $10 million.
Across the remaining Consumer business, we saw improved results in automobile, warranty, and A&H, driven by
underwriting actions and rate increases taken in the current and prior year.

Turning to slide 11, operating results reflected a modestly lower level of net investment income, which resulted
primarily from a lower invested asset base caused by the run-off of our reserve base, which has fallen from $68 billion
in 2010 to $63 billion today. As I mentioned earlier, alternative returns exceeded our expectations by over $100
million.
With respect to capital management, as planned, we did not remit a dividend to the holding company during the
quarter, but we did make tax payments of $188 million. We look forward to contributing our planned dividends during
the remainder of the year.
Turning to slide 12, Mortgage Guaranty's operating performance continues to improve with operating income for the
quarter of $76 million. Mortgage Guaranty continues to benefit from its proprietary risk selection model and an
improving housing market, with 62% of earned premiums generated by high-quality business written after 2008.
The delinquency ratio of 5.3% for the quarter continued to fall as the volume of new delinquencies is lower and cure
rates improved. The mortgage insurance market continues to evolve. As the highest rated and leading U.S. mortgage
insurer, United Guaranty is well positioned to remain a disciplined and competitive market participant.
In closing, we continue to advance our strategic initiatives, work collaboratively across AIG businesses, and further
build value for all our stakeholders.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jay to discuss Life and Retirement results.
Jay S. Wintrob
Thank you, Peter, and good morning to everyone. Beginning on slide 13, the first quarter of 2014 was another record
quarter for AIG's Life and Retirement business. The segment delivered over $1.4 billion of operating earnings,
achieving the highest level of quarterly earnings in our history. Operating income was driven by strong growth in fee
income and enhanced spread income. Higher account balances, due to strong sales and equity market appreciation,
generated increased fee income. Interest rate sensitive businesses continue to benefit from disciplined pricing on new
business, reduced renewal crediting rates, and runoff of older business crediting relatively high interest rates.
Our diversified portfolio of alternative investments, hedge funds and private equity, generated very strong returns
during the quarter, contributing approximately $260 million of investment income above our targeted 10% annual
return. Fair value accounting for our investment in PICC Group common stock resulted in a $110 million decline in net
investment income year-over-year.
In addition to strong earnings, Life and Retirement delivered $1.7 billion of dividends to the holding company in the
first quarter and we're on target to meet our dividend plan for 2014. We ended the quarter with shareholders equity
ex-AOCI of $34.6 billion, nearly $2 billion higher than a year ago.
Our all-products, all-channels distribution platform continued to produce strong results. Retail sales were up 61% from
the year ago period, reaching nearly $4.4 billion in the quarter. Sales of Retirement Income Solutions products,
including individual variable annuities and fixed index annuities, reached nearly $2.2 billion in the quarter, up 54%
from the year ago period.
Our guaranteed income options, effective marketing programs and materials, and award-winning customer service
continue to differentiate our offerings in the marketplace, while our innovative and competitive product design has
improved the risk profile of these products. We remain comfortable with our level of sales and continue to achieve
pricing IRRs in excess of our long-term targets.
Fixed annuity sales more than doubled from the year ago period to $960 million. Our cost-efficient flexible annuity
administration platform and deep, long-term relationships with financial institutions enable us to remain the number
one provider of fixed annuities through the bank channel, a position we've held for the past 18 years.

We saw a slight decline in fixed annuity sales on a sequential basis, reflecting our strategy of maintaining disciplined
pricing in response to declining interest rates, which occurred over the course of the quarter. At the end of the first
quarter, assets under management reached $324 billion, up 9% from a year ago, driven by strong retail investment
product net flows, higher separate account balances, and greater institutional assets.
Net inflows in our retail products and Group Retirement businesses were $1 billion in the quarter, up substantially from
a year ago. This improvement was driven by strong growth in sales in Retirement Income Solutions, Retail Mutual
Funds and Fixed Annuities as just discussed.
Our stable value wrap business accounted for a $13 billion increase in AUM from the year ago period, reflecting the
deepening and broadening of our client relationships in that business. Overall, we're pleased with the growth in assets
under management we're seeing across the portfolio of businesses.
Slide 14 provides the components of operating income for our Retail and Institutional businesses. Line of business
comparisons to the year ago quarter were adversely affected by the fair value accounting for PICC mentioned earlier.
Excluding this impact, Retail and Institutional operating income each increased by 10% versus the year ago quarter.
Retail operating income benefited from growth in fee income from Retirement Income Solutions and enhanced spread
income from Fixed Annuities. Institutional operating results were driven by increased contribution from Group
Retirement, from both higher fee income and enhanced spread income in that line of business.
Over the past four years, we've redesigned our products to reduce risk to AIG. In our Retirement Income Solutions
business, approximately three-quarters of our $25.3 billion of variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal
benefits, include benefits with strong de-risking features, such as the VIX indexing of our rider fees and volatility
control funds. In addition, we require minimum allocations to the fixed account, which also reduces risk.
While we see competitors increasing their presence in this market, consumer demand for variable annuities remains
very strong. We're also benefiting from growth in indexed annuities as a result of improved product features, a low
interest rate environment, and our strong bank distribution presence.
Slide 15 shows our trends in yields and spreads. Base yield in the quarter was 5.32%, up from 5.3% in the prior year
quarter, and up from 5.29% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase primarily reflects the contribution from
participation income on a commercial mortgage loan fail and redemption income on a preferred stockholding in the
quarter, which more than offset the impact of lower new money reinvestment rates.
We continue to actively manage crediting rates on our in-force block, and remain disciplined in our new business
pricing as demonstrated by the decline in the cost of funds for both our Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement
business. As a result, net spreads expanded for both Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement sequentially and from the
year ago period. At the end of the first quarter, 72% of our fixed annuity and universal life account values were at
minimum guaranteed crediting rates.
Slide 16 shows our investment portfolio composition and returns and reflects the benefit to net investment income of
strong alternative investment performance in the quarter as mentioned earlier.
So to sum up, we're off to a good start to the year with strong earnings and distributions to AIG. We plan to continue
executing on our strategic initiatives, which include growing our distribution organization and increasing the
productivity of our wholesalers, affiliated agents and financial advisers. We're successfully leveraging our strong
relationships with distribution partners to increase penetration of our broad retail product portfolio, build on our market
leading positions and offer competitive and profitable retirement income solutions. We also look to continue
opportunities to grow our Institutional businesses, where we can achieve the most attractive risk-adjusted returns.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Randy Binner with FBR.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Hey, good morning. Thank you. In the opening commentary, Bob said that the buyback in the
quarter was measured, and so I was wondering how to think about what we can expect for kind of a run rate there?
Should we think of this as [ph] somewhat weakened (26:25) run rate or could you let that go more going forward?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I think the word measured is not necessarily for the quarter, but generally speaking as
we go through this period of time. The Federal Reserve coming in and really working with us on being prepared for an
official CCAR down the road once it's defined by the Fed, that you want to make sure that you do things in a steady
hand and that's all that was referring to. So I think, as we look through the rest of the year, we have a capital plan. We'll
review that capital plan and update our stress testing as we do internally. Again, it's not the official total reserves stress
test, but as we update ourselves, we will keep an eye on that capital plan. Once ILFC actually closes and we have the
money in hand, we'll take a second look at it. So it's just doing things in a very measured way, close to the Federal
Reserve and, quite frankly, to the rating agencies. We want to make sure that we satisfy especially the coverage ratio
for them as they're asking us to do, and we're in constant dialogue with them. So that's all I meant.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Great. And then the follow-up would be, if you have any kind of updated comments on the
process with the Fed, and in particular, there's been recent introduction of bipartisan legislation in both the House and
the Senate looking to clarify the Fed's interpretation of Section 171 of Dodd-Frank. And so wondering if you have any
commentary on how that might affect the process?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I think what you see going on is an attempt to rationalize what's been Fed versus
insurance company versus banks. So I think that the Collins amendment and such is something that needs to be worked
through, so that we can – the Federal Reserve can clearly take a look at what we do here at the insurance companies.
And look, you all understand that our liabilities are very different and the way they behave is very different as we begin
to match the assets and liabilities. And our focus is really long-term solvency to make sure we live up to the promises
that we make to our clients and that's a big deal. And not to say that banks don't do that as well, but it's a different
business and a different structure. So I think that pretty much – I hope that covers more broadly. And I think we're
continuing to work with everybody to make sure that – not only in the U.S., but around the world, to make sure we're
adhering to and part of the design of appropriate regulation.
<Q - Randy Binner>: That's great. Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you. For Peter, the 97% underlying combined ratio, would you view that as a starting point
that the Property Casualty business can improve over the course of the year? I just wanted to clarify that first.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes. I do see improvement in the combined ratio during the course of the year based on our
forecast of normalized trend. So yes.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: All right. That's great. And then there appears to be a persistent drag on the reserving. I believe
we're in the fourth quarter in a row of persistent reserve strengthening. When do you feel that drag will be over?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: So we do a quarterly review of separate segments of the reserves that are in particular
subject to longer tails and harder to predict loss cost trends. And that's – each quarter is looked at independently of the
one before. So the cards fall where they fall based on new information that emerges and we do it with our internal

actuarial team as well as external review.
The fact that you've had four quarters in a row to me is statistically not very significant. And the numbers relative to the
total reserve of over $60 billion are relatively modest. The particular prior year development this quarter was from two
principal sources.
The international financial lines, which is a very profitable business we like, and so while there being some gradual
increase in tort temperature in a number of foreign jurisdictions, that's something which we gradually adjust our pricing
to, but we feel very comfortable with the return on risk of that business, and if anything, see that as exporting the need
for more insurance from the U.S. to other jurisdictions. So there's a sort of – some positive there.
The other piece relates to a large surety loss that occurred and it really came to us last year. So that's why it's prior year,
but it's a transaction that was underwritten about four years ago that involved a company that went into bankruptcy. So
I don't see it as indicative of reserve weakness. It's just a one-off event.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: How big was the surety loss?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: $89 million.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: $89 million. Okay. Peter, I think it is significant, from a comparison standpoint at least, we're just
not seeing this drag from other large P&C companies. For Dave Herzog, given all the $2.5 billion of cash up front from
ILFC, the $5 billion to $6 billion of dividends from the P&C business and substantial dividends also coming from the
Life company, I just want to get a sense of why AIG wouldn't accelerate the buyback, even taking into account that
we're in the course of coming up on a CCAR analysis?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Well, I think what Bob said is that captures the essence of how we are approaching capital
management. With respect to ILFC, as I said in my opening remarks and Bob said, we are going to go through a
process of actually close the transaction. We're going to update our stress tests that are – that – you could look at that as
sort of normal course, that's what we will be subject to at some point; although we're not today, we will be. So we're
following an orderly process with the Fed. We'll update those results. We'll review those results with the rating
agencies, with the Fed itself and with our board of directors. And so, again – and then we'll update our capital plan.
I think it's important to note that it's not appropriate to put in a capital plan, capital actions that are based upon
contingent funding. Others that have tried that did not like the result. So we've learned from that and we've learned
from others. So the capital plan will be updated in normal course, and then we'll review that updated capital plan again
with those various stakeholders and then take appropriate action. Again, I think our approach to capital management
has been consistent, steady, orderly, and those are dimensions that we believe are balancing the various stakeholders
including the Fed, including rating agencies, including our own management and board of directors. So we're moving
at an appropriate pace given the environment and given the on boarding of the Fed. So again, you saw what we did in
the first quarter and that is relative to what we did in the fourth quarter. And so I think we're comfortable with the pace
we're on.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Great. I hope at 80% of book, we view that as a compelling opportunity for buybacks. Thank you.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: And the answer is yes, we get that.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Thanks. Peter, I just wanted to ask a little bit about the North America commercial
business. It looks like the year-over-year improvement there slowed a bit in the first quarter, and given the written rate
gains that – or earnings through and movement towards what I would assume is a lower loss ratio property book, and
even taking into consideration the severity of losses that were effectively flat year-over-year, maybe trying to
understand what the margin – kind of whether we hit a speed bump or what happened in the first quarter or is there

something I'm missing there? Thanks.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I'm going to give that to John Doyle to answer.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Great. Hi, John.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Hi.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: What I would point out is that we continue to see underwriting improvement in our U.S.
Casualty business. As Peter mentioned, Casualty produced some risk adjusted profit for us in the first quarter for the
first time since we've been using that as our primary performance metric. And it was – more notable than that was that
our U.S. Casualty business was also RAP positive in the quarter, so we feel good about that.
Having said that, we saw some pressure on the top line in the first quarter. The cat property market got considerably
more competitive in the quarter so we stack priced some volume in the quarter there and in some cases walked from
some accounts. We also moved up some – on some programs to retain some relationships on some business that we
thought was within an appropriate margin.
And then in Casualty, there was some pressure on the top line. As Peter mentioned, ratable exposures on large
accounts, but also the result of some pressure from DBA business, which is a work comp-like cover for U.S.
contractors doing business largely in Iraq and Afghanistan, and with the wind down of a lot of the work there, we saw
some pressure there. We did see decent growth in the other segments, and continue to grow outside of cat property in
the United States.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Got it. So should we expect some kind of reversion of the – to what we saw in prior
quarters in terms of margin expansion there or how should we – we've just seen that a lot of the really big opportunity
to push for excess rate over loss trend might – the low hanging fruit might be behind us. Just trying to understand, just
given what we're seeing elsewhere, how should we think about margin expansion in the North America commercial
business from here just given that's really the management of margin improvement across the company?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Well, I'm not sure it ever feels like low-hanging fruit to me because there's lots of competitors
out in the market, but...
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Fair enough. Fair enough.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: And I would also mention to you that it's not just about price. Risk selection is an important
driver for our underwriting improvement, and we continue to refine our techniques and use a lot of the analytical
capabilities that were brought on to the team over the course of the last couple years to improve. But as Peter
mentioned, I pointed out cat property, but Peter mentioned in his prepared remarks, in most of the other lines of
business, rates continue to exceed loss cost trend. So and as he also mentioned, we do expect continued loss ratio
improvement when you normalize for the severe losses during the course of this year.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: Good morning and thank you. Hey, Peter, I think you, when talking about severe losses in
commercial lines, you said the $186 million was within a reasonable range. I'm wondering what the range is that you're
using today and should we expect that range to be increasing over time as it seems like you're continuing to emphasize
property over casualty in your growth plans?

<A - John Q. Doyle>: This is John. I'll jump in on that again. Severe losses for commercial were $145 million, just to
– the number you referenced included the three consumer losses that Peter referred to. It's within a range of reasonable
expectations. What I would say, it's slightly higher than what we'd expect, but it's going to be bumpy. Of course, we are
not going to see a quarter-to-quarter predictable number of these losses. One of the losses in fact came in on March 31,
right, so just as an indication. But – and if Property continues to grow as a percentage of the book, we'll see more
contribute from that line of business over time.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yeah, the most unusual aspect in terms of severe losses, as I mentioned, is in Consumer
where we had these three rather unusual fires. But in terms of the last few quarters, I was reassured by the fact that
most of the severe losses were from Property policies written some time ago. So it's not as a result of new exposure.
Yes, we are growing our Property business, but there is no evidence that is the cause of the elevated severe losses that
we had in the last three quarters. Over time, yes, as the book grows, it'll become a bit more lumpy, but no, I think it's
better diversified today than it's ever been before, diversifying away from U.S. cat to a more internationally balanced
global Property portfolio.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, also, can you provide us any visibility on the other
Property Casualty segment, which, no premiums, but throws off roughly 40% of your Property Casualty earnings? And
perhaps some sort of breakdown between what the run-off piece of that is, maybe the timeline for what that associated
tail is, and then how much of it is just purely investment income that doesn't get allocated to the Commercial and
Personal segments?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, the first is – I'll go work backwards. Your last comment is a substantial element in that
line item, which is the excess investment income. We use a transfer pricing mechanism between that other segment and
the Consumer/Commercial, which looks at the risk-free rate plus the liquidity premium, which is roughly 50 basis
points. So any investment returns over and above that is shown in that other segment and we've been fortunate the
Asset Management Group has done an excellent job of getting better returns than that. And so that shows up in that
segment. But we also have a number of run-off portfolios, excess workers' comp, some environmental policies, and
asbestos that's in that, which is going to be running off over several years, and ultimately will free up capital to be
redeployed in either dividends or growth in the rest of the business.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: So when the run-off is complete, do you still expect to have an other segment? I mean I
know we're talking years down the road probably.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think certainly not of that scale. And I think that perhaps an other segment might be
consolidated for all of AIG because we have a number of run-off assets at the holding company like the DIB and so on.
So I think that hopefully at some point, the total amount of run-off assets in the hold company are a footnote that
doesn't receive as much attention as they do today. But today, between those at the holding company and those that are
in P&C, it's still a fair amount of trapped capital, which ultimately will get redeployed productively.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: Thank you very much.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW Management.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Thanks. When we look at the International Commercial segment, I'm looking at last year, you
had sort of underlying loss ratios in the low 50%s in the first half of the year and low 60% range in the back half of the
year. Is there some sort of seasonality or does the sequential improvement from 4Q through the first quarter actually
represent something sustainable?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Just to make sure we -
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I didn't hear your question, was it – would you say Commercial or Consumer at the
beginning?

<Q - Meyer Shields>: I'm sorry, International Commercial.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yeah. The severe loss that John mentioned that came in at the very end of the quarter was an
international one and I think it's largely a severe loss that's shifting from domestic to international, but I think that the...
<A>: We explain it in the insert on page 17 the severe loss numbers for International Commercial and you can see the
growth there from the first two quarters of last year being very low to an elevated levels as we – for Q3, Q4, and the
first quarter this year.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. So we shouldn't expect the same sort of seasonality going forward?
<A>: No, I think we had very low in the first half of last year and elevated in the last three quarters.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. That's very helpful.
<A>: It's random.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Random.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Right. Unrelated question, how should we think about the process related expenses for
regulation, I guess I'm thinking AIG unique regulation in the insurance space, is that likely to increase or decrease from
what we're seeing currently?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I think that you've seen it baked in a little bit with our numbers. I mean we talk about
our expenses and when are they coming down. We, for example, have maybe close to 300 people dedicated full time to
working on our stress testing, could be as much as 1,000 people supporting them at the various points in time, reporting
the run rate for you and the numbers. We're already in the process of investing huge monies and technologies, which
we've been able to build a real strategic state-of-the-art system on the investment side and the asset side. We're now
putting a team together on building the liabilities and pulling them in in a very high-tech kind of way.
So that money is in the run rate, it's been in the run rate for, I would say, at least two and a half years. I mean, we
started off if you recall with Fed-ready; then it's welcome to the Fed and it's no longer Fed-ready, Fed's here; and we
needed to start really modernizing and putting a lot of money into infrastructure, which has been in the run rate for
quite a while.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yeah, I think the big investments are quite separate from regulations that related to merger
integration of AIU and Fuji Fire and Marine in Japan, that's a big spend this year.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. Fantastic. Thanks very much.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yeah. Couple questions. The first is that the G&A expense within P&C was quite a bit lower
than it had been running. It was lower in every single segment. Should we be reading into this improvement? And this
is the – just, not the ratio, but the aggregate number was down quite a bit from the fourth quarter. Should we read into
that?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: You could, but I don't think you would be interpreting it right. You've got to do the FX
adjustment because very sizeable yen expenses. So they look lower with the lower translation, but we are making
progress on expenses. But as I alluded to, we won't see the full benefit until 2015 as we work our way through the
merger integration costs in Japan. I have to say that we had slightly lighter project spend in Japan in the first quarter
than I had planned, and we'll see that come through in the second and third quarter despite the higher pace, but the full
year plan for spending in Japan is on track.

<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: What about the drop in the U.S.? I assume that – there's something to that? Again, fourth quarter
to first quarter, both in Commercial and Consumer, that overhead number came down quite a bit.
<A>: So, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we've had higher comp related expenses within both the U.S. and the
International businesses and that wasn't repeated in the first quarter of this year.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Got it. Second question, on ILFC, I fully understand how you're approaching this from a capital
management standpoint. You clearly don't want to put the cart before the horse. You have said in the past several things
on ILFC. One, you said that the sale of ILFC would be a credit positive event for the company, but that it was
transformational to some extent. You also suggest that the capital that unlocked, or that you received, when you sell
ILFC, in your view, should be free and clear, that it wasn't supporting any other businesses. Do you still stand by those
statements?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah. Hi, Jay. It's David. Yes, both, the short answer. Listen, getting – ILFC has total
liabilities about $25 billion, $26 billion, and that number sits today on our balance sheet in the liabilities held for sale.
There's no question that the rating agencies will see the actual closing of that sale as credit positive, they've as much as
said so. And the capital that – whether it's the shares of AerCap or the cash that we receive, that will sit at the holding
company unencumbered, not backing any other business or liability. And our judgment process will be as I set forth in
terms of how we're going to go about evaluating what we will do with those proceeds. Bob, I don't know if you want to
add anything?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I guess just keep in mind that I think the ILFC management team over the last four
years has done a Herculean job of turning around a business where we had not dealt with legacy aircraft as
appropriately as we should, did not have the right financing in terms of duration matching against purchasing of planes
and so on. So there's a huge amount of work went on in cleaning it up, building a really strong new airplane purchase
book. If you look at the planes, the NEO, we were right out in front of that and congratulations to the executives that
got that going, so the NEO 320. So we have a really strong order book. We've really done a wonderful job of cleaning
up our finances and dealing with older aircraft that needed to be sold or parted out and so on. So when you put the two
companies together, we view it as a very strong property.
And now we're getting some cash immediately, which is important. We do, as David said, have a lock up on it, but we
also see the future of this over the next several years as being extremely positive. And so we're going to make the right
economic decision for the company and our shareholders and over the next two or three years we'll see what's there and
make a decision based upon how AIG is trading, where we are vis-à-vis book value. We're expecting improvement in
our operating earnings as we go forward, improvement in our ROE as we go forward. So as that all comes together,
we'll have a better view of how we deal with this non-core asset, which we think has a lot of promise over more than a
one- or a one-and-a-half year kind of time horizon.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Great. Thanks for the answer.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yeah. Good morning. Two of them here. First, just on the Property Casualty insurance
interest and dividend income in the quarter, I know you said that part of the reason for the reduction was the lower
invested asset balance, but it was really a substantial decrease. Was there anything else unusual going on there, FX or
something would've impacted the decline from the fourth quarter?
<A>: There wasn't anything substantial. As we said, the alternative investments were – strongly performed, but our
overall interest and dividend – interest receipts were in line with our expectations.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Okay, because I was just looking, it's down like $80 million sequentially. Maybe there's an
allocation issue, kind of what you're talking about with the other that went into that?

<A>: Yeah. There's $15 million of PICC mark-to-market and then $60 odd million of other just declines in interest
returns – interest yields.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Okay. Great. And then my second question is for Pete or John. I'm just curious, the severe
loss activity that we're seeing, could any of that be attributed to some of the changes you've made in your reinsurance
program? And then kind of as an addendum to that, is there any way to kind of get a sense of what the benefit the
changes in the reinsurance program have had to your underlying combineds in the P&C area?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Well, our international net exposure, or non-U.S. net exposure did increase as a result of
changes in reinsurance. We continue to back test that decision to take more net and remain confident that it's been the
right economic decision for us. Last year, in the first quarter, we saw an unusually low level of severe losses, about $60
million in losses, and this year was close to a more normal rate. But I mean, as I mentioned before, as a percentage of
our total portfolio, our high limit property business globally is a bigger part of our Commercial insurance operation, so
we do expect, at least in the near term, those exposures to increase.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Josh Stirling with Stanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hey, good morning. So, love to start with a question for Kevin. So we've started to see some
improving Consumer margins, you've talked about your initiatives in auto, warranty and accident and health. And I was
wondering if you could – you've been here about six months and the company's Consumer business has started to
change about 18 months ago. I'm wondering if you can give us sort of a little bit of the story as to sort of how the focus
in Consumer is shifting and maybe some concrete examples of specific changes? And sort of specifically on things like
pricing and underwriting, I'm kind of curious, are you pulling these levers hard enough to get your business to – down
to the target of a low 90%s combined? Thank you.
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Okay. Well, thanks, Josh. As I mentioned last time, we are playing in consumer essentially a
similar playbook to what has been very successful in the Commercial side, really focusing on underwriting discipline.
We're using similar tools in terms of global raters, regular portfolio reviews, et cetera. And in the big portfolios of
Japan and of the U.S. in last two years, we've taken substantial actions, not only in terms of rate adequacy, but also
changing certain terms and conditions in the underwriting aspects of the portfolios. And as you mentioned, those
re-underwriting actions are starting to prove through, particularly in the automobile and the accident and health areas.
Outside of the two big portfolios in the U.S. and Japan, we're managing some important growth related initiatives in
some of the world's fastest-growing markets, the SPE portfolios. And from those areas, as we're using the appropriate
technical tools from the start, we're starting off with a standpoint of a sound technical base. There were a number of
challenges in the portfolios that we are re-underwriting our way through, including the accident and health business in
the United States, which is still a bit of a drag on our growth, but we are establishing a sustainable portfolio. And so I
would say we're partially through the re-underwriting process, but we have a sound base on which now to focus on
growth.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's great. No, thank you. Thank you, Kevin. So, a question for Peter and/or perhaps Charlie
around actuarial and reserving. So, you guys have been investing to drive an actuarial transformation along with
everything else you've been doing. And I'm wondering if you can give us a sense for what more you need to do to bring
your actuarial data and processes to be best in class? And then if we think about them sort of discretely, your reserves
in three buckets, sort of pre-2004 legacy, reserves from the financial crisis years, and then say the more recent business
that you guys have written yourselves since 2010 or 2011. For each of these three buckets, could you give us a sense of
your confidence level and sort of where you think the puts and takes and say strengths and weaknesses might be and
the current picks? Thank you.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Okay. Charlie, I'll leave that one to you.

<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: Josh, firstly on technology, I'd say before you get to technology, the key thing, and Peter
mentioned a bit of this in relation to the international financial line reserve strengthening, there's a lot of work that
we're doing to get very granular information with the claims department because we do see evidence of early settlement
of claims on a paid and an incurred basis, which is a good thing. We have much richer case reserve information than we
ever had before.
And so a lot of the actuarial methodologies are being adjusted for that, and so we believe our reserves reflect the best
estimates for that, but that – those cause us a lot of difficulties in looking at the historical patterns and the triangles,
because Eric's team is actively affecting those trends. And we think that will be beneficial to us in ultimate loss costs
eventually.
In terms of technology, we are, Bob mentioned it earlier, as part of the stress testing work and the capital management
work that we're doing, we are putting the liabilities onto fairly standard industrial strength platforms for income
segments and balance sheet predictions. And these are industry tools that help us not just look at point estimates, but
also uncertainties in those estimates and what drives those uncertainties.
In terms of the confidence in the three buckets that you mentioned, I believe we have confidence in every one of those
buckets. We set them to our best estimates regardless of which accident year we're looking at. If we see emergence now
that we had previously not expected, we will react to it in the quarter. One of the drivers in international financial lines
was in isolated buckets in Europe in our personal indemnity book, we saw a much longer tail than we have ever seen
before back through 2005, as early as 2005 in some cases, and we're reacting to that. So I wouldn't give you a
differentiated answer. The process we're following looks at everything every quarter and a very detailed dive into the
long tail classes. We have claims reviews and underwriting and also ERM involvement in the validation process at least
once annually for the long tailed lines.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's great too. So, and then so this quarter with the international financial it sounds like you
must have had some late [ph] emergence (59:43), sort of some latency you didn't expect and then the surety was
basically an individual claim that came through. It sounds like this is much more a case of you guys responding to the
data as opposed to say changing your approaches and sort of doing a study or something like that, [indiscernible]
(59:58) study?
<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: I think that's very fair. International financial lines is really isolated to two buckets. Peter
mentioned them earlier, but Australia and New Zealand in the excess layers and in CI and C&O specifically, and it's, I
would say, the frequency and the severity of the litigious environment in Australia in particular was higher than we had
previously built into our price. But as Peter said, that remains for us a very profitable portfolio. And then the European
CI book I mentioned, you know we had isolated pockets of individual countries in Europe where we saw much later
emergence for our claims main book.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Great. Well, thanks for taking the time.
