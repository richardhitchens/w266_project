Andrew N. Liveris
Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. If you look at slide 4, 2012 was a challenging
year. However, Dow controlled the controllable implementing strong and robust cost reduction and margin
improvement programs as well as reprioritization of growth projects and executed these tactical interventions with a
focus of a well-seasoned team.
Let me sum up the highlights from the fourth quarter and the full year, starting with the quarter. Here are the headlines.
Earnings per share excluding certain items was $0.33. Volumes stabilized as demand growth in Asia-Pacific and the
Americas offset ongoing demand weakness in Western Europe. Our stringent price volume margin focus enabled us to
deliver higher margins overall material costs with only a slight decline in price year-over-year and an increase
sequentially led by our strong Performance Plastics franchise.
Therefore, our results were adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, reflecting strong results in our Performance Plastics
franchise with a full 130 basis point increase in margins due to robust U.S. Feedstock and Energy fundamentals. I'll
have more to say on that in a moment. Dow Agricultural Sciences achieved record sales levels and EBITDA in the
fourth quarter. We saw significant decline in equity earnings this quarter, particularly from Dow Corning and our
ongoing headwinds in certain businesses, particularly, thermosets where we are addressing structural disadvantages,
were also seen in the quarter. However, and importantly, we continue to drive strong cash flow from operations,
delivering $1.6 billion during the quarter and more than $4 billion for the year as we had promised.
Turning to slide 5, this brings us to our achievements for 2012. Dow delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.90.
There were two key drivers. On the down side, price, which declined a staggering $2.1 billion for the year, with most of
the impact taking place from mid-year onwards. Note that currency accounted for nearly two-thirds of this decline. In
addition, as you know, the entire industry experienced significant naphtha-based margin contraction in both Europe and
Asia, and our equity earnings were down significantly for the year largely exacerbated by industry challenges specific
to Dow Corning.
On the upside, our strengthening feedstock advantage in the Americas, which includes Canada, Argentina and the
United States, along with healthy market fundamentals in Agricultural Sciences, partially offset these headwinds. In
fact, our Agricultural Sciences achieved record sales and EBITDA in the year of $6.4 billion and nearly $1 billion
respectively.
In addition, we reached significant milestones with critical enterprise growth projects such as our investments on the
U.S. Gulf Coast and our Sadara joint venture in the Middle East. These projects are game-changers to Dow's
bottom-line. More after Bill reviews the quarter. And as stated, we clearly sustained a laser-like focus on financial
fitness, reducing our debt by more than $600 million dollars, maintaining our liquidity position and achieving strong
cash flow from operations. Between 2011 and 2012, we generated $8 billion in cash flow from operations in line with
our previously stated targets.
This focus on financial flexibility enabled us to deliver on our commitment to increasingly reward shareholders with a
34% increase in dividends declared. And as we enter 2013, I am confident we have the right catalyst in place to deliver
on our earnings growth targets. I'll have more to say about this later in the call, and about our plans moving forward.
But first, let me turn it over to Bill for more detail on our financial and operating results.

Thank you, Andrew.
Turning to slide 7, Dow posted sales of $13.9 billion, a decrease of 1% versus the same quarter last year. Dow reported
a loss of $0.61 per share or earnings per share of $0.33 excluding certain items, which is up 32% versus the fourth
quarter of 2011. We had several certain items in the quarter; we recorded a charge of $0.57 per share associated with
the restructuring plan that we announced in October.
In addition, we took a goodwill impairment of $0.19 per share in our Formulated System business, reflecting a weaker
outlook in wind energy. We recorded a charge of $0.07 per share related to the recent restructuring actions announced
at Dow Corning. We recorded a charge of $0.06 per share for Sadara-related costs, and finally, we recorded a $0.05
charge related to the early redemption of long-term debt.
Now, let me turn to volume trends on slide 8. Overall, volume was flat as a decline in Western Europe offset volume
growth in both Asia-Pacific and the Americas. In fact, we saw a 7% volume increase in North America excluding the
impact of our Feedstock and Energy operating segment, which was down due to asset shutdowns in 2011 as well as the
expiration of sales contracts related to our polypropylene divestiture last year.
Now, let me turn to price trends on slide 9. Overall, prices declined $91 million, or 1% versus the fourth quarter of last
year. This modest decrease in price was more than offset by a $413 million decrease in purchased feedstock and energy
costs. Our focus on pricing continues as we head into 2013 particularly given the recent increases in propylene costs.
Turning to our operating performance, margins expanded as we largely held price in the midst of declining raw
material costs. This benefit was partially offset by a significant decline in equity earnings, largely driven by lower Dow
Corning earnings due to unfavorable solar industry conditions and oversupply of polysilicon. In response, Dow
Corning announced restructuring plan this quarter to mitigate the rapidly deteriorating market conditions. The cost
savings associated with these actions will ramp as we move through this year. The current unfavorable conditions in the
polysilicon segment are expected to continue for Dow Corning's Hemlock Semiconductor subsidiary. These conditions
could worsen if trade rulings on the importation of solar grade polysilicon into China are negative. If conditions
worsen, Dow Corning will take further actions as appropriate.
Now, turning to our operating segment starting with Electronic and Functional Materials on slide 11. We saw modest
revenue growth from Electronic Materials driven primarily by our semiconductor technologies, where higher foundry
utilization rates contribute to stronger demand year-over-year. In Functional Materials, revenue increased across all
geographic areas as volume gains outpaced price declines. Dow Wolff Cellulosics increased volume of strong growth
from new product launches in the food sector.
In Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions, Dow Corning – Dow Coating Materials, I'm sorry, grew revenue on
improving demand conditions, however lower pricing in epoxies hampered profitability. The segment also reflected
Dow Corning's lower equity earnings as previously mentioned.
Now, turning to slide 12. Agricultural Sciences reported record fourth quarter sales and EBITDA. Sales of new crop
protection products grew 11% for the quarter and 19% for the full year. Seeds, traits and oils also reported sales
increases driven by continued strong growth in both North America and Latin America. Strong farmer demand fueled
gains for unique technologies such as SmartStax corn hybrids.
Sales in Performance Materials declined due to lower volume and prices across most geographic regions. Polyurethane
sales were lower principally due to the shutdown of our TDI capacity in Brazil and lower prices particularly in Asia
drove sales declines in propylene oxide, propylene glycol and chlorinated organics.
Sales in Performance Plastics were up compared with the same quarter last year, driven by improved pricing in Europe
and Latin America and coupled with strong volume growth in North America.
In Feedstocks and Energy, the expiration of contract sales related to the divestiture of our Dow's polypropylene
business drove lower hydrocarbon sales. Higher caustic soda prices were more than offset by lower vinyl chloride
monomer sales driven by asset shutdown decisions in 2011.

Now, turning to our cost reduction and cash flow measures. As Andrew mentioned, we have accelerated our cost
reduction and cash flow measures. In 2013, reduced CapEx spending will result in incremental cash savings of $500
million. Prioritized growth investments and slower discretionary spending will deliver savings of $200 million and
restructuring plans we announced in 2012 will deliver incremental savings of $300 million. All together, we plan to
deliver $1.75 billion in cost and cash savings on a run rate basis by the end of 2014.
And finally, we will continue to actively manage our portfolio. In fact, we are targeting to divest up to $1 billion of
non-strategic businesses over the next 12 to 24 months. Now, looking forward, you can use the following assumptions
for modeling purposes. You can expect the savings from our announced cost and cash flow measures will ramp as we
move through this year. We expect Performance Plastics margins will remain strong in the Americas due to our
feedstock advantage.
Polypropylene costs are expected to increase $0.15 to $0.20 this quarter with some upside pressure. Dow Corning
equity earnings will remain depressed due to weakness in the polysilicon value chains specifically in the solar industry
and annual pension cost will increase $250 million to $300 million due to lower discount rates. You can expect a global
tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range.
And now, I'd like to turn it back over to Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris
Thank you, Bill.
I would now like to address Dow's earnings growth trajectory and the full array of catalysts we have in place to protect
that growth path. Our commitment to grow our earnings on this trajectory is unwavering and we have the team to
deliver this commitment. And during the year, we demonstrated this commitment by undertaking surgical aggressive
actions to accelerate near-term value growth. Let me show you how. Turn to slide 17.
In this current slow growth world, we recognize that we must adopt a more near-term pragmatic approach to funding
projects that preserve growth and simultaneously improve the return on capital all the while reducing risk. To be clear,
while we selectively prune, we will remain fully committed to funding efforts where Dow's differentiation is rewarded
regardless of the weak macro environment and where near and medium-term margin growth opportunities are clear and
well within reach and expand our leadership in key franchises.
Let me highlight some of those businesses and projects that are and will continue to demonstrate a higher operating
return on capital, businesses where our technologies and products are winning where we expect growth to continue and
where we are investing accordingly.
Turn to slide 18; our Electronics Materials portfolio is positioned in winning areas enabling faster processors, broader
displays and smaller internal components to match consumer trends.
Our Agricultural Sciences businesses is answering the call from farmers who are escalating demands for advanced
solutions to feed the growing population and seeking higher yields, and then of course there is our Performance Plastics
portfolio, an industry leading franchise that is generating high returns today even in the midst of trough like conditions
in Asia and Europe.
In 2012 alone, our Performance Packaging launched more than 40 new products showcasing its commitment to
innovation and rapid commercialization of new material solutions. When you couple the scale and location of our
assets, Performance Plastics is uniquely positioned to fully leverage the ethane cycle and deliver high margin attractive
growth for years to come. In fact, we estimate this portfolio would deliver EBITDA margins above 30%, an EBITDA
north of $5 billion in the upcoming peak.
If you turn to slide 19, and on that note, I want to share our view of the ethylene cycle. As you know in 2012, the
industry grappled with inter-negative margins for naphtha-based ethylene producers in Europe and in Asia. The
dichotomy of course is the Americas, which have shown exceptional margins strength as wet shale gas dynamics are

fundamentally changing the game for integrated North American based producers like Dow. This is clearly evidenced
by operating rates in the United States and Canada being in the 90s, while Asia and Europe have been in the 70s.
We reaffirm our view that even given modest GDP growth in North and Latin America, operating rates and margins in
the Americas will rise in the near-term. In fact, before the U.S. Gulf Coast capacity comes on line in the back half of
this decade, the Americas may well become a net importer of ethylene derivatives leading to a step change in price
necessary to attract to those imports. Further, as global demand outstrips supply in the next few years and world GDP
gains further traction, we anticipate operating rates higher than 90%, leading to a substantial margin expansion, a
double peak, so to speak.
On slide 20, Dow is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this change. For a start, ethane fundamentals were very
strong on the U.S. Gulf Coast as we move to the second half of 2012 and beyond. And we have long highlighted the
naphtha to ethane arbitrage that provides tremendous margin expansion opportunities for ethane-based producers like
Dow. But additionally, more recent industry dynamics further illuminate what differentiates Dow and that is the unique
advantage we gain from the powerful combination of current ethane as well as propane advantages on the U.S. Gulf
Coast and we are especially bullish on propane.
In fact, going forward, we see structurally long propane creating a ceiling on ethane pricing, and you can be sure Dow's
feedstock flexibility will allow us to continue to pivot so that we continue to take advantage of our uniquely advantaged
feedstock slate. And we are building on this advantage. Our actions in our investments particularly those investments
both here in the United States as well as in the Middle East are focused on dramatically growing this advantage.
So if you turn to slide 21, let me start with our U.S. Gulf Coast projects. Our St. Charles cracker restarted in December
hitting its end of 2012 milestone. This new capacity cuts in half Dow's U.S. Gulf Coast ethylene purchases. This is a
major year-over-year positive for us.
Our second ethane flexibility project in Louisiana, timed for 2015, also continues to move forward and will serve to
completely eliminate our in-region purchases. Just as critically, we are proactively positioning ourselves to benefit from
the aforementioned abundant propane supply and thereby mitigate exposure to volatile propylene prices that affect our
thermosets and coatings margins especially in the U.S. through our game-changing PDH project. This project remains
firmly on track and the investment is expected to add more than $450 million of EBITDA once complete and is a key
strategic step in improving margin performance and [ph] dampling (19:52) volatility in all of our propylene derivatives.
And these investments are not simply geared for margin improvements. They also enable medium-term growth in the
Americas as market conditions improve and industry operating rates rise, as evidenced by our plans to build a low-cost,
world-scale cracker in Freeport.
As we have often stated, this investment will remain true to our strategy to deliver advantaged feedstocks and volume
that matches the growth needs of our differentiated downstream derivatives. And as we have shared previously, we will
have partners for non-core ethylene derivatives for this project to achieve economies of scale. In fact, we're in the final
stages of structuring a significant strategic ethylene offtake agreement, one that is a win-win both for us as well as the
offtaker. We will announce this deal which will help with the capital cost of the new cracker very, very shortly.
In total, we expect our U.S. Gulf Coast investments and favorable wet shale gas dynamics to deliver $2 billion in
additional EBITDA by 2017. Of course, these projects bring low-cost feedstocks for the Americas and our huge
investment in Saudi Arabia named Sadara does the same for all of the key growth regions in the world.
Turning to slide 22, this joint venture with Saudi Aramco is very well positioned to serve Asia, Central and Eastern
Europe and of course the Middle East and Africa capturing customer demand and stimulating high margin growth for
decades to come.
I visited the site last month and I saw first-hand the significant progress our teams have made. We have achieved
several key project milestones. Front-end engineering and design work is complete. Product marketing agreements
have been signed and project financing remains well on track. We are on budget and on schedule and by next year, the
construction work force will peak at around 60,000 people all driving toward our target to bring the initial phase online

in 2015.
Taken on the whole, these are high return projects and will significantly strengthen Dow's near-term and mid-term
profitability. I mentioned earlier that we are managing our businesses with a laser-like focus on return on capital,
rigorously testing our portfolio to identify which businesses to grow, run for cash, fix, or sell.
Let me now turn to two segments where we are taking focused actions to address under-performance. Turn to slide 24.
I mentioned earlier our PDH investment which will enable Dow to benefit from abundant propane supply. Importantly,
this investment will bring less volatility and capture the benefit of what we believe is a sustainable structural change,
decoupling propane from propylene.
If you turn to slide 25, our Performance Materials and Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions segments consume
essentially all of Dow's propylene requirements and securing long term low cost feedstocks is a critical action to
improve the profitability of these segments. In fact we anticipate that the propylene from our on-purpose propylene
investment will enable us to drive margin expansion on the order of 300 basis points in Performance Materials and 150
basis points in Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions.
But this remedy we understand is medium term. And we have and will continue to take action in the near term. Actions
we have announced recently are squarely focused on improving the performance of these two segments today. By
shutting down high cost assets, strictly managing working capital, cancelling growth projects with backend loaded
MPVs and aggressively increasing price.
In addition as Bill has stated, in December we announced plans to divest $1 billion of non-core assets over the next 24
months. We are already moving forward on this target evidenced by today's divestment of the stabilizers component of
our plastics additives business. As well as the announcement made just last night regarding our plans to sell our 50%
ownership in Nippon Unicar Company, a joint venture in our Electrical and Telecommunications business.
As you think about our $1 billion divestment target moving forward, expect to see the actions centered squarely on
driving improved ROC.
Let me turn to slide 26, and before I move to our outlook and priorities, I want to cover one additional and critical
topic: Dow's commitment to strong cash flow and our focus clear priorities for uses of this cash.
As you know we have three and only three priorities for how we deploy cash; number one, paying down debt; two,
rewarding shareholders. Our 34% increase year-over-year in dividends declares and illustrates our Board's confidence
in our ability to deliver higher sustainable earnings growth over the long-term; and three, investing prudently in organic
growth opportunities.
Of course, the K-Dow arbitration awards will also serve to accelerate our priorities for uses of cash. As you know, the
$2.16 billion partial award announced last summer did not include interest and cost owed to Dow. Those significant
costs will be assessed in the final award. We are now simply awaiting the release of the final award to the parties,
which we expect to receive in February. This is an important last step in the arbitration. We have every expectation that
the two awards together will total nearly $2.5 billion.
As a reminder, we also have every confidence that interest will continue to accrue on the awards every day until
payment is received. And critically, this cash injection will go directly to our balance sheet, of this you can be assured.
As we've stated and taken on the whole, Dow enters 2013 squarely focused on driving earnings growth, increasing cash
flow and rewarding shareholders. If you turn to slide 28, our current business plans do not call for any macroeconomic
tailwinds in 2013 as we believe ongoing uncertainty in the global economy will continue to present challenges in what
we expect will be a slow growth environment. A repeat, of 2012 is what we are in fact planning for. We expect global
GDP will be near to 2.5% than to 2.0% and we do see decent improvement in the United States due to improving
fundamentals in key sectors such as housing, automotive and of course oil and gas.
The outlook in China is also growing brighter. Exports of the United States and elsewhere are regaining steam. The
output of significant local stimulation efforts have taken hold and the government is closely managing inflation

particularly of the property speculation variety. China should see solid 7% growth this year and other emerging regions
in general will continue their growth, albeit at slower rates than history.
The question is how will these positives be counterbalanced by continuing challenging conditions in Europe? We see
Europe as continually challenged certainly throughout 2013, and while the sum of all these uncertainties makes it tough
to read the year right now, Dow will continue to focus on its own course and benefit from the structural cost reductions
implemented in 2012, as well as our continued strong North American feedstock advantaged and the favorable
dynamics driving our Agricultural Sciences business.
Therefore, as we enter and navigate 2013, you could expect us to take actions on every front to deliver on our earnings
growth trajectory by, if you turn to our priorities, fully deploying the $2.5 billion of actions to reduce our cost structure
and generate more cash, the results of which are beginning to take hold. And by aggressively moving forward with our
key growth catalysts, which are: leveraging our feedstock advantage as the ethylene cycle unfolds, aggressively
commercializing our near-term technology pipeline and driving key investments for long term profitability in the U.S.
Gulf Coast and the Middle East.
All of these differentiate Dow. I will continue to propel our strategy to deliver high earnings growth and increasingly
reward our shareholders. The Dow team understands its priorities which are clear and we know what needs to be done.
We are fully accountable for proactively and aggressively implementing the tough decisions required to achieve our
short, medium and long-term targets and continue to accelerate value growth for our shareholders.
And with that, Doug, let's go to Q&A.
Doug May
Thank you, Andrew. Now we'll move to your questions. First however I'd like to remind you that my comments
regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply both to the prepared remarks and the
following Q&A.
Lisa would you mind going through and explain the Q&A procedure?
Q&A
Operator
Yes. Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.
[Operator Instructions] And we'll pause for a moment. Our first question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
<A - Doug May>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John McNulty>: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. So just the first one, with regard to the
Plastics business, you had some downtime last year. You have Lake Charles up now. I guess how should we be
thinking about potential downtime for this year? And what all this kind of added in means for volume growth in terms
of what you're expecting this quarter – or excuse me, this year?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, so John, it's obviously – this is Andrew – it's very hard to forecast unplanned and we
just had an unplanned in Texas. Our team did a great job of bringing that back up very quickly. But in terms of planned,
Bill will give you a specific sense of it, but look, nothing like last year, I mean, to answer your question. And that was
an unfortunately timed downtime as you know. So we lost a lot of the run-up in the low-cost feedstock side out of
Canada in particular. But we believe our Performance Plastics business is on its march up. We believe that the margin
expansions based on our steady-state model here shows operating rates going up. We believe that we're advantaged
specially in the growth regions with our Kuwait venture as well as our Argentina business and of course the U.S. and
Canada. So, I actually think that the business is doing incredibly well. They've got price increases out there. They've

got good operating rates and with the exception of unplanneds, I think you can expect year-on-year growth.
<Q - John McNulty>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Just to add to that, John, we're just – we're assuming just a typical turn around season
this year. And so, even in our turn around spending actually for 2013 will be very much in line with 2012.
<Q - John McNulty>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up question. In electronics, we've seen the
pricing continue to kind of drag down over the last few quarters and I guess if you can give us some colors to what's
really driving that and if there's competitive issues or it's commoditization type issues or if it's just weak demand?
Maybe you can shed a little light on that.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Definitely weak demand, John, nothing embedded in the business. In fact, the business has
got increasing investments and positive exposure to the growth side of the business which are tablets, smartphones,
OLED, solid-state drives, but the slowdown in PC and standard phones and the end of year – all the people you've seen
out there, whether it be Apple or anyone else, Samsung there's been some slowness in the consumer side this last
quarter and they expect it to continue into Q1, but no, nothing about the portfolio. The portfolio has positioned itself for
positive growth and positive margin expansion.

We'll take our next question from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Doug May>: Morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Andrew, I was wondering if I could ask maybe a broader question around your Performance
Materials business and propylene derivatives businesses. It seems like it's been quite some time since they performed
up to par. And I'm wondering if you can assess is this a Dow-specific issue, or is there something structurally about
those end markets and businesses that just make it a tough slog or how do you compare when you benchmark? And if it
weren't for just getting some low cost propylene production, is there a path to enrichment in other ways here?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, the fix – is it Dow-specific, I don't believe so. If you look at the two key parts of
Performance Materials that are underperforming and have for some time to respond to you point, epoxy and then the
whole polyurethanes chain including isocyanates.
The fixes are in place with the propylene back integration and the isocyanates investments in Saudi Arabia. So, low
cost competitive building blocks, propylene oxide, MDI, TDI, epichlorohydrin all those are in place for the two-year
route point.
In the short term what's been going on in the last couple years in particular, Bob, is the propylene volatility without half
of our exposure being on the purchase side of this thing. The propylene volatility mimics the old price naphtha
volatility and frankly the disconnect between the arbitrage of Asia where the markets are growing and North America
where the markets hadn't been growing the way our assets are, has particularly hurt polyurethanes.
Our epoxy – the Chinese just over built that plus the Taiwanese and the Koreans and it's over supplied and frankly we
took down the asset in Japan just recently. You saw us take down the TDI asset down in South America. Slide 25 really
speaks to the fact that in the very near term, in Performance Materials in particular, we have to intervene on high cost
assets in low growth jurisdictions.

Now the one in Japan is a clear one. The one in South America, less clear cause Latin America is growing. So how do
we actually bridge over to the low cost jurisdictions in developed markets and developing markets? It's the investment
in Saudi Arabia and the investment in the U.S. Gulf Coast that actually bridges us over.
In the meantime, you can expect price action and price action may result in loss volume, and loss volume may result in
some more assets coming down. We're going to put a laser-like focus because we are unsatisfied – dissatisfied with the
last two years of performance and it's creating headwinds that speak against the positive side of the Dow portfolio.
That's the ROC focus. We are determined to fix those two businesses and do it in the short order.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: And can you help us just size the reduced propylene sales to Braskem? Is this meaningful for
you from an earnings standpoint?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Not at all. Not at all. It was, not a great contract and we're okay to see it go.

And we'll take our next question from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.
<A - Doug May>: Good morning, Hassan.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Wanted to sort of chat a bit about the raw materials side of things. I mean obviously one of
the things that you've talked about is taking advantage of the low cost natural gas price regime here, ethane in
particular. One of the trends that seems to have popped up recently via a large sort of North American methanol
producer is that they've structured a long-term natural gas price contract. Now are you looking into such things as well?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, so Hassan, thank you for your question. So, we've long said that given our large
ethane buy in the United States we are – and Canada, we are the largest in North America, as well as one of the two
largest in the United States, that we have several weapons in our arsenal to deal with the synthetic buy, the equity deals
like the one announced by the methanol guy that you talked about or in fact just base contracts, and we predicted that
ethane would go long, and it went longer much faster than even we predicted. As one of my slides in the presentation
talked about, we believe ethane will go even longer. And as a consequence of that, we can afford to be patient and
structure the right deals.
The key for us is we are unusual in that we have full access. We have pipelines now to all the key basins, short of the
Conway, where everything else – Marcellus, all the ones down in Texas, the Eagle Ford et cetera. We have full access.
And every supplier wants to do a deal with us and we can be their anchor volume but we've been very prudent in not
anchoring too much of that volume in search of the better long-term deal and getting it struck at the right time. So,
yeah, that sort of deal, to answer your question, is not off the table but we're not going to strike too early until we're
ready.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Fair enough. Thanks so much. And a follow-up, if I may. On the chlor-alkali side of things,
obviously it seems that in Q4 the numbers were quite good but there's obviously some capacity coming online fairly
soon. So, what's your feel of the chlor-alkali market, at least in the near-term?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, I think caustic is steady. You saw the aluminum producers mentioning a 7% growth
rate in 2013. That's as macros start to recover in aerospace et cetera. So, price increases should start to take hold. The
weakness there in obviously the other side and PVC market is the softest since 2006. But there's increasing optimism
reflective of the housing rebound in the United States. So you could start to see an ECU cycle like we've had in the past
where both sides show good strength.
We're bringing on the Mitsui joint venture this year. That's a low-cost asset. We're taking down old assets. So net-net
it's the same, but it's a low-cost position. Mitsui is very excited about their U.S. Gulf Coast position. They believe they
can sell out their 50% share to market EDC worldwide. That's a very big statement on the low-cost position. And we
believe for our chlorine it'll go all through our downstreams and start to add, to Bob Koort's earlier question about
giving cost-advantaged chlorine to epichlorohydrin and our propylene oxide down there, which will start helping the

We'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. Andrew, want to ask about propylene. You've taken a lot of actions
in recent years to address the position there. Can you update us on what your current long-short position is in propylene
monomer and given the surge of $0.15 per pound in the U.S. in January, do you think you can get enough price through
in the Coatings and Performance Materials segment to kind of manage the margins there and restore them through
2013?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Let me get Bill into the mix here. Bill, why don't you take the question...?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, the second, maybe I'll have Andrew to touch on the first and the second part of it
in terms of the propylene increase. Right, as you know propylene has gone up about $0.15 in January and projected to
go up another $0.05 in February.
Just for an order of magnitude, that'll increase our propylene cost about – between $200 million and $250 million this
quarter. That's given us a lot of momentum on prices and so we are aggressively moving prices, but we're obviously
still early in the quarter to see if we can cover all of that. As you know our Performance businesses is a little bit of a
lag, but we do have a lot of pricing momentum and we're moving price. So, it's a bit early to call exactly how much of
that we'll cover this quarter, but again, it does give us upward momentum on prices.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: So, one of the points you're making there is about, can we actually get ahead of the
propylene gorilla as it goes through its volatility and what really hurts us and to answer the – one of the earlier
questions and the Performance Materials point as well as Coatings is that lead lag – when propylene's moving
quarter-to-quarter very hard to get permanent price increases out there. Neither the paint companies nor anyone
downstream in the industrial coatings area and the epoxy chain will take a price increase based on propylene going up
if propylene then goes down within three months. So that really is – what is really hurting our ability to get not just
inventory management, but even propylene-driven price increases to stick.
What helps all of that is improving demand and improving demand is what we'll see definitely in the Coatings chain.
I've seen the paints companies – the ones who've announced already – they're seeing good demand. They've also started
to talk about price increases in their part of the mix, their part of the chain.
Remember we're not PPG. We're not a paint company. We're not Sherwin-Williams. Sometimes there's a bad
comparison done between our results and their results. We're suppliers to them. We need them to be healthy and
growing; so they can get price increases, so we can get price increases.
At the moment, I feel, we feel positive about that on architectural coatings in particular. Epoxy will continue to be over
supplied and frankly there needs to be capacity taken out and we believe that we've done some of that and others will
do it as well.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Just a follow-up – second and final question for Bill, what is your capital expenditure
budget for 2013, please?
<A - William H. Weideman>: It's a $2 billion, that's down from $2.6 billion this year.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Last year.

Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna International.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning, Don.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Morning. Two questions.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Morning, Don.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: One, is just the impact of Dow Corning this year. As I look at Coatings and Infrastructure and
adjust for your write offs it looks like you've got over $180 million of equity income there. What's your outlook for this
year? How bad are things going to be at Dow Corning?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, let me answer that. So, just to give you a little bit of clarity on the change of
2012 versus 2011, our share of Dow Corning's equity earnings in 2011 was approximately $400 million. And our share
of Dow Corning's equity earnings in 2012, excluding certain items, was $179 million. So our share of Dow Corning
equity earnings declined $224 million. So, a little over 50% between 2011 and 2012 due to, as I mentioned in my
prepared comments, due to oversupply of polysilicon and then also weakening in the solar market. So, we have seen a
substantial decline there.
Now, as I mentioned in our prepared comments, Dow Corning has taken focused actions. And they announced two
restructuring programs in the fourth quarter. And so, they're very focused on hitting this head-on and maintaining their
profitability.
For the full year 2013 versus 2012, with these interventions and if we don't see any further decline in the market, we
believe for the full year 2013 versus 2012, their equity earnings will be similar in 2013 versus 2012, with maybe a little
bit of downward pressure. So, hopefully that answers your question.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thanks. And, Andrew, as a follow-up, just wanted to clarify your chlor-alkali remarks. So as
Freeport starts up in mid-year, you'll be taken down some of your older assets like Plaquemine. Will those be shut
down permanently? Or do you still need some chlorine out of those to meet your eventual growth needs in chlorine
derivatives?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. I did not make a statement on Plaquemine nor doing that in Plaquemine at all. I was
just talking more about lines in Freeport. So, we'll have more to say later this year about what we'll do around
Louisiana.

We'll take our next question from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments.
<Q - Peter Earle Butler>: Yeah. Good morning. Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, Peter.
<Q - Peter Earle Butler>: Andrew, it's nice to hear once again that we're not going to be allocating cash to M&A,
that's music to shareholders' ears. Could I ask – could you give some guidance on the other cash flow numbers? You
gave the CapEx, but what are you looking for in other items, sources and uses of funds this year and next?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Peter, thanks. I'll let Bill take that.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, Peter. So from an overall standpoint, we've already mentioned – so you
mentioned the CapEx will be coming down. We've also got off to a very much of a focus on working capital. And so,
we will be driving working capital down. If you think about our overall cash from operations, as you know, this year
we – our cash from operations was $4.1 billion. That was up from the prior year of $3.9 billion, despite the fact that we

had lower earnings.
So going forward in 2013, you should expect our cash from operations to be north of $4 billion, due to the interventions
that they were taking. So, and that's going to come from our working capital focus, our lower CapEx spending. Our
growth spending is, as I mentioned in my comments is coming down $100 million and also discretionary spending of
$200 million. So, we feel very confident with – we're going to generate strong cash flow in 2013 and that'll give us the
ability to continue to pay down debt, fund pension, and also reward shareholders.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: And Pete, I just want to ride the back of a couple of things said in the script, but they're
very important to you – the way you asked the question. So, not only no M&A, but also deployment of cash to the
balance sheet. So I mentioned the Kuwait funds to the balance sheet, a very important statement.
Second, Bill talked about divestments of $1 billion. We're accelerating those and to Bob Koort's earlier question, you
can expect to see more action in the Performance Materials portfolio as we drive further and increase price and look at
unutilized assets and businesses that are not performing, strong ROC focus, but our cash-driven ROC focus, we
understand that we have a huge upside on the Performance Plastics business and our Ag business.
So, lots of cash being generated there. We can really prune R&D spending away from the medium to long-term and
home in on those underperforming businesses and home in and fine tune the portfolio. So, expect deployment of cash
to balance sheet and reward shareholder. That's our single biggest priority this year.
<Q - Peter Earle Butler>: Sounds good. Could I ask on the Ag Chemicals, Andrew, how are the early order – the
early orders looking and what sort of growth does that support?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, right now that business, as you know, almost hit $1 billion of EBITDA last year and
had a record – and frankly record year – record year in sales and record year in profit and the order book is looking
very strong for farm solutions this year being launched, one of the highest in the industry.
We will do about 30% of the year's business in Q1 based on the order book right now, seed and crop protection in
advance of spring plantings in North America looks strong. Our Latin America was strong. Q4 looked strong, Q1 and
so; I would tell you that we're very, very bullish on our growth engine in Ag Chemicals and Ag Seeds, Traits and Oils.
Seeds, Traits and Oils is now a $1 billion business and actually is starting to begin to turn the corner on profitability.
It's reached critical mass; very excited about that.

We'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Hi, David.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Andrew, just on ethane, is this $0.25 per gallon price been a norm given long ethane and
long propane going forward?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. As you know, I'd be very loathed to pick a number, but pick a range. I mean,
obviously you've got rejection. On one side is the flow and then you've got the long supply that – we've showed it again
in my presentation today and have long talked about, and we've got all the fractionators, when they're coming on line,
what volumes they're going to bring and one would expect, David, and it's foolhardy to forecast, but we're going to
benefit from this 20-something number for a few years to come. If it goes into the 30s, it will be due to aberrations, but
we've always said, and back to Hassan's question, this is going to be a long ethane market for at least four or five years.
Back half of the decade will go short again as all the capacity comes on line and then at the tail end of the decade it will

go long again. And frankly, wet gas in the United States – wet shale gas is a game changer in terms of competitiveness
of U.S. based producers.
Dow has $25 billion of its asset base in the United States that will benefit from not just the ethane side but the propane
side. And the propane side puts a ceiling on the ethane side because there's no real good use of the propane other than
sending it overseas, which some of it will occur, but also propane dehydro and our propane dehydro will be a game
changer to fix our propylene derivatives. Two big powerful positives off that one dynamic.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And just lastly, Andrew, I know in the past from propylene – propylene has spiked here. It's
hurt your propylene derivative exports to Asia.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Is that occurring right now again?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: A little bit, but what we've done is deliberate decisions. Our businesses decided, that's why
their numbers in Asia were not so good in the fourth quarter. They've decided to keep it home because the returns are
higher at home. And then on top of that, they're raising prices because of the propylene point that was made earlier,
plus more decent market dynamics. As we turn the corner, Q4 to Q1, Coatings and Polyurethanes are seeing better U.S.
market dynamics. So price increases in those two businesses is the fix that was asked about earlier.
And sustained propylene, at these levels, doesn't bother us if it stays somewhat predictable. And that's of course one of
the issues that I dealt with earlier. But we are more confident on the macros than our, if you like, our macro planning
suggests, based on the evidence we see today especially in the U.S. in certain markets; and especially in China, which I
mentioned on TV this morning.

We'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi, good morning. Can you tell me your expected pension funding for fiscal – for 2013
and your cash restructuring outlays that you expect for 2013?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Sure, Jeff, this is Bill. So, for our cash outflows and for our restructuring consistent
with what we communicated when we filed our 8-K in the fourth quarter is about $430 million, is the future cash flows
associated with that.
And then on the pension funding, I mean, as you know with the Pension Relief Act, our required contributions on the
pension fund go down over the next couple of years, about an average of about $350 million to $375 million. But for
planning purposes, you should assume that we'll continue to fund the pension plan in 2013 at the same level we did in
2012, which is roughly $900 million.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay. And then secondly, on slide 19, you have domestic and global ethylene operating
rates. And for 2012, I think the chart shows an 88% global industry operating rate, with the U.S. being at 89%, but I
think in your commentary, you also said that you thought Asia and Europe were in the 70%s. So, I was wondering if
you can reconcile how the global rate can be so high in 2012 given the low rates in Asia and Europe.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, so the comments in the talk, thank you, Jeff, the fourth quarter was in the 70%s, not
the whole year. That's a short answer to your question. So, the average is what you see there on that slide. Fourth
quarter, the pitch point was very high and then it started to recover as the pitch point expanded – sorry, declined and
that was due to price increases in Europe, local price increases.

We'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
<A - Doug May>: Lisa, maybe time for one more question then? We'll make it P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yeah. Hi.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Hey, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: So, Andrew, you balance sheet remains leveraged, your net debt was up in 2012 and you
announced this $1 billion of divestiture, but it seems small relative to your size. So my question is, why not monetize
some of the joint ventures that are underperforming or even equate to clean up the balance sheet and pay off those
preferreds?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, of course, you're looking at the debt-to-total cap due to the pension adjustment of the
restructuring, where – you remember our historic range, P.J., is 35% to 45%. So, even with that massive pension
headwind, now that was a $2.2 billion swing in pension funded status, and other companies have got it and so we're not
alone, but clearly those are big numbers for us.
And to speak to your leverage, we've reduced debt by $600 million in last year. I think, I was very clear on one of the
other questions, and even on my prepared remarks. We are driven to take that number down, not because of the range
of being absolute anymore, 35% to 45%, but we think in this volatile macro world that we saw in full color in the
second half of this year, it's better to be closer to 35% than to 45%. So, we will continue to deploy excess cash to debt
pay down and of course retirement of the preferreds.
We are obviously very keen to get the preferreds off the balance sheet, but clearly they have to be priced, that price has
to eventually has to make sense and we will work on that. Your point on more divestments inclusive of what may or
may not happen in key joint ventures is definitely everything's on the table, P.J., to make sure we stay on our earnings
trajectory. Everything is on the table.
We will portfolio and manage inclusive of more divestments so that we always put in place the best on our mindset of
our businesses and continue to march on the earnings trajectory to $10 billion. So, I would say, anyway, to answer your
question, yes.
<A - Doug May>: Good.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you.
<A - Doug May>: Oh, go ahead. One follow-up, P.J.?
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yeah. So, I just have a quick question on your commodity footprint in Europe and what can you
do there particularly with your cracker in Tarragona, Spain? Thank you.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, Tarragona is, as you quite rightly point, the only full-fledged naphtha cracker that
doesn't have flexibility. Our business is working on making that more competitive and decreasing the commodity
footprint. I think no question that Europe, as I've already indicated in my remarks, needs more rationalization, more
margin improvement, more restructuring as time goes by, but we'll manage that within our portfolio of management
process. So, we don't have any big pay or big shoes to drop there P.J. We know what we have to do including the point
you made on Tarragona.
<A - Doug May>: Good, thank you. Andrew, would you like to maybe close with a few comments.

Yeah, I think P.J.'s questions were right on what I was going to say at the end, which is, look, I think we are seeing a
different type of market as the year ended. I think our portfolio and the cost restructuring that we put in place, we can
count on those in 2013 as extra EBITDA. Dow's known for its operational excellence and its execution.
We will intervene as if the market isn't going to recover, but if the market does recover we have tailwinds that will help
us a lot and we're seeing some of those as we turn the corner on the year, especially in the United States and especially
in Asia and the emerging world.
In fact, our price increases and our volume increases in some key businesses like the ones in Performance Materials and
Performance Plastics are an actual margin enhancer as we go into the year. We lost $2 billion in price off the top line in
the second half of last year and we have the Dow Corning weakness. Those are two big weights on the earnings last
year that we've acted to fix and we're going to benefit from the cycle upswing and investments in feedstocks especially
here in the United States and Saudi Arabia.
So, I believe that the company is very focused on execution and will deliver against its earnings targets. Thank you,
Doug.
