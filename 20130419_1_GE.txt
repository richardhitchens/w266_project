In the first quarter, our market conditions proved to be volatile. Most of our emerging markets, including China,
remained strong. However, the U.S. indicators were mixed. While housing improved, some of our shorter cycle energy
segments experienced push-outs from March. We planned for Europe to be similar to 2012, down again, but it was
even weaker than we had expected. And finally, we had an FX headwind in our Oil & Gas business.
Based on this backdrop, our results were mixed. Our EPS was $0.39, up 15%. This was actually $0.35 because not all
of the NBCU gain was offset by restructuring in the quarter.
Leading indicators in our longer cycle infrastructure businesses were encouraging, with orders up 3%, which was 6%
ex-Wind. Equipment orders were up 10%, and we had a 1.3 times book-to-bill ratio in the quarter. So this gives us
confidence in our delivery schedule for the second half and beyond.
Power & Water was a drag on our overall results. Wind and thermal units were down in the first quarter, but that was
expected. We experienced incremental pressure in European services. And based on our current backlog, however, we
expect shipments to significantly improve in the second half. And we'll show you a detailed chart with the financial
profile for the remainder of the year. Finally GE Capital delivered a solid quarter, up 9%, while they continue to shrink
their non-core assets, which were down $17 billion in the quarter versus previous years.
We remain focused on our operating priorities. We were able to accelerate restructuring actions and we've taken out
$200 million of structural SG&A cost in the first quarter, well on our way to at least a $1 billion reduction in 2013.
Margins were negatively impacted by some of the revenue shortfalls in Europe in Power & Water, but we remain on
track to deliver the 70 basis points margin expansion this year, and we'll show you more details later in the deck.
We finished the quarter with $90 billion of consolidated cash and $22 billion of cash at the parent level. We returned
$3.9 billion of cash to investors in the first quarter, including $2 billion of dividends and $1.9 billion of share buyback.
We announced the intent to purchase Lufkin, a $3 billion bolt-on acquisition which broadens our artificial lift portfolio
in Oil & Gas. For perspective, GE's artificial lift business grew by 12% in the quarter. We expect to close this
transaction and the previously announced Avio deal in the second half of this year. And both deals will be accretive to
Industrial earnings in 2014.
So in summary, our Industrial segment profits were about $200 million below our expectations. And that really was a
function of Europe, which worsened during the quarter, and some short-cycle push-outs from March into the second
quarter. Now we were able to offset that gap by doing a good job on corporate cost and slightly better GE Capital
performance, so that's really a summary of the first quarter.
Overall orders were a good story, up 3% overall and 6% ex-Wind. Equipment orders grew by 10%. Oil & Gas and
Aviation were particularly strong, and Power & Water ex-Wind grew by 10%. We ended the quarter with $216 billion
in backlog, which is a record for GE. Orders pricing was up 0.6 points, in line with expectations.
Many growth markets were strong. China was up 67%. Latin America was up 44%. Middle East and Northern Africa
were up 22%, and sub-Saharan Africa were up 41%.
Service orders were mixed. Our investors closely track commercial aviation spares, and they grew by 10% in the
quarter. That's good news. And while Power & Water service orders declined, commitments increased, which help
future periods. So the orders momentum in equipment and backlog expansion I think positions us well for the second
half.
Revenue overall was challenged. We knew the first quarter was going to be tough. Overall, our organic growth was
down six points, but that really was a function of Power & Water. Organic growth was up two points excluding that
segment, which was going through a tough cycle. Our revenue grew by more than 10% in five of nine growth regions,
including Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey; sub-Saharan Africa, New Zealand, ASEAN, and China. We continue
to see strength in many regions and believe that growth markets will stay on track for the year.

We grew backlog in service and margins in Services. Europe was a drag on service revenue overall, knocking five
points off our growth. But meanwhile, our Oil & Gas service revenue was up 10%.
Our investments in R&D continue to pay off. We were selected by Boeing as sole source for the next-generation 777.
We're launching the world's most energy-efficient wind turbine. Our leadership in locomotive technology is at the
forefront of potential LNG conversions. We continue to focus on new NPIs [New Product Introductions] in Healthcare
and Appliances. And we have a solid pipeline of advanced gas path upgrades worth about $500 million, which should
help Power Gen services in the balance of the year.
The biggest driver of Industrial segment profit is the Power & Water shipment profile that we've mentioned to you
before. In the first quarter, their operating profit was down 39%, driven by significantly lower gas turbine, wind
turbine, and aero derivative unit shipments. In Europe, the service business was down about 22%, and was the primary
cause of total service revenues being down. Despite their lower volume, the team delivered 70 basis points of services
margin improvement. And overall, the team did a nice job in reducing costs, but the volume decline was far greater,
pressuring their margin rates.
We expect their second quarter unit shipment volume to improve slightly, but it will still be negative versus last year.
And Services should be positive and continue to grow margin rates in the quarter and throughout the year. The second
half volume is supported by our $9.5 billion equipment backlog and will be up significantly in both Wind and Aero
from the first half. Services will also be up in the second half and we have better comps versus Europe. The higher
volume leverage coupled with Service margin growth will drive an improved margin rate. In addition, Steve and the
team are working to deliver $250 million of structural cost improvements throughout the year. So these efforts should
deliver a flat margin rate for the total year.
On total margins, the Industrial margin rate was 12.9% for the quarter, down about 80 basis points, but up 40 basis
points excluding the Power & Water cycle. We saw solid improvement in four of our businesses, driven by strong
value gap and cost execution. Oil & Gas was negatively impacted by foreign exchange, but some of that will come
back during the year. And we're planning on four businesses being above 70 basis points improvement overall.
If you look at the first quarter and total year dynamics, you'll see that we don't expect any significant impact from mix.
And the R&D drag from the first quarter is mostly timing in Aviation and Oil & Gas and will be neutral by the end of
the year. The value gap was strong in the first quarter, and we anticipate it continuing to strengthen throughout the year.
And the biggest negative in the quarter was the volume leverage from Power & Water. And as I said, it will be a
tailwind in the second half of the year.
As I've said before, we went into the year with a plan that would deliver more than 70 basis points of margin
expansion. Given the first quarter dynamics and the short-cycle energy related volume pressure, we've eaten into that
hedge, but we still have an internal plan for 90 basis points of improvement, more than the 70 basis points that we've
told all of you about. And that improvement is going to be driven by a change in Power & Water shipment profile,
Services margin growth, and accelerated cost-out programs. And in many ways, our margin progression fits the pattern
of previous years.
Cash in the quarter was impacted about $1.5 billion by shipment timing and a couple unusual items. We grew working
capital by $800 million to support Power & Water and commercial engine shipments later in the year. In addition, we
had an impact of about $800 million in incentive and tax payout timing. Not included in the number and not in the
number is a capital dividend of about $450 million, which will be realized in second quarter CFOA.
The company has a very strong cash position, with $90 billion in consolidated cash and $22 billion at the parent. And
we have no change in our overall CFOA framework for the year. We remain committed to returning $18 billion to
investors in 2013 through dividends and buybacks.
So now let me turn it over to Keith and he'll give you more details about the segments.

All right, thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the first quarter summary.
We had continuing operations revenues of $35 billion, and that was flat with last year. Industrial sales of $22.3 billion
are down 6%, driven by Power & Water, as you can see on the right side. GE Capital revenues of $11.5 billion were up
2%. And both the total and the Capital revenues include the benefit of the NBCU gain.
Operating earnings of $4.1 billion were up 14%. Operating earnings per share of $0.39 were up 15%. And if you adjust
for the net benefit of $0.04 from the gain exceeding restructuring, the operating EPS would have been $0.35, and I'll
cover that on the next page. Continuing EPS includes the impact of our non-operating pension. And net earnings per
share include the impact of discontinued operations, which I'm also going to cover on the next page.
As Jeff covered, CFOA was $200 million, driven by the working capital investments, incentive payments, and tax
timing. For taxes, the GE rate of 20% for the quarter is in line with the rate of about 20% that we expect for GE for the
year, but there could be some variability from quarter to quarter. And on GE Capital, the tax rate was 4%. And that rate
is down because in the fiscal cliff resolution, the active financing exception was retroactively extended, which gave us
a benefit in the first quarter. Because of expected additional asset reduction opportunities, we currently expect to see a
mid-single-digit GE Capital rate rather than the 10% rate we previously forecast.
On the right side of the page, you can see the segment results. Total Industrial segment profit was down 11%. That was
driven by Power & Water, as you can see. Segment profit for the other Industrial businesses was up 6%. And we expect
Power & Water, Oil & Gas, Energy Management to all improve as the year progresses, and I'll cover each of the
segments in more detail.
Before I go through the business results, I'm going to take you through the other items from the first quarter. Starting
with Industrial, as you know, we realized a $1.1 billion pre-tax gain related to the NBCU transaction, and that resulted
in an $0.08 after-tax EPS benefit.
The Industrial NBCU gain was partially offset by $0.04 of restructuring and other items in the quarter. The charges
related primarily to our cost structure improvements and our ongoing simplification actions across the company. And
the amounts by business are: Power & Water, $94 million; Energy Management, $60 million; Healthcare, $48 million;
Aviation, $46 million; Oil & Gas, $42 million; H&BS, $38 million; and Corporate, $46 million.
On the bottom of the page, you'll see the restructuring plan for the rest of the year. We're planning to offset the
additional $0.04 related to the NBCU gain with $0.02 of restructuring in the second quarter and $0.01 each in the third
and fourth quarter based on the timing of the restructuring actions being completed and approved.
Moving to GE Capital, we had $0.05 of benefit related to the sale of the 30 Rock real estate assets, and those gains
were offset in two categories. First, we had $0.02 of charges related to the platform exits and restructuring actions. In
the Real Estate business, we had an after-tax charge of $123 million that related to our planned exit of another $2.3
billion of equity assets. In addition, we had $53 million of charges related to cost reductions and non-core asset exits in
the rest of GE Capital.
The second category is we had $0.03 related to Consumer reserves. In the first quarter, we finalized our updates to our
reserve models in the U.S. Retail business for a more granular segmentation of loss types. We've been working on that
all year last year. In the quarter, this included completion of the analysis on bankruptcy, which for us is one of the
larger categories of losses. And the $0.03 also includes the impact for our Consumer portfolios in Europe and Asia and
also our current assessment of forecasted charge-offs across the entire portfolio. So these adjustments are aligned with
regulatory guidance and industry standards, and we believe we've completed the methodology adjustments in our
Consumer franchise.
On discontinued operations at the bottom of the page, we had a $109 million after-tax impact in the quarter. On WMC,
we added $107 million to reserves in the quarter, as pending claims increased from $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion. We
ended the quarter with $740 million in reserves, covering both the pending and the future claims. And our gray zones
claims were up in the first quarter above our model assumptions, so we booked $50 million of additional reserves, and
we ended the quarter with $561 million of reserves. In total, the operating impact from the other items netted to a $0.04

benefit for the quarter, and that will be offset through the balance of the year through restructuring, as I said.
So let me move on to businesses. I'll start with Power & Water. We were planning for a tough first half based on the
volume comparisons for Wind and Thermal, but the market was even tougher than we expected. Orders of $5.2 billion
were down 13%. Equipment orders of $2.6 billion were down 6%, and that's driven by Wind. Renewable orders at $1.1
billion were down 27%. Our Thermal orders of $759 million were up 10%. And our Distributed Power orders of $563
million were up 22%. So one of the highlights here in the quarter is that excluding Wind, our equipment orders in
Power & Water were up 16%.
Service orders of $2.5 billion were down 19%. That's driven by tough comparisons as well as order push-outs. In the
quarter, we had about $100 million of orders on several gas turbine upgrade projects, mostly in the U.S., that slipped
out of the quarter. And overall orders pricing for the business was flat in the first quarter.
Revenues of $4.8 billion were down 26%. Jeff showed you the unit comparisons for the first quarter which drove the
decline. Equipment revenue was down 42%. Service revenues were down 9%. And segment profit of $719 million was
down 39%, driven by the lower volume. We reduced our SG&A by 14%, but it wasn't enough given the unit declines.
And margins were down 3.2 points.
As we got to the end of the quarter, we had challenges in the market. As I mentioned, we had about $100 million of gas
turbine upgrade packages that slipped out of the quarter. We also had two distributed energy projects for a little over
$100 million that were delayed and pushed into the second half. And in addition, we had expected a stronger European
Power & Water service market, and that was down 22% on lower gas turbine utilization. So all these items would have
been in revenues and, of course, would have had a significant impact on both margin dollars and rate.
On the right side is Oil & Gas. Orders of $4.8 billion were up 11%. Equipment orders of $2.9 billion were up 24%,
driven by strong turbo machinery, strong drilling and surface orders for upstream production. Service orders of $1.9
billion were down 5%, driven by lower drilling and surface orders related to lower activity in North America. Our
backlog grew by $2.2 billion in the first quarter to $17 billion. And orders pricing across the business was up 1.5%, our
eighth quarter of order price increases.
Revenue of $3.4 billion was flat. Equipment revenue of $1.7 billion was down 4%, as our growth in drilling and surface
was more than offset by declines in turbo machinery. And service revenues of $1.7 billion were up 4%. That was
driven by stronger global spare parts sales, partially offset by lower Measurement & Control short-cycle volume. M&C
was lower as we saw customers delay investment decisions in the portfolio. And that impacted our expected revenues
in both equipment and service by about $125 million.
Segment profit of $325 million was down 4%, as the benefits of service growth were partially offset by higher program
spending. And the one unusual item in the quarter here was we had $34 million of negative foreign exchange related to
the weakening of the British pound. This is on an economic hedge over a long-term contract in the business, and we
will recover as we deliver the project. That hedge will go back to zero as we deliver the units over the next 12 to 18
months. Excluding the FX impact, segment profit would have been up about 6%.
Next is Aviation. The Aviation team had another strong quarter. Orders of $6.6 billion were up 22%. Equipment orders
of $3.8 billion were up 47%. Commercial engine orders of $3 billion were up 90%, driven by $1.4 billion of LEAP
orders and $875 million of GE90 orders. Military equipment orders of $300 million were down 42%. Service orders of
$2.8 billion were down 2%. Commercial service orders of $2.2 billion were up 8%. And our first quarter average daily
spares order rate was $25.3 million per day, up 10%. Military spares were down 44% on tough prior-year comparisons.
And overall business order pricing was up 2.1%
Revenue of $5.1 billion was up 4%, driven by equipment, which was up 8%. We shipped 596 commercial engines in
the quarter. That was up 13 units or 2%. And we shipped 279 military engines, which were up 44 units or 19%. Service
revenues of $2.5 billion were flat, as our commercial spare parts shipments were flat in the quarter.
Segment profit of $936 million was up 9%, as the benefits of a positive value gap and lower SG&A costs more than
offset higher R&D and the impact of 28 more GEnx engine shipments. And margin rates grew 80 basis points in the

quarter.
On the right side is Healthcare. Orders of $4.3 billion were down 2%. Equipment orders of $2.3 billion were down 3%.
For equipment, in the developed markets it was down 5%, and it's the same story we've had last year. The U.S. was flat.
Europe was down 9%, a little worse. And Japan was down 26%, 16% excluding FX, so soft. Developing markets were
up 4%, driven by China up 16%, Latin America up 4%, India down 7%, and the Middle East down 19%. By modality,
MR was flat. CT was down 5%. Ultrasound was up 7%. Life Sciences was flat. And Diagnostic Guidance Systems,
which is X-ray plus interventional, DGS was down 10%. Service orders of $2 billion were down 1%.
Revenue of $4.3 billion was flat, driven by the growth markets up 10% offset by the developed markets down 4%. And
segment profit of $595 million was up 2%, as the benefits of restructuring more than offset the impact of lower pricing
and foreign exchange, and margin rates here were up 30 basis points.
Up next is Transportation. The Transportation team delivered another solid quarter. Orders of $1.2 billion were down
26%. Equipment orders of $413 million were down 59%, as locomotive orders were down 70%, driven somewhat by
tough comparisons and also the net impact of the slowing coal market on the rail industry. Service orders of $746
million were up 31%, driven by strong signaling, and orders pricing was up 10 basis points for the business.
Revenues of $1.4 billion were up 12%. Our equipment revenue was up 3%, as the impact of lower locomotive
shipments, 143 this year versus 159 last year, was more than offset with higher mining volumes, somewhat driven by
the acquisitions.
Service revenues were up 24%, driven by higher long-term contract revenues in Mining Services. And segment profit
of $267 million was up 15%, driven by the positive value gap and services growth, and margins increased 50 basis
points.
For Energy Management, orders of $2.2 were up 6%, driven by Power Conversion, which was up 8%. And Digital
Energy was up 11%. Revenues of $1.7 billion were up 2%, driven again by Power Conversion, up 11%; partially offset
by lower revenues in Intelligent Platforms, which was down 15%. And segment profit of $15 million was down 29%.
That's only $6 million, but that was driven by $15 million of higher expenses in Asia and Brazil for expanding
capabilities to deliver the global $2.5 billion backlog that has grown over 25% in the past year. So segment margins
were down 30 basis points, driven by those investments. And we expect this business to grow segment profit and
margins through the rest of the year.
Home & Business Solutions had another positive quarter. Revenues of $1.9 billion were flat, as we saw 3% growth in
appliances, partially offset by a 5% decline in lighting sales. And segment profit of $79 million was up 39%, driven by
the positive pricing and a little lower program spend. And margins were up 1.1 points for the quarter.
And next is GE Capital. Mike Neal and the team delivered another solid result in Q1. Revenues of $11.5 billion were
up 2%. If you exclude the impact of the 30 Rock gain, revenues were down 6%, in line with lower assets. As I covered
on the earlier page, the impact of the 30 Rock gain was offset by the restructuring and the reserve increases, and I'll
cover those by business. And net income of $1.9 billion was up 9%, as we more than offset the impact of lower earning
assets with core growth and the AFE tax benefit.
We ended the quarter with $402 billion of ending net investment, which was down $32 billion from last year and $15
billion from year end, and our net interest margin was 5%. And our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio improved 65 basis
points to a little over 11%.
On the right side of the page, you can see our asset quality continues to improve. Delinquencies were flat or lower
across the board. Our non-earning assets were down year over year and from year end. And our liquidity remains very
strong, $68 billion of cash. And we ended the quarter with less than $40 billion of commercial paper. That's the first
time in 21 years that we've been under $40 billion, so a substantial change in the money profile of this business.
By business, the commercial lending and leasing business ended Q1 with assets of $176 billion, down 7% from last
year, driven primarily by non-core shrinkage, including $7 billion lower Penske, lower trailer leasing, lower SeaCo
assets. Net income of $398 million was down 40%, driven by the Americas. In the Americas, net income of $267

million was down 51%, and that's driven by lower assets as well as a $166 million after-tax impairment charge on one
investment in the quarter.
CLL volume was good in the quarter, up 8%. New business returns remained strong at about a 2% ROI. And asset
quality remained strong, with flat delinquencies and lower non-earnings.
Our Consumer business ended Q1 with assets of $137 billion. That was up 1%. Net income of $523 million was down
37%, driven by the finalization of the portfolio segmentation that I covered earlier. U.S. Retail Finance earned $382
million, which was down $259 million, driven by the reserve increase.
Excluding the reserves increase, the business was about flat in the quarter. Asset quality in this business continues to be
very strong. Our 30-day delinquencies of 4.2% are at the lowest level we've seen in ten years that we've been reporting
on this basis. And U.S. retail volume was up 6% in the quarter versus last year, and core Europe earned $145 million in
the quarter.
For Real Estate, the team had another great quarter. Assets of $43 billion were down 28% from last year. They were
down $3.5 billion from year end. Net income of $690 million was up more than $630 million from last year, again
driven by the gain on 30 Rock. If you exclude the gain and the charge for the equity exits that I covered earlier, Real
Estate earned $261 million, and that was up over $200 million from last year, driven by higher tax benefits, lower
losses and marks, and higher gains.
In the quarter, not including 30 Rock, we sold 52 properties for $1.3 billion and $121 million of after-tax gains. And
30-day delinquencies at 2.16% are the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2008.
For the verticals, both GECAS and Energy Financial Services had strong quarters in the first quarter. GECAS earned
$348 million of net income. That was up 9%. Earnings were driven by lower impairments and higher operating income.
And EFS net income of $83 million was up 17%, driven by higher gains.
So overall, GE Capital delivered another strong result in the quarter. And as you look forward to Q2, we'll continue to
have the loss of earnings from shrinking assets ahead of schedule. And if you adjust for the one-time items that I
covered, a normalized run rate for GE Capital the first quarter was about $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion. In Q2, we'll also
have the preferred dividend payment for the first half of 2013, and that is covered in our corporate line and our
operating framework that Jeff is going to cover in a minute.
So with that, let me turn it back to Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Great, Keith. Thanks.
Just again on the 2013 framework, we have no change to the overall operating framework for the year. And by that, I
mean specifically we expect our EPS to grow in line with previous commitments. The mix will change. We believe it's
going to be hard for our Power & Water business earnings in 2013 to equal 2012, which we've talked about previously,
primarily due to the incremental weakness that we're seeing in Power Gen in Europe and Services. As a result, our
industrial earnings will grow in the range of high single digits to double digits.
On the positive side, we expect Capital earnings to be slightly better, and our corporate costs will be lower. Previously
we were at $3.5 billion in corporate costs, and we're now targeting $3 billion, so that's an improvement of $500 million.
We expect to hit our margin goals, and we are on track to drive SG&A as a percentage of revenue to 15% by 2014,
while organic growth could be at the lower end of the range. We've reflected the changes that we've seen in the market,
and we're going to be aggressive on costs as we go through the year. So on balance, the rest of the framework remains
unchanged.
And finally, just in summary, some of our markets in the first quarter of 2013 were more challenging than expected.
Europe was tougher, and some of the short cycle markets were slower in March, and we saw some push-outs. But

despite that, we still plan to achieve our full-year EPS framework, really based on Power & Water strengthening,
stronger backlog and deliveries, capital strength, and more cost out. And we plan to achieve our margin goals.
We ended the quarter with a very strong cash position of $90 billion consolidated and $22 billion at the parent. And we
plan to return $18 billion to investors in dividends and buyback while continuing to execute on bolt-on acquisitions. So
in a challenging environment, we're committed to delivering for investors.
So, Trevor, let me turn it back to you and let's take some questions.
Trevor A. Schauenberg
Great, thanks, Jeff. Thank you, Keith. Derek, let's open up the phone lines for questions. I know we have another
earnings call later today, so let's try to limit the questions to two a piece today if we could today. Thank you.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Just on the margin targets, Jeff, and I don't want to make you repeat yourself for the third time
today, but just to be clear, you are expecting to make the 70 bps for the year, including Power & Water, right, not
excluding Power & Water?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes, including Power & Water, Scott. I think we started the year with more than we needed
at 130 basis points to 140 basis points. We spent a little bit of that in the first quarter, but we see Power & Water
strengthening for the year. We think the margin rate for Power & Water will be flat year over year. And even with that,
we expect margin rates to grow by 70 basis points, and we still have a hedge in that number. This is not an uncommon
profile for us, Scott, in terms of the way that the year lines up and stuff. I don't know, Keith. Do you want to...
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Sure.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: ...just go through some of the dynamics of margins?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Sure. Let me just start with the profile, and then we can go back to the pieces if you want, Jeff.
Over the last seven years on average, over the last seven years we always have margin growth from the first quarter to
the total year. And in five of the last seven years, we have declines in the first quarter, so it's not an uncommon profile
for us. We grow our margins from the first quarter anywhere between 50 basis points and 280 basis points. On average,
it's about 150 basis points. And in 2006 and 2010, we grew our margins approximately what we need for 2013. So it's
not uncommon, and we do have a lot of work to do. And we can take you through the pieces either by the categories or
by business, Scott, whatever you'd like.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So, Scott, I think that's what everybody's – that's what we've got in all of our expectations
and all the execution models for the team.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, fair enough. And as a follow-up, when you think about this backlog that you're building
and book-to-bill is solid and such, but are you booking this backlog at a margin that's accretive to your existing margin
structure that helps yield some confidence, one for the 70 bps, but also set us up for 2014 to see operating margins
continue to move forward?

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So the margins in backlog are actually higher. We've had good pricing, Scott, for the past
five quarters. And our value gap, when you really hone in, our value gap is wildly positive. We had a very strong value
gap in the first quarter. That's only going to ramp for the year. So the value gap could be $800 million-plus this year,
and so I think that all portends to good health in the backlog.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.

Your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa, JPMorgan Chase.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: I guess just my first question is on a little bit of I guess housekeeping on Oil & Gas. Definitely a
weaker performance than I was expecting, the margin down year over year, the orders there have been trending really
well. You said turbo machinery was down. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color around what drove the
downside there?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Are you talking about top line, or are you talking about orders?
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Top line and profit, I guess both.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: If you look – I'll start overall with orders. Turbo machinery had very strong orders. They were
up 70%. It was driven by strong upstream. Again, those are a little longer cycle in terms of when they deliver. Drilling
and surface was up 48%. We had more BOPs and risers up. Pressure control was up and artificial lift was up. Subsea,
we had one big order delayed in the quarter. We had about a little under $500 million associated with a large subsea
project that has been pushed. We think that's pushed into the third quarter.
And on revenue, turbo machinery revenues were down in the quarter. I think some of this is timing. We had large LNG
projects in the quarter relative to last year's Gorgon and LNG projects, Curtis project in Australia. Drilling and surface
was up 6%, with artificial lift up 15%. And subsea was down 10%. Again, we had some tough timing relative to
projects last year. But the backlog itself is up a couple billion dollars. And pricing is up for the eighth quarter in a row,
and it's a little longer cycle.
I think the only softness in M&C services was something we're watching. It was a little less than we expected, a little
over $100 million, as we just saw some push-outs and people pushing out investment decisions. But the core of Oil &
Gas subsea drilling and production turbo machinery has a very good outlook in terms of equipment deliveries.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Great.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, these guys were on a profit basis probably 30 basis points or 40 basis points weaker
than I really wanted them to do this quarter. I still think this business is going to be high single-digit revenue, strong
double-digit operating profit growth for the year. I think what Keith mentioned, we saw late in the quarter a flow
business on the control side that's something that we're not counting on necessarily getting better for the year, but was
just around the edges, or else I think we would have done better in the quarter.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Got you, and then one just to follow up. Again, we're sitting here in a tough macro. This
happened in the fourth quarter. I guess when I look at these results and I listen to you guys explaining what's going on

here, it's mind boggling how many moving parts there are here, especially again in GE Capital. At what point do we
again maybe evaluate the size and complexity of the organization and make I guess a tougher longer-term decision on
the structure of the company? It just seems like a little bit of macro weakness goes a long way, and there are just so
many moving parts to even be able to forecast and manage it has to be a challenge. So I'm just curious as to how you
guys view that in the boardroom.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, let me just go back and tell you what happened vis-à-vis my expectations, and I just
want to maybe talk openly and just give you a thought. I think the industrial side was about $200 million weaker than I
would have planned for, what our internal plan was. We basically saw Europe – Europe was running negative 5%,
negative 8% through February. By the end of the quarter, that was negative 15%. That was a pretty big move. I think
you've seen it reflected in a lot of other companies' announcements. On the short-cycle stuff, we saw pushes pretty
consistent with what other people have seen.
Now, given the volatile time, the leadership team created multiple hedges in the plan. We had a $500 million – we were
always running corporate for less than what we needed. We had other hedges in the company. So by the time you put it
all together, we're basically consistent with commitments, which is the way you'd want us to run the place. So I just
think, look, I think we're explaining $200 million out of a big company, but we've been able to offset that through other
hedges and operating disciplines we've got inside the company, which is I think what you want us to do.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, I guess.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So that's my story.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: I appreciate it. I think this year is obviously – again, we're sitting here and it's back-end loaded.
So the second half is a very serious commitment that I know a lot of the investors I talk to are going to be watching
very closely, so I appreciate the comments and good luck.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, we're focused on it as well. It's the way the – all the comp plans are driven, and the
basic cycle of Power & Water is more or less consistent with the way we had talked about the year.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: This is a Power & Water story. If you look, our revenues, taking out the NBC gain, you're
looking at Industrial sales down $1.3 billion. Thermal and Wind are down $1.5 billion. This is what we're going to be
wrestling through is that Power & Water volume profile that Jeff showed you.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Right, okay. Thanks for the details, I appreciate it.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Okay, Steve. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good morning. So just, Jeff, you commented on the 2% to 6%, that that's more towards the
lower end of that range for the full year. And it seems that the weakness in Oil & Gas and the weakness in Power &
Water are more a timing issue, so we've seen some push-outs. But the profile seems to be very much in line with what
you had expected. So I'm just wondering what else is driving this down towards the lower end of that range for the full
year. First of all, I think it's prudent to do that because you had a negative 5% in the first quarter, but I'm just
wondering. Maybe in some of the short-cycle businesses, where are we now versus where we were in December?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Nigel, again, I think the way we look at just in total how we run the company is we don't
necessarily assume things are going to get better. So we saw, I'd say, not in a catastrophic, but we saw Europe
marginally get worse during the quarter. We're now not counting on that getting better. We saw a couple of short-cycle
businesses get pushed. We've gone through a pretty granular analysis here of what we think comes back and what we

shouldn't count on. And I think when you do that calculus, we just think the smartest thing to do is to say to investors,
look, we think this could be at the low end of the range because we're not counting on stuff getting better during the
year. If it does, great, but we're not counting on it. And we're going to take out cost accordingly so that we hedge our
bets. So that's really the answer, Nigel, is we just don't count on everything coming back that got pushed, and we don't
count on things that we viewed getting incrementally worse getting better.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. But when we calibrate our models, should we be putting a bit more pressure on Healthcare
and perhaps Home & Business Solutions, or was this fairly evenly spread?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think again, guys, I guess if I were – and Keith, your views as well.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Sure.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think, look. Power & Water, we would like to surprise you guys on the upside as you go
through the year. So think about the Power & Water just profile in the year. And then other than that, I'd say Healthcare
was a smidge weaker than we would have expected. But we still think Oil & Gas and Home & Business and the other
businesses are going to be pretty solid. I don't know, Keith?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Sure, I think you said it exactly right. When you look at what happened in the quarter, we're
trying to take that into account and decide what does it mean for the year and not counting on Europe certainly getting a
lot better. That's going to take it probably to the low end of the organic range. Power & Water we originally thought
would be close to flat. I think today we're saying Power & Water probably for the year will be down a bit, and that's
based on the profile that we saw in the quarter and our expectation of what that means for the year. You do see it
getting better in the second half and you do see the recovery. But in total, it's probably a little weaker than we wanted
for the total year.
The other businesses, we'll see. I think we've got a great backlog in Oil & Gas. We've got to execute on the long-cycle
projects. What will we see in the short-cycle there? We'll have to see. I think Healthcare could be a little – the U.S.
market was a little down. We're talking about plus or minus 1% here, not a lot of change versus our expectations in the
Healthcare model, I would say. So I think it's prudent to plan the way we are. And as Jeff said, we're going to have to
continue to grind away at taking out the costs. We've got more restructuring that will happen through the year, as we
said. We're committed to getting the $1 billion of cost out, and it could be higher based on what we have to do to
right-size this place for this market.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: That makes sense, and a quick one on the internal plan, the 1.3 points of internal target for margin.
Does that include the additional benefit from the restructuring from the NBCU gain because the 1.3 points is higher
than I expected? And some of the...
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yes, it does.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes, it does, Nigel. That's really one of the drivers of the difference.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: All right.

Your question is coming from the line of Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good morning, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Good morning, hi. Yes, Jeff, if I think about the EBIT bridge, you called out four main
items behind that this quarter. Last quarter there was a fifth, which was also service. If I think about service and R&D,

R&D you had said back in January that should be flattish as a margin driver. Do you still believe that? You highlight
the fact that R&D was up 7% in Q1. Is there something extra on R&D pressure maybe around the LEAP-X or
something that we need to think about?
And secondly on Services, you had a plus-plus there for services in the Q4 earnings slides. Services now you've had
four consecutive quarters of flat to down orders. The commentary around European services is obviously very bad. And
I just wondered if your margin guidance embeds a recovery or how much of a recovery in services over the balance of
this year.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yes, I think the services; let me go to that point first. The services we do expect services
improvement as we go through the year. We have some specific items that we're working on. For example, in Power &
Water, as Jeff talked about, we've got these advanced gas path upgrades. We've got over 50 of them that we're working
on for the year. We sold two in the quarter. We've got a number of those in the backlog and a number that still have to
be closed, so I think there are some specific items that we do expect. We have some comparisons in Europe that could
be a little bit better. And the service margin rate was up 30 basis points in the first quarter.
So I think for us, when you look at the four factors on the margin page, mix, which does include equipment versus
services, it was a positive 10 basis points in the quarter. We're estimating it will be flat for the year. We're counting on
less Wind. And we're counting on more GEnx engines, as you saw, but that was in the run rate in the first quarter. And
we're counting on some Services growth, as we expect equipment to grow as we go into the second half. So we do have
some services growth in the plan.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: R&D, Julian, will be flat. I don't expect that to be a headwind. I think we had Aviation and
Oil & Gas in Q1 that were at a higher run rate. But in total, that's going to be flat for the year.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: It will be flat as a percent of sales. It's right in line.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: As a percent of sales, yes. And what Keith said on margin rates, again, I think we've got a
good window on margin accretion in the Service business.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Got it, thanks. And then just secondly on the top line, just on – if you think about
sequestration, I guess, how are you thinking about that playing into your guidance for the revenue outlook in the
military aftermarket and Aviation and also for U.S. Healthcare? Did you see much of an effect, or is it just noise that
caused some push-outs? And did that cause you – was that a factor behind the low end of the revenue growth guidance
comment?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Let me start with Aviation. We have about 90% of our equipment on firm order for the year.
And so as you saw in the quarter, the equipment was actually up in the quarter, equipment deliveries. We believe that
that's going to remain very strong. We're in certain programs that are priorities for the Defense Department, and things
that aren't firm commitment aren't being cut right now.
We did see a decline in service orders. Some of that was versus comparisons we had last year. And we'll have to see
how that plays out for the year. It was down about 14% in the quarter on revenue. I think that's about what the team
expects for run rates on Services. But in the back half of the year, we'll have to see how the sequestration in total plays
out. I think there are a couple of offsets that you've got to think about. One is our international military engine business
is very strong. We had orders for about a little under 200 F110s for the Saudi Air Force. That extends the production
line of the F110 product through 2016. We had India order for the light combat aircraft on the F414 and Switzerland on
the F414. And we've got some significant orders in line for helicopter engines for both the Army and the Navy. So I
think we're concerned about it on the short-cycle side in services. I think it could put some pressure in the back half of
the year.
In terms of Healthcare, the U.S. market was just slow. I don't find it to be – is there one driver? I think it's just the fact
that there's a lot of uncertainty around healthcare. Providers are consolidating, and they're worried about costs and
making profit and they're just being cautious on purchasing. So there we've got to drive our technology and we have to
continue to drive the productivity, and that's what the Healthcare team is going to do. I think their year is going to

Your next question is coming from the line of Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Good morning. I guess the first question is maybe on capital allocation. It dovetails a little bit
to what Steve asked. There was an 8-K that came out about a week after the proxy, outlining that comp is going to be
tied to 2015 industrial profits as a percent of earnings. I'm not sure why that wasn't in the proxy. But the real question is
can you share that target with us? It seems very apropos to the valuation construct in the stock.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Jeff, again, I think the way to think about that is it's going to be consistent with what we talk
about externally vis-à-vis the vision for the company over the next three years. So in many ways, you've got a
perspective for that, I'd say, already.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: And it's a balance of the measurements. We've got accumulative EPS. We've got accumulative
cash. We've got a percent of earnings that are coming out of the Industrial business which we expect to increase
through the growth playbook period here, through that three-year period; as well as a return on total capital, which will
also incorporate what are the returns from both our Industrial side and our Financial Services side, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think, Jeff, if you go back to the December outlook meeting, you'll see the guideposts. And
I think what we tried to do is triangulate between total EPS, wanting to keep that on a certain trajectory, managing the
mix of Industrial, Financial, generating cash, and making sure that a return on total capital. So I'd say the four metrics
we have are pretty interwoven vis-à-vis how we think about value creation and how our investors want us to run the
place.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay, great.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: But I would go to the outlook meeting, Jeff, and just – I think that gives you the guidepost.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: That's what I wanted to clarify, thank you. And then just thinking about Industrial, so I was
just trying to put these pieces together. It looks like you're going to pick up $0.04 in corporate on the lower guide. It
looks like Capital tax rate is $0.04. It's unclear if the Industrial tax rate is a little bit lower, but it feels like you're taking
$0.10 out of Industrial. Is that the right way to think about it? And could you share why corporate actually is going to
be lower than you thought?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think, Jeff, what we're basically saying is when you think about the segments, I wouldn't
change any of those other than necessarily Power & Water. And I think we basically guided Power & Water flat, and
we're saying that could be down slightly. So I don't think we would agree with your math.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yes, it's very high. The Capital tax rate is in the context of the total Capital earnings for the
year. There's going to be a set of asset optimization transactions that we're looking at. Some of them will cause
potentially us to have higher tax benefits. It may also go with lower earnings. So I don't think we're trying to do a direct
offset for Capital.

And for Corporate, basically what we've been able to do, first of all, we had some better performance in the first quarter
from NBC. That won't continue obviously, but that's included in the negative $172 million that we have sitting here.
And then on a run rate basis, we think we're going to be somewhere around $750 million – $775 million of base
corporate expenses. We are getting some benefits from our simplification efforts. We have lower spending across the
corporate functions. They're going to be down 10% for the year. And that benefit will help us on our overall cost goals
of getting $1 billion-plus out for the year, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay, great. That's very effective. Thank you very much.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Okay.

Your next question is from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan, Nomura.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Hey. Good morning, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, can you give us the gas turbine and wind turbine unit orders for the quarter?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Sure. Gas turbines, we had eight units in the quarter. We had four steam turbines versus one.
On the wind turbines, hang on one second. I know I have it. It was down, but it was still – on renewables, we had 584
wind turbines versus 696 last year, so it's down about 30%.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And so just thinking about this, you shipped 12 gas turbines. You got orders for
eight. What's going on by geography in that number? Those are – I don't know when was the last time those were that
low, but that's a pretty low number. What are you seeing geographically, and do you have any visibility into things
getting better?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yes, I think they're very spread, obviously, in the quarter. We've got a couple in Latin
America, a couple in the Middle East, and one in Russia, one in ASEAN, one in the U.S., so they're spread out. I think
as you look forward, we're expecting to be somewhere between – around 120 to 130 gas turbines for the year in orders,
so you're going to see that pick up through the year. We do see some heavy activity in the Middle East. We've got some
in EMEA and we've got some in Latin America and we've got some in Africa. So it's pretty spread. I think there's some
core activity in the Middle East, which will be the foundation of that activity for the year.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Actually, Shannon, in the McCoy Report we were up three points of share in gas turbine in
2012, so our position is still strong. And I think what Keith said, it's still our expectation to have 120-ish of orders in
the year.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then just to follow up on the mix question, so in terms of getting to the 65%
Industrial earnings with the mix adjustments to this year that you made today, obviously, 2013 is not going to be a year
that really gets you far in that direction to the target. With Power & Water tracking below what you thought, does this
reassess your route to the target in terms of organic methods versus portfolio moves?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Again, that – I go back, Shannon, look. I'd say the quarter was – the macro was a little bit
tougher than we had expected coming into it, but we still expect to have a really good year industrially inside the
company. And so I still think there is a good chance that our percentage of earnings in Industrial grows this year, even
with the adjustments that we made today. And look, we've always been very open on portfolio moves vis-à-vis what
we're trying to do in GE Capital around really focusing on the green assets and being very open in an investor-friendly
way to look at the portfolio. So we'll continue to work that, but we'll do it in a smart way. We'll do it in an
investor-friendly way.

Again, I think if you go back to the question Jeff asked earlier, total EPS is a metric. How we allocate capital is a
metric. Industrial percentage of earnings is a metric. Total CFOA is a metric. So we're going to drive value around all
four of those metrics as we look at it going forward. But we expect to have a good year industrially this year.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Sure. And you look at Capital, we ended the quarter with $402 billion of ENI. It's down $32
billion from last year. There's not a lot of just huge transactions in there. We're continuing to run off. We've got over
$60 billion of non-core assets. We continue to run those off. The real estate gain enabled us to add to the current real
estate plan with another $2 billion of equity assets that we expect to exit this year. And so you're going to continue to
see asset declines based on the red asset runoffs. If we can get a little better GDP and a little higher growth in the CLL
business, that would be great. But right now, you'd say that that market continues to be relatively flat for asset growth,
and we need a little better economy to see that pick up. So right now, I would expect that you're going to continue to
see ENI declines in GE Capital.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: All right, Shannon.

Your next question is from the line of John Inch, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, John.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: I just want to pick up on the capital issue. What, Jeff and Keith, do you think is the dilution
associated with capital downsizing, say, in 2013 year over year? And obviously, that includes some of the actions that
you described based on the gains that you were opportunistically able to leverage this quarter.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Just on actual volume down, if you took $35 billion at a 1.5% return, that would be a total year
estimate of the lost margin, lost earnings that they have. Now they offset some of that with cost. Our new business
volume has been at better returns. But that will size it for you roughly, if that's what you're asking, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: I know it is. So from an ENI context, Keith, ENI is going to drop to sub-$400 billion I'm
assuming relatively quickly. Where do you think it ends? What's the trajectory ultimately? Is it that you just subtract
the $60 billion and we have some optionality around some of the other possible investments like in offshore banks or
some of the other stuff, or is there some other offset to that?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: The team is not trying to just have $60 billion of non-core assets go out and not grow the core
business. We're actually trying to remix, as you know. So far, though, if you look at the last couple years, our runoff of
non-cores exceeded our remixing. So it depends upon what that remixing looks like. Right now, we continue to be
active in the market. Our organic volume is mid – low single digits, and we have a lot of refinancing that has occurred.
We would like to acquire some portfolios. If we could find the price to match our objectives on returns, we would do
that. So we have capacity, obviously. We've been shrinking and building up the equity.
But so far, if you just look at what has happened so far, the runoff of non-core has exceeded the remix into the green
assets, and we'll see what happens. As we have said in the framework discussions, big material portfolio moves are not
part of the base plan, but we're going to look at those opportunistically. We do have some value maximizing franchises
in the business obviously. And if we had the opportunity to move some of those based on the market or buyers or a
better appetite, we would definitely evaluate those. But right now, the base plan is to continue to remix. If you look at
the last couple years, the runoff has exceeded the core growth, and we'll see how that plays out. And we do have
opportunity on value maximizing.

<Q - John G. Inch>: That's helpful, thanks. As a follow-up, could you guys spend just a second on China? It actually
seemed to be one of the brighter spots in your quarter. And just in terms of – China was obviously – was in a recession
last year. What are you seeing today in your businesses there and the trajectory? And maybe you can put it into context
of price and orders and just how you're feeling about that market and its future contribution.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So what I would say, John, is look, we had revenue up double digits last year. We had
revenue up double digits in the quarter, and we had orders that were up 60%.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Almost 70%.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Almost 70%. So the way I always try to answer this is that we are a composite of the
businesses we're in and not necessarily a reflection of everything. So if you think about our three biggest businesses,
which are Aviation, Healthcare, and Power & Water, all three of them are in a pretty good cycle right now. Healthcare
continues to grow strong double digits.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Healthcare was up 14%.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Aviation was very...
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Aviation was up -favorable. It had $900 million of orders. Oil & Gas was a good quarter, up
76%. Energy & Power was down about 30%. But overall...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: But Power has got the gas tailwind over time with more gas turbine demand vis-à-vis coal
and other fuels. But I think over the long term, it's going to portend well.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So we believe China is going to be a good story.
<Q - John G. Inch>: I guess the question is Europe, not just for GE but others, downside surprise this quarter. It
sounds like China was a little bit of an upside surprise. Do you think this trend is sustainable, or is there some sort of a
– some kind of a first of the year blip or aberration because of the timing of who knows what? Just something perhaps
that...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: John, I think our growth region story is still pretty strong, orders up 17% overall. I don't
think we see this as a – we see this as more of a tailwind than a headwind for the year.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: I think you've got to levelize the 70% order rate. We're planning on double-digit order rates in
China, and the start to the year gives us confidence that we'll have that for the year.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Got it. Thanks, guys.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yes.

Your next question is coming from the line of Deane Dray, Citi Research.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Deane.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: I was hoping to get some color on the updated restructuring plans for the balance of the
year. The initial plan was the bulk was coming in, in the second and third quarter. I see some has slipped into the fourth
quarter, but just comment on the timing. What are the areas you're able to talk about on the balance of these
restructurings, the payback? And just we do recognize that these will be excluded from operating results because

you've had part of that gain slip through or fall through on the first quarter.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: That's right. We've tried to give you the profile. And in the second, third, and fourth quarter,
it's really a function of getting all of the work complete to be able to meet the criteria required to do the accounting. We
have to have the plan finalized. We have to take all the actions, including getting whatever approvals might be required
of works councils or negotiating with unions that we have contractually in place. And some of those things are just
going to fold off – fold into the second, third, and fourth quarter. And some of that money that's in the second, third,
and fourth quarter is related to projects we've already approved. It's just the timing of getting those expenses accrued on
the restructuring will fall into those later quarters.
So the majority of it is going to be head count and plant closing and site closings. We continue to downsize our
footprint. And as part of simplification, people are reducing the number of profit and loss centers across the company.
We are reducing the number of business sites. We're consolidating into common-lease facilities. We're closing some of
our older capacity plants. You've seen some of that in the U.S., and consolidating into different facilities that are more
productive. So we've just got a tremendous amount of activity. It's spread across the world. It's about probably about a
half in the U.S. and the rest spread between Europe and Asia and a little bit in Latin America. And it's substantially
reductions in compensation and benefits and then facilities.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. I know we're past...
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: The payback is about 18 months, Deane. You asked about the payback.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Yes, okay. Thank you.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yes.

Your next question is from the line of Steve Winoker, Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Hey. Just to switch gears to Capital for a second, any reason that you'd have to believe that
the context is different in terms of thinking about the dividend announcement that was made roughly in May last year
as you look out now; any reason to believe that things have shifted in a way such that we should be thinking about that
differently in 2013 versus what happened in 2012?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: I don't believe so. As you know, we're not one of the CCAR entities. We do go through our
own process that mirrors a lot of that activity one on one with our regulator. We don't comment on any of those
discussions. We have done, obviously, stress tests and capital plans, and we'll work constructively with them on that.
And our current expectation is that the timing would be similar to last year. And if that changes, we'll let you know. But
that's our current expectation, Steve.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, the ENI is lower and the ratios are better. So, GE Capital is in a very strong position
right now.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay, great. And just a minor question, but Safran had talked about $200 million of
additional spend on the LEAP-X and Silvercrest, so it's obviously across two engines there. But I'm just trying to
equate your responsibility on the LEAP-X side. Have we seen whatever tick-up there might be already because they
said that was additional spending that we're going to be doing going forward? Have we seen that with you guys

already?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: You saw the R&D in Aviation is up. We do expect and have that in the run rate. The tradeoff
that we have is the GEnx spending on the PIP [Performance Improvement Package] programs comes down, but
Aviation is spending a lot of money. In total for R&D, we expect it to be flat as a percent of revenue for the business.
Aviation will probably be a little higher than the other businesses. And it's in line with all of the new programs that they
have, as you said, the LEAP, the Passport, the finish of the PIP programs on the GEnx.

And the next question is from the line of Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thank you very much, a couple questions.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Good morning, just a question on restructuring. So I think you mentioned that there is an
18-month payback on restructuring.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: That's right.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: So can you just talk about what was the margin cushion before the NBCU divestiture when you
upped the restructuring targets?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: It was more than 70 basis points. The restructuring, obviously, is added to it. I don't have that
broken out specifically. It did give us...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: A couple hundred million bucks, maybe something like that.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Sure, in terms of dollars.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Okay. But from that perspective, that should flow into 2014 as well, right?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes. Look, like I said, we're going to – by 2014, SG&A as a percentage of revenue is going
to be 15%. We're on that path and we're going to stay on that path.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And can you just give...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just a little bit more granularity as to which businesses you're going to do restructuring in
throughout the year, how that will flow business by business through the year, if you can do that.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: I don't have it split by business. I think it would be pretty similar to the profile that I gave you.
I gave you the dollars by business for the first quarter's restructuring. I don't see any reason why we wouldn't have a
little higher proportion into Power & Water, Energy Management, and Healthcare.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Terrific, thank you very much.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Those would be the three priorities.
