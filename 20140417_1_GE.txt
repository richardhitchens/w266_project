Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everybody. Hey, look, the GE team had a good quarter in a volatile but improving
environment. The U.S. gets a little bit better every day. Europe is improving. The growth markets continue to expand
and will provide growth during the year even with volatility. We had strength across most of our portfolio as global
infrastructure markets remained solid.
We continue to benefit in energy, oil and gas and aviation sectors, and we saw some improvement in the demand for
credit. At the same time we encountered a few headwinds in the quarter. Weather impacted our Appliances business
that improved in March. Transportation was impacted by mining inventory corrections and the U.S. healthcare market
continue to experience volatility.
Some of this improved as the quarter progressed. Our execution was strong. Industrial segment growth was up 12%,
above our 10% goal. Organic growth was up 8%, above our 4% to 7% goal. Margin growth was 50 basis points and
we're on track to meet our goal of 17% margins by 2016. Our capital earnings and cash were in line with our
expectations for the year. We returned $3.4 billion to investors in dividends and buyback and announced $2 billion of
foreign acquisitions. And finally, we submitted our SEC filing for Synchrony, the [ph] OFS spin-out (02:51). This is an
important step as we head for our 70% industrial goal.
We delivered $0.33 of operating EPS, up 9%, excluding the impact of NBCU gains in 2013 and restructuring. This is
the kind of quarter GE investors should like. The environment was not perfect, but we're able to deliver strong results
due to the breadth of our portfolio.
Our orders were flat overall. Backlog grew to $245 billion and orders pricing was up 0.4 points. While equipment
orders can be lumpy, service orders – things like Aviation spares – tend to be a good gauge of the underlying economy,
and we saw broad strength in our service businesses with four or six segments up double digits. Six of nine growth
regions grew orders by double digits in the quarter. Equivalent orders were down in Aviation and Oil & Gas versus
tough comps in 2013 but we have a great backlog in position in each market and feel good about their long-term
growth.
In Transportation, we see a strengthening market for North America locomotives and we won a very large order for kits
for South Africa. I would like to point out two other factors on orders. First, we see the pipeline building so we feel
good about growth during the year. And second, we have grown backlog by $29 billion for the first quarter of 2013
with growth in every segment. This fortifies our ability to hit goals this year and in the future.
The company executed well in the first quarter. Industrial operating profit growth of 12% is a good start to the year.
Organic growth was up 8%. Growth markets continue to provide momentum with five of nine up double digits and 7%
growth overall. We make great progress in services with Aviation spares up 22% and 17% advanced gas paths up from
two last year. Equipment revenue grew by 12%.
Our products are winning in the market with excellent growth in Power, Oil & Gas and Aviation. For instance, we're
well-positioned throughout our gas turbine product line extending to the H turbine which has more than 61% efficiency
and more than 400 megawatts of output. Our Revolution CT just received FDA approval and should drive positive
growth for the year.
Europe grew by 14% in the first quarter so we're starting to get stabilization in that market as well. Our target is to
grow margins this year. We're off to a good start. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of expansion with 50 basis
points of growth. We're driving simplification throughout the company and our restructuring efforts are paying off. We
generated about $250 million of structural cost out of the quarter. And value gap had a positive 50 basis point impact
on margins. We're getting traction with our Fastworks initiative, which is improving R&D efficiency. Mix was a
headwind but our productivity programs more than offset.
Finally, we expect broader business participation in the future. Healthcare, energy management and appliances, lighting
should have positive margin and operating profit expansion for the rest of 2014 based on improving markets and
restructuring.

Our CFOA is off to a good start and on track for the year. We generated $1.7 billion, up from $200 million last year.
The company has substantial financial strength with $87 billion of consolidated cash and close to $12 billion at the [ph]
parent (05:56). As you know, we issued $3 billion of debt in the quarter. GE Capital remains in great shape with a Tier
1 common ratio of 11.4%. And meanwhile, commercial paper was in a very low level of $25 billion and total ENI of
$374 billion was down 7%.
We've allocated capital in a disciplined and balanced way. We continue to invest in plant and equipment to grow the
company globally. Our dividend was up 16% year-over-year. We plan to reduce the float in 2014 and we're on track to
reduce share count to 9 million to 9.5 million (sic) [9 billion to 9.5 billion] (06:26) shares by the end of 2015 including
the retail spend.
And we will continue to bolt-on acquisitions like the three we announced so far this year. Our target remains $1 billion
to $4 billion but we have gone above on opportunistic deals that have excellent values, strong synergies, fit our growth
strategies and are immediately accretive. For instance, Avio was above our range and accretive to investors. At the
same time, we plan for about $4 billion of dispositions this year.
Now I'll turn it over to Rod Christie who runs our Subsea business as Matt said earlier. We plan to review an important
segment or initiative each quarter. As the year goes on, we plan to cover topics like heavy-duty gas turbine technology,
Healthcare Life Sciences, China and other important operating initiatives or organic growth opportunities.
So now I'll turn it over to Rod.
Rod Christie
Thanks, Jeff. So starting on the left side of the page, I want to give you a flavor of how we see the long-term prospects
for the oil and gas industry before we drill into the subsea sector specifically. The forecast is for global oil and gas
demand to continue to grow through 2018, with oil mainly driven by the ongoing industrialization in emerging
economies and the rise of living standards. While gas emerged as across mainly all of the economies as a cleaner fuel
source.
In addition to the increasing demand, the other dynamic to consider here is well decline rates on existing operations of
around 3% to 4% onshore and 6% to 10% offshore. The combination of both these factors makes ongoing investment
necessary to develop new reserves and enhance the recovery in existing assets.
Moving to the top right of the page, we see these dynamics driving 4% and 2% CAGRs and production rates for Oil &
Gas, respectively, through 2018. And expectation is for stronger growth in subsea and unconventional production.
Translating all of this into total industry spend, we expect to see continued growth as IOCs, NOCs and independents
work to recover more hydrocarbons from existing assets and bring on new reserves to meet the growing demand. With
respect to subsea sector, the expectation for long-term development of deepwater reserves is supported by the robust
activity we see in drilling and front-end engineering design through the cycle.
Given this expectation, our Subsea Systems business is well-positioned to serve customers with both technology and
life-of-field services across the globe. Our extensive capabilities enable us to provide everything from discrete
components to full Subsea production systems. We're also uniquely placed against our competitors in that we can
leverage technology from other GE businesses and run joint technology programs specific to the critical need.
To give you a couple of examples here, we cooperate with GE's Monitoring and Controls business in the area of subsea
integrity management and leverage their sensory and diagnostics technology specifically developed for our own space.
We're also running a joint technology program with GE's Power Conversion business for subsea power and drives. This
really enables us to develop value-added solutions under one roof wherever the core competency actually exists inside
GE. Likewise, GE gives us the ability to scale up. As many of you be aware, localization is often a mandatory
requirement in our industry.

When we move into new geographies, it's not unusual to find other GE businesses are already there, usually inside the
Power & Water or another Oil & Gas business. This means we can leverage their relationships, their knowledge and
potentially their footprint. Additionally, we've been working with GE's Global Growth and Operations team to
accelerate development in countries like Nigeria and Angola where we can benefit from their high-level relationships
and the back-office support to get things up and running very quickly.
Today, we're present in all the major deepwater basins around the world, such as Brazil, sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and
Australia, while still retaining significant capability around both the U.K. and Norwegian continental shelves. Our
experience in extreme cold water and long [indiscernible] (10:24) capabilities for controls and for power solutions
position us well for future Arctic activity. Effectively, it's going to require really no topsides and have the added
complexity really of an icy, barren environment.
So two years ago, a major subsea industry survey took feedback from 135 customers and ranked each supplier against
the top priorities of the subsea oil and gas operators. The chart in the left of this page details how GE was rated against
our competitors back in 2012. As you can see, we performed well in the key areas like EHS, reliability and technology.
However, we were midpack when it came to on-time delivery, and in fact, really none of the suppliers are performing
consistently to exceptional level in this critical requirement. This is one of the main risks to both the supplier and the
customer in this industry and a significant number of large-scale subsea development experienced both schedule and
cost overruns.
Given that the timing and carrying costs for initial CapEx outlay on these projects, the key driver in overall returns we
have focused investments to differentiate performance around cycle and on-time delivery. As of today, we offer a suite
of structured products that offer modular customization to our customers.
So I'm just going to expand a little bit on modularization. What that really means is we can provide exactly what the
customer wants and we do it with less engineering and less supply chain risk as we use a standard module to do so.
We've also completed significant process reengineering to drive speed and transparency across our business operations.
We've created a global project COE that interfaces directly to all of our sites and suppliers and supports our project
teams wherever they're operating in the world. To underpin this, we've also invested in an integrated IT infrastructure
that enables us to scale the organization through industry cycles without losing either capability or impacting our
operational excellence.
The final piece of this jigsaw really has been the investments we've made, including new capacity and unlocking latent
capacity in a number of our factories. Today, using Lean Manufacturing disciplines, we've increased capacity for trees,
controls, wellheads and manifolds. In general, we've been able to realize capacity increases between 30% and 100% in
our existing facilities and have commissioned new capacity in Indonesia and Brazil. And sure, we feel we're very
well-placed to take on new commitments. Growth in the deepwater oil and gas sector looks strong over the long-term
and we feel very confident about our competitiveness of both our existing product lines and the technologies we have
in development.
The investments we've made in capacity and capability also put us in a great position to support our customers
wherever they operate in the world. Just to give you some context in the evolution of the Subsea Systems business, in
2011 we were executing a handful of small projects in two subsea production EPC projects, the largest of which was
around $600 million. Today, we're executing eight EPC projects, the largest of which exceeds $1.3 billion. The
programs we've undertaken to structure our products, [ph] re-enhance (13:29) supply chain and project operations are
yielding results in cycle time reduction and cost reduction.
And we expect to see further benefits come from these as we drive these deeper into our business. Just to give you
some context here, 1Q revenue we saw a 37% increase year-over-year and a 3x increase in both margin and in rate. On
top of this, our global footprint really makes us local and capable in the main deepwater basins today and GE's reach
means we can move quickly and at scale in any of the developing geographies.
Overall, we really feel very good about the fundamentals of this business and really have to say that I'm very excited
about the way this moves in the future.

So with that, I'll pass it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Great. Thanks, Rod. I'm going to start with operations in the quarter then we'll move to the segments. We had
continuing operations revenues of $34.2 billion, down 2% from the first quarter of 2013. Industrial sales of $24 billion
were up 8% and GE Capital revenues of $10.5 billion were down 8%. Operating earnings of $3.3 billion were down
18% and operational earnings per share of $0.33 were down 15%, principally driven by NBCU as Jeff mentioned
earlier.
On the next page, I'll take you through more detail on the normalized EPS walk versus last year. Continuing EPS of
$0.29 includes the impact of non-operating pension, the net earnings per share of $0.30 includes the impact of
discontinued operations. We had $12 million benefit in the quarter in discontinued operations with no material impact
from WMC. Pending claims for WMC declined to $4.5 billion reflecting $1.2 billion of resolutions with reserves
declining in line with expectations. New pending claims in the quarter were negligible.
As Jeff said, first quarter CFOA was $1.7 billion, we had Industrial cash flow of $1.2 billion and received $500 million
of dividends from GE Capital. The GE tax rate for the quarter was 24% and the GE Capital rate was 9%. For the year,
we're still expecting the GE rate to be around 20% and the GE Capital rate to be in the single digits.
On the right side, you can see the segment results and, as Jeff mentioned, performance was mixed by business but
overall pretty good, with Industrial segment revenues up 8% and operating profit up 12%. GE Capital earnings were
flat in the quarter on lower assets.
Now I'll take you through the dynamics of each of the segments on the pages that follow. First on the other items page,
I'll start with the adjusted EPS walk. So last year, as you'll recall, we had operating EPS of $0.39 in the first quarter.
This included $0.10 of gains and income from NBC that was offset by $0.04 of Industrial restructuring and other items.
We also had a $0.05 gain at GE Capital from the sale of 30 Rock that was offset by other charges as well. That walk
gets you to an adjusted operating EPS of $0.33 last year. This quarter we had $0.03 of Industrial restructuring and other
items. Making the same adjustment for 2014 gets you to $0.36, and that's up 9% on an adjusted basis. That's how we're
thinking about operating performance in the quarter.
On the right side as I mentioned, we had $0.03 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other items, as we
continue to invest in simplification to improve the company's cost structure. The spend was broad-based with projects
in every business and Corporate. We're executing more than 150 projects that average about a year-and-a-half payback.
The projects relate to everything from manufacturing, footprint reduction, service shop consolidations, SG&A actions
and exiting low-margin product lines, primarily in developed markets.
We're continuing to work through timing of European Work Council approvals and on the positive side, some of the
projects are coming in below our original cost estimates with no downgrade of benefits. For the year, we still anticipate
$1 billion to $1.5 billion of restructuring with about 60% of that in the first half and we're still planning on delivering
more than $1 billion of industrial costs out for the year. As we told you in November, we expect to have some
dispositions in our industrial portfolio in 2014 and we're currently working on a transaction related to a non-core asset
that may result in a small gain, likely in the second quarter, potentially in the third quarter.
Now I'll take you through each of the segments starting with Power & Water. Orders of $5.7 billion were up 9%.
Equipment orders of $2.6 billion were down 3% driven by renewables down 13%. That was partially offset by
Distributed Power which was up 9% and Thermal was up 3%. Wind orders totaled 422 turbines versus 584 turbines in
the first quarter of 2013. Our view of wind orders for the year has not changed. We still expect strong growth. We took
orders for 31 gas turbines in the first quarter of this year versus eight a year ago.
Service orders were $3.1 billion, higher by 23%. The growth was primarily driven by PGS, up 32%, up 43% ex Europe.
The business had orders for 17 AGPs versus two AGPs a year ago as well as a large $330 million upgrade order in

Japan. Europe continues to be very, very soft.
Backlog in Power & Water continued to grow with equipment higher by 18% and services by 2% year-over-year. OPI
in the quarter was negative 40 basis points driven by equipment. Revenue in the quarter of $5.5 billion was up 14%.
Equipment revenues were up 41% driven by wind shipments of 646 units, 345 units higher than the first quarter of
2013 and Thermal was up five gas turbines shipping 17 gas turbines versus 12 gas turbines a year ago. We shipped all
but one wind turbine associated with the blade quality issue in the fourth quarter.
Service revenues were down 5% as AGP performance was offset by weakness in Europe. Segment operating profit was
24% higher on strong volume and simplification benefits partly offset by negative mix associated with wind. SG&A in
the quarter was down 9% year over year. The wind blade quality issues in the quarter were negligible. Margins
expanded for the quarter 120 basis points.
Next is Oil & Gas. Oil & Gas orders for the quarter of $4.6 billion were down 5% with equipment orders down 17%
and service growth of 11%. Equipment orders were down versus a tough comparison to last year when orders were up
24%. Subsea equipment was down 62% principally on timing. As we've commented previously, orders in Oil & Gas
tend to be very lumpy on a quarterly basis. And as Rod shared with you, we expect Subsea orders to be up double digits
for the total year.
We continued to see good growth in Turbomachinery solutions, up 16% in the quarter on two large wins in the U.S.
LNG space. The Downstream Technology was also strong, up 48%. Service orders of $2.2 billion were higher by 11%
led by Turbomachinery, up 22%, and Downstream Technology Solutions, up 20%. That was partly offset by M&C,
which was down 7%.
Backlog continues to grow in Oil & Gas, with equipment up 15% and services up 4% versus prior year. Orders pricing
was better by 140 basis points in the quarter. Revenue was up 27%, up 18% ex Lufkin and Subsea was up 37%;
Turbomachinery up 25%; Downstream Solutions up 24%; and drilling and service was up 13% while M&C was down
4%. We expect M&C to be flat for the total year.
Operating profit was strong in the quarter, up 37%, up 28% ex Lufkin. The growth was driven by volume, value gap,
base cost productivity and the absence of the FX charge we had last year in the first quarter. This was partly offset by
negative mix on lower M&C volume. Our operating profit rate improved 80 basis points in the quarter, both with and
without Lufkin.
Turning to the next page on Aviation, just some context here, air travel continued to grow strongly. Global revenue
passenger kilometers grew 6.9% through February compared to 5.2% a year ago, with a particular strength in the
Middle East, Asia, Europe and China. Through February, freight growth was up 3.6% versus 1.4% a year ago and that
growth was driven by Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. Orders in the quarter of $5.5 billion were down 17%
as expected, driven by equipment orders down 38% to $2.4 billion. The first quarter of 2013 we had $1.4 billion of
CFM LEAP large orders and two large China GE90 orders.
Commercial engine backlog ended the quarter at $21 billion. That's 16% higher versus last year and military equipment
orders of $421 million were up 44% driven by demand for CT7 engines. Service orders were $3.1 billion up 10% and
commercial service orders were up 12% driven by strong commercial spare parts up 17% to $29.7 million a day.
Military service orders were up 18% driven by spare parts up 19% on strong demand for T700 spares. Orders pricing
was strong at 2.6% in the quarter.
Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 14%, up 10% ex Avio. Equipment revenue was higher by 14% on strong price and
shipments of 646 commercial engines versus 596 last year. We shipped 70 GEnx engines versus 41 a year ago and
military revenues were down 3% on 31 fewer engines in the quarter. Service revenue, $2.9 billion, was up 14% driven
by commercial up 18% and military down 5%. Commercial spare shipments were $28.5 million a day. That was up
22% versus last year. Operating profit of $1.1 billion was up 19%, 14% ex Avio on strong value gap and volume.
Margin rates improved 90 basis points, 80 basis points ex Avio. Avio continues to perform very well and overall good
execution in the Aviation business in the quarter.

Next on Healthcare, the first quarter in the U.S. was soft. Hospitals and clinics appeared to be delaying purchases in
responses to the ACA. Patient inflows, outpatient visits, ER, surgeries, procedures were all down 1% to 1.7% in the
quarter and preliminary NEMA data suggests the U.S. market was down single digits, excluding one big VA bulk order
from several years ago. Our NEMA orders were down 2% so we believe we actually gained share in the quarter a point
or two.
As a result of these dynamics, Healthcare's first quarter was softer than we expected. Orders of $4.2 billion were down
1% driven by the U.S. down 4%, offset by continued strength in emerging markets which were up 10%. China was up
13%, Latin America was up 10% and the Middle East was up 47%. Europe was also strong up 4%. Equipment orders
of $2.3 billion were flat and HCS emerging market orders were higher by 13%, offset by the U.S. down 12%. Life
Science orders were up 1% in the quarter.
Service orders were $1.9 billion and they were down 2% in the quarter. First quarter backlog was $16.3 billion which
was up 7% versus prior year and order pricing was down 1.5%. Revenues of $4.2 billion were down 2% with
equipment down 2%, services down 3%. Operating profit of $570 million was down 4% driven by negative value gap
offset by strong base cost management. SG&A in our healthcare business was down 9% in the quarter. The business
expects U.S. softness to probably persist in the second quarter but expect to continue to gain share and deliver earnings
growth for the year.
So with that, we'll move to Transportation. And Transportation has a solid execution quarter given their environment.
In terms of domestic activity, carloads were up 1% in the first quarter driven by intermodal traffic, which was higher by
3%. Coal volume continues to be soft. It was down 1% but petroleum products and petroleum were higher 6.5%.
Orders for the quarter were $2.4 billion. That was up over 100% led by equipment quarters up 4 times. We had orders
for 259 locals and 299 local kits versus 80 locals last year and 25 kits a year ago. We received a large order in South
Africa for 233 kits and had orders for 176 locals in the U.S.
Service orders were down 18% due to weak mining and no repeat in the large Amtrak signaling order we had in the
first quarter of last year. Order price index was flat and backlog was 6% versus the first quarter of 2013. Revenues for
the quarter were down 14% as we anticipated and equipment was down 20% driven by mining, off-highway vehicles
down 76% partly offset by locomotives up 23%. We shipped 178 locals versus 143 a year ago. Service was down 7%
on weaker mining parts demand. Our profit was down 24%. Very strong costs in productivity performance was more
than offset by volume and mix. Margins were down 230 basis points in the quarter.
On Energy Management, the business continues to be a work in progress as we made a lot of gains in restructuring and
resizing the business around its cost structure, and footprint were offset by sale softness and marine startup execution.
Orders were $2.2 billion. That was down 1%. Digital Energy was up 20% on a large domestic meter order and
Industrial Solutions was up 1%. This was offset by Power Conversion down 16% with no repeat of first quarter 2013
Brazilian drillship orders that we took. The business did continue to build backlog in all its segments with the total up
17% year-over-year to $4.9 billion. Revenue was down 4% in the quarter with Digital Energy down 20%, Industrial
solutions down 3% and Power Conversion down 2%.
Operating profit was $5 million in the quarter. That's down from $15 million a year ago. Despite the poor performance,
we continue to get restructuring benefits and reduced SG&A costs. This was more than offset by negative volume and
execution challenges. We expect this business to improve its results throughout the year particularly in the second half.
Appliances & lighting. Appliances & Lighting had a challenging quarter as well. Appliance revenues were down 3%.
The appliance market was down 4% in February but it was much stronger in March and ended the quarter flat
year-over-year. Housing stock starts were soft with single-family down 8% offset by multi-family strength of about
9%.
Lighting revenue was down 4%. Our traditional channels in lighting were down 9%, partially offset by LED growth up
33%. Segment profit of $53 million was down 33% in the quarter. Appliance op profit was down 2% with higher price
offset by lower volume and negative productivity. In Lighting, our profit was down 44% driven by strong material
deflation more than offset by productivity price and foreign exchange. For both businesses the last two weeks in March

and the first week of April were much stronger. We expect them to be back on track in the second quarter.
Next I'll cover GE Capital. Revenue of $10.5 billion was down 8%, primarily from non-repeat of the 30 Rock sale last
year. Assets were down 3% or $18 billion year-over-year. Net income of $1.9 billion was flat to prior year as lower
losses and impairments offset reduced gains, lower earning assets and tax benefits. ENI ended the quarter at $374
billion. It was down $28 billion or 7% from last year and down $7 billion sequentially. Non-core ENI was down 16%
to $52 billion versus last year.
Net interest margins decreased 11 basis points from 2013 to 4.9% as the slight improvement in business margins was
offset by the cost from carrying higher levels of cash. GE Capital's liquidity and capital levels continue to get stronger.
We ended the quarter with $75 billion of cash and reduced our commercial paper borrowings to $25 billion in the first
quarter. That's nine months ahead of our year-end target. Our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel I basis improved 23 basis
points sequentially and 32 basis points year-over-year to end at 11.4%. On the right side of the page, asset quality
trends continue to be stable.
I'll walk through the segment performances. The Commercial Lending and Leasing business ended the quarter with
$175 billion of assets, flat to last year. On-book core volume was $8 billion, down 2% as we continue to stay
disciplined on pricing and risk hurdles with continued excess liquidity in the markets. New business returns remained
reasonably strong at about 1.8% ROI. Earnings of $564 million were up 42% as result of not repeating a specific
impairment we had last year in the first quarter as well as from asset sales.
On Consumer, the Consumer segment ended the quarter with $132 billion of assets, down 3% from last year but were
up 8% in our North American Retail Finance business. Earnings of $786 million were up 47% as a result of not
repeating $300 million impact from the reserve modeling changes we implemented in the first quarter of 2013. North
American Retail Finance earned $590 million in the quarter. That's up 54%, again largely driven by not repeating the
reserving changes and on strong asset growth of 8% year-over-year.
Real Estate had another solid quarter. Assets at $38 billion were down 11% versus prior year and down $1 billion
sequentially. The equity book is down 29% from a year ago to $13 billion. Net income of $239 million was down 65%
primarily from not repeating the 30 Rock gain. In the current quarter, we sold 165 properties with a book value $1
billion for about $117 million in gains and the debt business earned $120 in the quarter and originated almost $2 billion
of volume at attractive ROIs.
In terms of verticals, GECAS earned $352 million, up 1% as higher core income offset the impact of lower assets,
which were down 8%. New volume was $1.5 billion, 36% higher year-over-year with very attractive returns north of
3% ROIs. And we ended the quarter with zero aircraft on the ground. EFS had a solid quarter with earnings up 84% to
$153 million, driven by strong core income and gains partially offset by impairments. So the team continues to perform
well here and as we look forward to the second quarter, we expect the run rate of GE Capital to be around $1.8 billion
of earnings.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Great, Jeff. Thanks. Finally, on the framework, look, we're re-affirming the framework for the year. We feel good
really about our progress on the Industrial side and we think what you saw in the first quarter in terms of organic
growth, solid organic growth and good margin expansion should continue in the second quarter and throughout the
year. Capital is on track for its plan and CFOA remains on track as well with the framework. There's a lot going on in
Corporate and you understand our goals for restructuring, and we'll give you frequent updates on our progress and,
look, with underlying EPS up 9% in the quarter and strong Industrial segment profit growth, we think we're off to a
good start.
So, Matt, let me turn it back over to you and let's take some questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: 8% core growth is a pretty big number. How do you think about the sustainability of those kind
of levels? It's probably about 2x the sector overall, and then I want to ask a follow-up on margins, but let's just talk
about the core growth first.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Jeff, you want to start and...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, listen, I think we're very happy with the level of growth in the quarter. It reflects a
lot of the order activity we had in 2013. As we said, the short cycle businesses were definitely impacted by weather in
the first quarter, and we expect Industrial solutions, Appliances and Lighting to get better as we move into the second
quarter in the year. We're still on framework. We expect organic growth for the year to be between 4% and 7% and I
think we're pleased that we're off to a strong start here.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Scott, I would just add, I think wind always adds a little bit of noise plus or minus around
each quarter. It was more on the plus side this quarter. And like I said at the outlook meeting in December, we have an
internal plan that adds up to more than the range and that's how we run the businesses and that's – I think we still
believe in the framework for the year but we have an internal plan that adds up to more than that.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Fair enough. And 50 bps of margins, just kind of back of an envelope, 8% core growth
should kind of get you there already but you also talked about having value gap and cost out. Is there any way to parse
out the 50 bps and how you guys think about it, be it fixed cost coverage from the volume leverage and cost out
[indiscernible] (36:28) break down the 50 bps?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, yeah, so mix was a bit of a headwind for us in the quarter, more than 100 basis
points in the quarter. That's the strength in wind, the strength you heard Rod talk about with 37% sales growth in
Subsea while M&C volume was down 7%.
So mix for us in the quarter was about 100 basis points to 120 basis points of headwind and that was offset with strong
value gap, a little bit of favorability in R&D but principally by simplification. We had 160 basis points of favorability
in structural cost and getting at delivering on both the structural cost initiative and delivering on the restructuring
investments we've made and that was partially offset by base cost inflation that generally reflects increases in salary.
So I think we feel very good about the construct of the quarter. It's more or less how we thought about the year and
what we described to you at year-end. We know that we're going to grow equipment and revenue faster than services
this year and so mix will be an item for the year and we have to deliver on simplification to overcome that and grow
margins.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: That's helpful. Just a quick clarification, guys, I haven't heard you mention H series turbine in a
long time. Do you actually have a commercially viable product at this point?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Oh, yeah. I think, Scott, we've gotten a couple commitments and we're in the process of
rolling that out as we speak. So we think this is going to be a great product at really a good time.

The next question comes from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Deane. Good morning.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Hey, Jeff, I was hoping you could expand on your comments on the bolt-on acquisition
outlook. You all have been operating on a self-imposed, investor-friendly range of it was $1 billion to $3 billion and
then got inched up for Avio, $1 billion to $4 billion, and you're clearly signaling a willingness to go a bit higher than
that for the right acquisition. That's the same language you used just before you got Avio, so maybe if you could
expand for us how much higher above $4 billion, what kind of applications or markets look interesting. Is it likely
sounds like you've got something close.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I wouldn't read too much into it, Deane, other than this is the way we answer the question
typically from the standpoint of we do the vast majority of our acquisitions in that range. People ask if you saw
something that was strategic, added to the growth rate, bolt on, well-priced, accretive, would you go above that? And
clearly when we did Avio, that was $4.2 billion and we had $1 billion to $3 billion type of range.
So it's typically the way we answer the question and in investor meetings and at the outlook meeting and things like
that. So again, I think we have discipline on capital allocation. We're committed to dividend growth, the buyback that
we talked about. But if we saw unique value in the marketplace like we did with Avio, we would do transactions like
that.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great. That makes lots of sense. And then, since we have Rod on the call today, I would love
to hear from you about if you could frame for us how much of the portfolio do you have in place today? The whole idea
that GE was able to take a lot of the proceeds from NBC and very quickly add some strategic assets into Oil & Gas and
then you would stop and see how's the portfolio, where are the gaps? And from your perspective, how much of your
portfolio do you have today in order to be effective? Do you have half? Do you have three quarters? I'm not asking
specific gaps but maybe just frame for us how complete the portfolio is?
<A - Rod Christie>: Sure. I think when I look at the portfolio that we have today for Subsea, we feel very good about
it. We can compete pretty much anywhere that we choose to. I think what you've seen over the last six months around
us moving more into the Subsea Power & Processing really gives you an idea of the breadth that we can bring from GE
broadly. So Power Conversion, Turbomachinery, Water, realize it's a step into those spaces.
So at this point in time, I feel very good about where we are and anything going forward is really a discussion about
internal versus external with a bit more scale. So it's really about timing. So very similar to what Jeff had talked about
with if you see something that looks very attractive to us then potentially, but we don't feel like there's any major miss
at this point in time.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Good. Can you maybe just talk about – you talked about the 50 bps continuing throughout the
year. Anything you guys have – I guess every company has become kind of seasonal with bigger quarters in the back
half of the year. Anything kind of lumpy in the second quarter that we need to be aware of whether it's timing of some
of these advanced gas paths stuff or Wind that we have to consider when thinking about the second quarter?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah. I don't think so, Steve. I don't think Jeff said he was carrying the 50 basis points all
year but thank you for that. We'll have slightly higher restructuring charges in the second quarter. I said we're still on
track for the $1 billion to $1.5 billion and we're going to spend 60% of that spend in the first half of year. So the second
quarter will be a little bit bigger than the first quarter.
We will ship more GEnx engines in the second quarter than we shipped in the first quarter. But other than that not a lot
of – I did mention that we're working on one disposition. Not sure whether that's going to be second or third quarter
quite yet but not that big a deal. So other than that, I don't have a lot of other items to call out for you.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then just on the organic growth calc, can we get the contribution from the deals and
then forex or the negative from forex for the quarter – total deals, revenue contribution and then forex? I know they're
in the back of the supplement or whatever or on the press release but just the data.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, sure, Steve. So reported revenue up 8%. Acquisitions added 2 points. Dispositions
were kind of 1.4 point impact and then foreign exchange was 0.5 point. And that's how you go from 8% to 8%.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So two...
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then the – all right. That's great. Thanks.

The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Jeff. How are you doing?
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: I'm doing great. And you?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Just a question on the Industrial balance sheet, I guess dovetailing with – maybe opening the
aperture a little bit on deals. You did do the $3 billion debt raise on the Industrial balance sheet. How would you size
that relative to the capacity that you have, right? You teased us a little bit in December with some juice there. Is the $3
billion the number or is it something larger than that?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: The $3 billion was in the context of the capital allocation plan that we put together for
2014 and we saw the first quarter where markets were very opportunistic. We issued the $3 billion. We were
immensely oversubscribed and were very pleased with the rates that we took the $3 billion at well inside on an after-tax
basis – our dividend yield. But that's how we sized it within the context of our capital allocation game plan for the year.
We're constantly reevaluating the capital allocation game plan with the team and the board and we'll continue to do
that.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: But that's roughly kind of the comfortable number relative to the cost commitments to capital
and everything?

<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, no. It's the relevant comfortable number within the context of the capital allocation
plan we pulled together for the year.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. And then can you just size for us the gains that you had in CLL and Energy Financial
Services?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, so CLL, we did sell about 18,000 boxcars per diems, meaning daily rental boxcars
in the quarter that was worth a little north of $100 million. We did sell some private equity investments that we do
reasonably routinely and there's a little bit of Volcker driven the first quarter. That was a much smaller gain.
And then Energy Finance, it's pretty routine for us. We had about I don't know – $150 million of gains associated with
properties that we sold in Energy Finance in the first quarter.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great. Thank you very much.

The next question is from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Good morning, guys. Jeff, could we flesh out a little bit of the playbook for the Energy
Management business. It looks like you guys made a leadership change there. How are you thinking about really just
the portfolio and maybe, as Jeff Bornstein, you've gotten into further the restructuring how that maybe complements
that segment or your focus on it? Just something that might provide us a little bit more color.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: John, here's the way I'd look at it. First, from a technical standpoint there are the pieces of
the Energy Management business that are great fits for the rest of the company like Power Conversion. As Rod said,
that's a great complement to Oil & Gas and some of the other things we're doing. So technically, these are industries we
understand and can compete in.
Our relevant competitors have margin rates that are 10% plus. Some of that's scale and some of that's our own
complexity. What Jeff Bornstein said today is that we're committed to restructure and that's going to provide some big
margin lift in that business. And then I just think we can execute better. Mark Begor is a guy that's well known inside
the company of being a great recruiter and an extremely experienced operator turnaround guy. And he's in place and
we're hiring people from the industry and my intent is to run this business and make it better and make it accretive to
investors and drive earnings in it.
Could there be a couple segments in there that aren't long-term fits for GE? Could be but we'll sort that out and be very
tough-minded about it. But this segment can do better than what you're seeing right now and that's our commitment to
you is to make it better both from a cost standpoint and from a market standpoint.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So just on that front, I'd just add that actually you can't see it in the results yet. It's getting
eaten up in operations but they are making progress in restructuring. We had closer to $25 million of benefits in
restructuring in the first quarter and we expect that to accelerate throughout the year. But there is some progress here.
Our manufacturing delinquencies are down 50% versus year-end and so we are making progress. I completely
understand you can't see it in the results yet, but our expectation is that this business is going to improve dramatically
from an operating earnings perspective over the balance of the year.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. That was my other part of the question is so sequential improvement and it sounds like,
Jeff, there's no reason this business can't be running a double-digit margins. Is that fair?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Unless everybody – I think, John, everybody else, unlike our other businesses where our
margins were ahead of our peers, this is one where we trail our peers and we can do better.

<Q - John G. Inch>: Can I just ask about the Oil & Gas business for a second? There's kind of a broad-level concern
in the industry about flattish CapEx budgets for the integrateds and, obviously, just the global economy's still not
particularly helpful. Price of oil doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Maybe you can provide a little bit more color,
given that you featured Oil & Gas on the call. How does that context of these big integrated companies with flat, if not
even maybe declining CapEx budgets, how does that dovetail with your own business? And why is your own business
either more or less impervious to that?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Rod, why don't you take a crack?
<A - Rod Christie>: Sure. And I'm going to talk specifically about what I'm seeing in subsea today. Really what I see
is a lot more front-end engagement so the customers that I'm talking to aren't really looking at dialing back the number
of projects. They're looking at how do they get better capital efficiency. So we see more front-end engagement around
technology, the selection of that technology, configuration and how can we deploy with less risks, shorter cycle and
effectively at a lower cost.
So in many cases, what I thought about with the structuring our product really plays to that. We've taken cycle out,
which obviously means is there's a shorter carrying period for any capital investments in the subsea area from my
perspective. So I think most of the customers are looking to continue to drive as many of the projects as they can is
making it much easier for us from the point of view of actually early engagement, early dialogue, early engineering so
we can take more risk out.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: John, I'd add to that reinforcement of the way we build our Oil & Gas business by really
invest very specific segments that have faster growth rates than the industry itself. So things like Subsea,
Turbomachinery and the LNG train, some of our downstream technologies. We really are in the places where there's
going to be a lot of capital continue to be spent.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. So looking at Shell's CapEx deployment's not really the correct proxy, in other words, is
what you're saying.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Exactly. Yeah.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Got it. Thanks very much.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great, John. Thanks.

The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. I just had a couple of questions on the margin bridge. I think firstly, value gap was
maybe about $100 million tailwind in Q1. I just wanted to check that. And back in January you talked about a $200
million tailwind for the year in value gap. Is that still the case or have you kind of updated those assumptions?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, I think that's what we guided at year-end and we expected the value gap for the year
to be $100 million to $200 million. In the quarter, you're not too far off the mark here in terms of value gap. I think
what you've got to bear in mind is within our value gap this quarter, Power & Water was negative but not
extraordinarily negative and we expect price particularly in Thermal to be much tougher as we work through the
backlog for the balance of the year. So you're correct. The framework was up to $200 million and you're not far off the
mark on the impact in the quarter.

<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Okay. And then just on the mix effect, can you just remind us I guess what the view is
now on wind deliveries for the year and how much more those are kind of ramping up in the back half?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, so no change on the framework that I give you at year-end on wind deliveries. I said
that we'd do about 3,000 units and that's still what we expect to do. In terms of first half/second half, it's a little bit
heavier weighted to the second half of the year. We'll do about 1,800 units of those 3,000 units in the third and fourth
quarter.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks. And lastly, just quickly, and I guess for Jeff Immelt, on the divestments
in Industrial, you talk little bit about that in the slides. Also in the Annual Report there was some kind of commitment
or comment around targeting a minimum 10% margin for the Industrial businesses. I just wondered sort of was that
equipment plus service combined, and what the timeframe for that 10% minimum threshold was because I guess you
have some businesses that have never been at 10%.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Julian, what I would focus on is the $4 billion number. I think it's our expectation that we're
more active on the divestiture front this year and kind of leave it at that. We continue to be tough-minded around the
portfolio and I would expect our divestitures to be a little bit more active this year than they were last.

The next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning, everybody.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey, just, Rod, while I've got you here and I really appreciate the focus in on the
business unit during the call. I guess one of the primary debates in around subsea is that production tree order trend's
starting to rise again in 2015 and you addressed your mix benefit but this emerging capital discipline by the majors, this
is a real question of even in those more attractive sub-segments, to what extent do you think that risks the growth? And
to what extent also are you seeing the outlook for production tree pricing deteriorate in any way?
<A - Rod Christie>: I mean, if you look at the forecast this year for trees, overall globally it's down but I mean you
have to look at the mix between Brazil and the rest of the world. So Brazil was a large buy for a large commitment
made for trees in 2013. So the rest of world demand actually increases slightly year-over-year and then you see the total
demand back up again or forecast to go back up again in 2015.
The other thing that you'll really see is the projects have got larger so things have got lumpier. You look at internal
number of projects that are going for development into the future. There's less projects but more tree count per project.
So I think again the early engagement pre-FEED activities and FEED activities are really going to be critical to driving
some of the efficiency in this area from capital deployment.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And the pricing, outlook for pricing?
<A - Rod Christie>: I think we still feel that pricing, the demand for the future is still increasing so it's really about
delivery cycle at this point in time.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. On healthcare, the pricing in healthcare, I guess, Jeff, how should we think about
this? Do you see this as any kind of structural change in the industry, is this a function in the Americas, in North
America of the transition we're all going through in hospitals? I mean can you maybe give us some color on how we
should sort of think about this?

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes, Steve, I think it's a good question. I'd say, first, if you look outside the U.S., the
markets are all normal with Europe bouncing back and the growth markets still pretty strong. I think it's too soon to say
on just the impact of the Affordable Care Act. There's just so damn much going on in the U.S. healthcare market right
now. We're kind of thinking about the next couple of years as being flat to up slightly. So we're not really thinking
much about robust growth, and more industry consolidation of hospital systems, more integration between insurers and
hospitals so there's just a ton going on in the industry.
At the same time, when you launch a new product like the Revolution CT like we're launching in the second quarter,
it's going to build a huge backlog. It's going to have positive growth. And so, with all the stuff that's going on in the
industry, when you have new technology you still can differentiate yourself and you still get good growth and good
margins. So I think we're just going to kind of wait and see and watch how the industry evolves.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And can I just sneak one in for Jeff Bornstein or maybe it's two, I suppose, but this
tax rate that we've got this quarter, should we think about that as sort of more normalized now? And also with the
orders, have those Algerian orders come through yet in the official ordered numbers?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, so the tax rate, I think what I said was we still expect the Industrial tax rate to be
about 20% and we still expect the GE Capital tax rate to be single digits in the year. So I don't think our view of taxes
has changed at all for the total year. The Algerian units on the mega deal are in our orders book.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And I think, Steve, if you look at heavy-duty gas turbine orders, I think we said in December
about $1.25 billion or something like that.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Yeah.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think we're tracking at least to that. This is a slightly improving market is what I would
say, broadly speaking.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I want to clean one thing up before we move on to the next question. So on Energy
Finance, I think Jeff Sprague asked me on gains in Energy Finance. I think I said $150 million. It was $120 million.
That's about $60 million higher year-over-year and that was partly offset by about $100 million of increased higher
impairments this year versus last year. So I just want to make sure that's clear.
<A - Matthew G. Cribbins>: Okay. We know everyone has a busy morning. Ellen, why don't we take one more
question?
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for fitting me in. Hey, guys. So, Jeff, you mentioned the H Frame,
which is obviously a very important product. You mentioned two commitments. Were they U.S. commitments? And
then dovetailed on the back of your comments about a gradually improving market, what are you seeing in the U.S.
right now in terms of the front log for 2015 and 2016?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So the answer I think to the first question is no. And the answer to the second question I
think is just a slow improvement in the U.S. starting with peakers and we haven't seen big demand for [ph] a base of
units (1:00:07) yet but a ton more interest in the U.S. than we've seen in the last few years is the way I would describe
it, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Okay. Great. So moving on to GECAS, assets are down by about 10% from early last year and
I'm wondering what do you think is the right level for assets in GECAS? Is there a longer tail of equalization within
GECAS going forward?

<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: The GECAS business order of magnitude is roughly the size within the context of GE
Capital and the company that it's probably going to be long-term, plus or minus. They'll continue to originate. They'll
continue to grow. I talked about their volume in the first quarter being very strong year-over-year at very attractive
returns. So they'll continue to be very active and write new business. At the same time, they'll continue to prune the
portfolio they have and that allows them – that creates the capacity for them to continue to be in the market and write
volume. Assets year-over-year I think are flat for GECAS.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: I think they're down 8% year-over-year. But I can check that.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: [indiscernible] (01:01:24)
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And then just, Jeff, on the – you mentioned $1.8 billion run rate for GE Capital per quarter going
forward. That seems to be slightly above the $7 billion placed order for the year.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Do you think there's more [indiscernible] (01:01:43) $7 billion at this stage?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: No, I think we're still in that $7 billion framework. You've got a number of items to go
here where we still plan on doing the initial IPO of retail so you lose 20% of those earnings. We'll still continue to
invest in that business to create the standalone capability around risk and governance, so that will come at some cost.
We'll still do the GECAS [ph] in permits (01:02:11) here in third quarter. So I think that we're still focused on the $7
billion framework that Keith shared with you in November.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Understood. Thanks very much.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Okay. Thanks, everybody.
