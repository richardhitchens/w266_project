Thank you, Dana. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, a great start to the year, with
solid organic sales growth of 9%. Combined with the benefit of strong operating leverage on the higher sales, UTC
delivered earnings per share growth of 19%. Cash generation was also strong and finally, as expected, order trends
continued to improve across UTC, including now much of our late-cycle businesses.
As we look across the globe, we see end markets are improving, much as we had expected back in December. In the
U.S., the recent employment and consumer spending data are encouraging signs of further recovery, while Europe
generally remains stable, in spite of the continuing sovereign debt concerns. Of course, emerging markets continue to
lead worldwide economic growth and UTC's businesses are capitalizing on this opportunity. There are always, of
course, concerns.
Biggest threats we see on the horizon are, first and foremost, commodity inflation, especially higher oil prices.
Secondly, the emerging supply chain disruptions caused by the tragedy in Japan are a potential growing issue. While
we're confident in Japan's resilience and ability to recover, there likely will be some short-term supply chain disruptions
in our businesses. The biggest area we continue to monitor closely is electronics, micro processors, capacitors and other
such components, which go into many of our products across our business units and deeply into the supply chain at
second and third tier suppliers.
We continue to work with our suppliers in securing available inventory and alternative sources and we expect that the
impact of disruptions, if any, will only be felt in the back half of the year. But let me stress all of this is manageable
within the scope of our current guidance.
All right, notwithstanding these potential overhangs, the stronger than expected performance in Carrier short-cycle
businesses and improving order rates in both our long and short-cycle businesses gives us confidence to increase our
full-year outlook. We now expect 2011 earnings per share to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.40. That's up $0.05, at both
the top and bottom ends of the prior range, or 11% to 14% EPS growth. We also expect sales of $57 billion at the high
end of our previous range of $56 billion to $57 billion. So that's sales growth of 5% year-over-year.
Before we start with the first quarter results, just a reminder that we'll talk to the segment results adjusted for
restructuring and one-time items, as we usually do. Okay, on slide 2, in the quarter, sales were up 11% from prior year
with organic growth of 9%. Importantly, five of the six businesses saw organic sales growth. Carrier and Sikorsky led
the way with 18% and 15%, respectively. While the strong growth is partially due to a tough first quarter last year, it's
also evidence of a broader recovery in our end markets. We are seeing a strong rebound in our short-cycle businesses,
such as Carrier's Transicold and U.S. Residential HVAC, as well as our commercial aero aftermarket.
Carrier's U.S. Residential gas furnace and split shipments were up mid-teens in the quarter, despite continuing
weakness in the U.S. housing segment. Our longer-cycle businesses are also gaining traction, as expected, with growth
in commercial aero OEM, global commercial HVAC at Carrier, as well as Fire & Security. Importantly, Otis' new
equipment sales, which are still lagging, but the solid order trends give us confidence in the sales recovery in the back
half of the year.
Total segment operating profit increased 15%. That's even with higher E&D of $88 million, as the businesses continue
to execute on their growth strategies. Most significantly, at Pratt Whitney, as it advances multiple development
programs of the geared triple-band technology. Segment operating margin expanded 80 basis points in the quarter.
Carrier led the way, once again, with margin expansion of 530 basis points to a record of 11.7%, reflecting exceptional
conversion on its 18% organic sales growth.
Earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.11. That's up 19%. Restructuring costs in the quarter were $31 million,
or $0.02, compared $67 million, or $0.05, in last year's first quarter. Excluding restructuring costs in both quarters,
earnings per share increased 15%. Foreign currency was a $0.01 benefit to EPS. In the quarter, free cash flow was
117% of net income, even as inventory grew significantly in the quarter in support of the robust organic sales growth.
Share repurchase in the quarter was $750 million, a strong start to this year's program. And we also increased the
dividend 13% last week, another sign of confidence in our outlook, as well as our commitment to delivering consistent
shareowner returns.

Okay, on to slide 3, first quarter order rates, first quarter order rates remain strong and this is what gives us confidence
in our 2011 sales outlook. In Aerospace, first quarter commercial spares orders at Pratt Whitney and Hamilton
Sunstrand were up 33% and 23%, respectively. At constant currency, Otis' new equipment orders grew 14% in the
quarter and Carrier's global commercial HVAC new equipment orders were up 24%, further evidence that end markets
are indeed recovering.
Emerging markets remain solid and first quarter BRIC country orders for our commercial companies grew just under
20%, so excellent quarter of solid sales earnings growth, strong cash flow and an improved end market environment.
I'll come back and talk a little bit about the full year, but for now, let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the
business unit details.
Akhil Johri
Thanks, Greg. Turning to slide 4, Otis delivered a solid quarter, with profits up 4% on sales growth of 2%. Operating
margins expanded 50 basis points to 22.8%. At constant currency, profits increased 3% on flat sales from continued
growth in service.
New equipment sales were down 6% at constant currency, driven by declines in North America and Europe. China new
equipment and aftermarket sales continued to grow. Service sales were also up globally, with continuing growth in
contractual maintenance and improving repair volume.
New equipment orders continued to improve, up 14% at constant currency with double-digit growth in North America,
Europe and China, even as pricing remains under pressure in most markets. For the year, Otis expects to see strong new
equipment growth in emerging markets, led by China, along with improvement in the U.S. and Northern Europe.
Markets in Southern Europe are expected to remain flat. Guidance for the full year remains unchanged, with profits
expected to grow approximately $150 million.
Turning to Carrier on slide 5, following the very strong order rate experience late in Q4 and into Q1, Carrier posted an
exceptionally strong first quarter. Profits were up $167 million on 12% higher sales, resulting in a record Q1 margin of
11.7%, up 530 basis points from prior year.
As Greg said, organic sales growth was 18%. Refrigerated container shipments in Q1 were at a record level
contributing to 60% plus organic growth at Transicold. We also saw North America residential distributors restocking
in Q1, resulting in shipments of residential systems up in the mid-teens.
Earnings growth was driven by strong conversion on sales growth. The absence of a $20 million charge from last year
first quarter related to portfolio transformation items and another $20 million earnings improvement in the Japanese
joint venture from activity prior to the earthquake and the tsunami.
The ramp-up in Carrier short-cycle businesses in Q1 was truly extraordinary and we expect a return to more normal
growth in the balance of the year, particularly the second half. Given Carrier's first quarter performance, we are
increasing Carrier's profit growth guidance for the year to $250 million plus, from $175 million previously. We now
expect Carrier's organic sales growth to be up nearly double-digit for the year.
UTC Fire & Security delivered operating margin expansion of 100 basis points in the quarter on 15% higher sales.
Organic sales were up about 3%, with product businesses up mid-single-digits, Asia up double-digit and the other
regional service and install businesses flattish. Acquisitions from two months of GE Security contributed
approximately 10 percentage points of sales growth. First quarter orders also grew organically 3%. Importantly, orders
in the service and install businesses were up mid-single-digits in all regions, except the UK.
Backlog is up organically 12% year-over-year and 7% from the beginning of the year. Operating profit in the quarter
grew 27%, 24% at cost and currency. The profit growth was largely driven by higher volume and the GE Security
acquisition. A gain from the sale of the UK guarding business also contributed about one-third of the profit increase.
For the full year, we continue to expect sales to be up high single-digits and operating profit up approximately $175

million.
Turning to aerospace businesses on slide 7, at Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 9%, driven primarily by higher overall
aftermarket sales. Higher engine sales at Pratt Canada were more than offset by lower military engine shipments and
development revenues. Large commercial engine spares sales were more than 30% higher than the first quarter of 2010
and in line with the expected sales for 2011.
Operating profit was up 3% in the quarter. The benefits from net higher sales and restructuring savings were partially
offset by a $75 million increase in Pratt's E&D. Also in the quarter, a gain from the sale of a minority equity position in
a venture offset higher pension costs.
Operating margin for the quarter was 15.3%, down 100 basis points year-over-year. Excluding E&D, operating margin
was up about 100 basis points. For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney operating profit to be down $50
million on flattish sales.
In the quarter, Hamilton Sunstrand operating profit grew 11% on 9% higher sales. Industrial and aerospace aftermarket
sales were up low teens, while aero OEM sales were up mid-single-digit. Commercial spares sales and orders were both
up over 20% versus last year. Book-to-bill was slightly above 1% and the industrial orders increased mid-single-digit.
Profit growth in the quarter reflects the benefit of increased sales, partially offset by higher E&D. Operating margin for
the quarter was 17.1%, up 30 basis points. For the full year, we continue to expect Hamilton Sunstrand's operating
profit to be up about $100 million and the sales up mid-single-digit.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide 9, operating profits dropped by 2% on 16% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky
shipped a total of 58 large aircraft, 5 more than the first quarter of last year. 51 aircraft were based on military
platforms and seven commercial. High sales in the quarter were driven by increased international development aircraft,
including the first Canadian Maritime helicopter and higher aftermarket volumes, partially offset by fewer S-92
deliveries.
Operating profit was down slightly, as the benefit from higher U.S. government shipments was more than offset by
losses from international development aircraft and the impact from fewer S-92 deliveries. For the year, we continue to
expect profit growth of approximately $100 million on sales growth in mid-single-digits.
With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay, thank you Akhil. We're on slide 10 now for those of you following along. So a strong quarter, solid top-line,
margin expansion, earnings growth and cash flow, as Louis would say, truly UTC-style execution. In addition to the
solid financial performance, we had some other notable accomplishments in the quarter.
Sikorsky was awarded the prestigious Collier Trophy for its achievement on the X2 Technology demonstrator program.
Pratt & Whitney's GTF continues to be a game changer and has already won firm orders for over 450 engines on the
A320/NEO program. That comes from industry leaders Lufthansa and ILFC, as well as the largest order to date for 150
firm and 30 options from IndiGo Airlines.
On the commercial side, Carrier continues to drive its portfolio transformation agenda towards completion. They
recently announced a joint venture with Watsco for the Residential HVAC distribution in the Northeastern U.S.
Importantly, this completes the transformation of Carrier's U.S. distribution footprint.
All right, let's talk about the full year. As I said before, we're very confident in our improved outlook, of $5.25 to $5.40
on sales of $57 billion, but of course, we will always remain cautious because of some uncertainties that are out there.
As I previously mentioned, the impact from Japan is uncertain. We're closely monitoring, working with the supply
chain and don't expect this to be a significant headwind. Also, as you know, high oil prices significantly impact our
airline customers. While the airlines have maintained pricing and capacity discipline, sustained high oil prices will
likely dampen profitability. As a result, could lead to reduced capacity and lower aftermarket demand in the back half

of the year.
Some airlines have already announced slower capacity growth for the later part of this year. That said, as this quarter's
results show, commercial aero aftermarket demand remains robust, but it is a short-cycle business and compares will
get tougher in the back half of the year. On the other hand, foreign currency could be a potential upside to our outlook,
if exchange rates remain at current levels.
Our current guidance of $5.25 to $5.40 still assumes that the euro will be about 1.35 for the year. If the euro average
holds at 1.40 for the remainder of this year, that represents upside of $50 million in pre-tax profits, which is not yet
reflected in our guidance. This is prudent, we think, as uncertainties of the sovereign debt crisis play out every day. As
far as the other elements of our 2011 guidance, we still expect restructuring to be $150 million to $200 million for the
year and equal to one-time gains, both in the first half and for the full year.
For E&D, we continue to expect full year to be up $200 million to $225 million, but this could come under some
pressure as we execute on numerous programs and especially in light of Airbus' recent decision to accelerate the
A320/NEO program by six months. The effective tax rate for the quarter is still anticipated to be around 30.5% with a
second quarter rate of around 29%. Now that's down from the 32.5% we saw in the first quarter. As always, we expect
free cash flow to equal or exceed net income. We still forecast share repurchase of $2.5 billion and acquisition spend of
$1.5 billion for the year.
So the world has improved, but the recent shocks from Japan and the Middle East will test the resilience of this
recovery. As always, we remain cautious but confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments. We are focused on
the top-line and we continue to execute our strategies to capitalize on recovery markets, as well as our strong presence
in emerging and growth markets. I think it's important we also have a very strong product pipeline across the
businesses with programs like the 787, the geared turbo fan and the Joint Strike Fighter, which will drive solid
long-term growth.
We're well positioned to benefit from top-line growth. At the high end of our guidance range, 2011 earnings per share
would up 10% from our 2008 peak of $4.90 and that comes on 4% lower sales from 2008, while in addition, $200
million of higher E&D this year than 2008. I think all of that is strong evidence that the tough actions taken over the
last three years to reduce our structural costs are indeed paying off.
In closing, the seasoned management team is committed to driving long-term growth, both on the top and bottom-line.
We're confident in the guidance and generating sustained double-digit earnings growth well into the future.
With that, let's open up the call for questions
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Deane Dray with Citi.
<Q - Deane M. Dray CFA, MBA>: Morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray CFA, MBA>: Hey, Greg, was hoping you could comment on the price cost dynamics in the
quarter. I saw some earlier comments this morning that you made that gross commodity costs looking at $250 million.
Where are you on pricing? And I have some follow-ups on that, too, please?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, we saw about $50 million of commodity headwind in the quarter. As you know, I
think at Carrier, we raised prices early in February. So far, those prices seem to be sticking. But I think for the full year,
we still expect the commodity -- gross commodity headwind to be about $250 million, with about $100 million of
pricing to offset that. So still a headwind out there in the guidance for really the back half of the year. Call it another

$100 million on top of the $50 million we saw in the first quarter. On top of that, there's probably another $75 million
of energy headwind from the higher oil prices. Again, that's all back half of the year here.
<Q - Deane M. Dray CFA, MBA>: How about just specifically in at Carrier and the price increases that you think you
can put through? Just remind us of – on a percent basis, how much you put through. Maybe some sense of the elasticity
and how much more room on the upside on pricing might you have?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, we put through price increases. I think we announced them back in the fourth quarter
that were effective early February of about 2% to 6% on the residential side. And those prices seem to be sticking. And
again, I think with commodities holding about where they are, copper in that $4.20 to $4.30, we would expect that most
of our competition probably has the same price pressure that we do.
I'd also say that we've got pricing pressure on the transport refrigeration business. I think, especially at Transicold,
pricing remains difficult. But with the market recovering and the fixed costs coming out, I think you see good margin
and good conversions for that.
<Q - Deane M. Dray CFA, MBA>: Great. And just one specific question on the aero aftermarket. We heard that some
carriers could be restocking as some insurance against their own supply chains disruptions. Have you seen any signs of
that? And might there have been a benefit this quarter from that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We have not seen any evidence of restocking. You look at the order rate growth at Pratt this
year, 33%. That's off of a pretty easy compare from last year's first quarter. And it's realty in line, if you think about the
overall sales level, about in line with what we expect for the full year. So I wouldn't expect 33% increases during the
course of the year. But there might be some upside here if there is some restocking. But so far, we really haven't seen it,
either at Pratt or at Hamilton.
<Q - Deane M. Dray CFA, MBA>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Deane.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Yeah. Good morning, Greg.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Ron.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: When you look at the guidance that the company issued today for the organic growth for the
rest of the year, given the order activity in the first quarter and was it 9% organic growth in the quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Right.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Doesn't it seem like that's pretty darn conservative for the second half of the year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, I think, again, you're not going to see probably the same level of growth during the
back half of the year as you're going to see in the front half of the year just because the compares get tougher. You'll
recall we started to see an acceleration of organic growth throughout the year last year. And so if you think about we're
going to be up 5% total this year, that's the guidance.
It would indicate a slowing growth rate at the back half of the year. And again, I wouldn't expect to see 18% growth out
of Carrier organically in the next couple of quarters. It'll probably be more in the mid-single-digit range as we look
forward, but -- and we could be surprised on the upside. I think the important thing is, as Louie has been promising
since this recovery started, if we do see good news on the top-line, you're going to see it on the bottom-line. And that's
really the message here this -- with the $5.40 at the top end.

<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay. And then maybe a capital deployment question. In the quarter, you bought back I
guess, what, $750 million worth of shares?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Right.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: When we think about that for the rest of the year, what's your view on share buybacks and I
know you probably can't say a heck of a lot about it, but there's all this speculation floating around Tyco. So maybe if I
could throw out just the broad M&A question and what you're thinking there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah I think, again, the place holders are still out there of $2.5 billion for share buyback and
$1.5 billion for M&A for the year. In the quarter, we only did about $100 million of M&A, just some very small deals.
And M&A remains elusive in terms of some of these bigger deals that we have been chasing. So we still feel good
about the $2.5 billion. You can see, obviously, the run rate on the first quarter share buyback would be more like $3
billion. I expect if we don't spend the money on M&A, just like we've done in prior years, you'll see more on share
buyback. So we'll see how the year progresses. And as for specific deals I think you guys all know, I really can't
comment on anything specific to anything -- any of those potentials deals.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: But what's the appetite for a big deal? I mean, meaning greater than $8 billion or something?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, obviously, we're always open to deals that make sense for the shareowners, but having
said that, it has to be a deal that makes sense. It's got to be something that's strategic. We don't need to do a big deal. I
would tell you, Ron. We've been saying that for a couple of years. We love the deals like GE Security. We love deals
that fit in the core. A big deal, it's -- they're tough to do. You need willing buyers and willing sellers. And it really has
to be the right price to make sure that we enrich our shareowners as much as we're going to enrich their shareowners.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan CFA>: Morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan CFA>: Hey, a couple of questions on Carrier, one, on the commercial HVAC order
strength, can you give us a little feel geographically in terms of how that played out?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure, Shannon. I think the strength we saw was across the geographies. Europe and America were
both up mid-teens and Asia was much stronger than the average. So Asia was closer to 40%.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan CFA>: Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the price increase on the resi side, I mean,
how did the months play out for the year? And did you see any pre-buy and then fall-back or that kind of thing? How
did the – how did things play out through the quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: As we entered the quarter, I think we made this comment back in January, that the
inventories out in the channel were at really historically low levels. And so we did see some bigger restocking orders
January, February, slowed down a little bit in March, but still a pretty solid quarter. So it's – yeah, I think as we look at
channel inventories today, still relatively low for this time of the year. So we expect, again, a pretty good second
quarter at Carrier on the res side.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan CFA>: And are there any further price increases planned?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, at this point, I don't believe there's anything out there. But it's one of those things that
you'll just have to see what happens to commodity prices in the market and try and stay in front of those things.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan CFA>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

And we'll go next to Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Joe, are you there?
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol III>: Can you hear me?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Now I can.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol III>: Sorry. I had the mute button pushed here. It's early on the West Coast. Good morning. On
Japan, Greg, just a little more color there. I'm wondering, I mean you already told us what types of things are – you
anticipate will be in short supply. I'm just wondering in which segments those might fall into? And then more
specifically, in aerospace, are there the kind of things that are not replaceable due to certification concerns? Or do you
think that much of what you're going to be missing you'll be able to source somewhere else?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Specifically on the aero side, we had a little bit of a scare because, obviously, we've got
some partners on the V2500 that – where their factories and sub tier suppliers suffered some damage. But we think
we've got workarounds. We're working actively with those suppliers and don't see any big re-qualification efforts on
that, may push an engine or two out a month or two, but nothing that's dramatic.
The bigger concern, as I said in the script, is the electronics. 40% of the world's flash memory comes out of Japan and,
as well as the capacitors, transistors and things. And we use those on a lot of different products from Carrier's controls
to the F&S smoke and CO detectors that we make. We're working through that. So far, it looks like we've got good
visibility to it. But it's the second and third tier suppliers that we still worry about. I mean, our first tier suppliers, we're
all over that.
We've got to make sure that those suppliers are all over their suppliers and that we don't end up with a surprise. But I
think the system works pretty well. We've got 1,500 key suppliers out there, 27,000 in total and we're working through
that process every day, but so far, not a big deal.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol III>: Okay. And then secondly, just a follow-up on the organic growth, certainly it makes sense
what you're saying and Q1 was easily the low last year for your organic growth. It was negative and the rest of the year
was positive and it got fairly positive towards the end of the year. So the comps are going to get tougher. But if you go
back a few years ago, your organic growth across the company was pretty consistently for a few years in the higher
single-digits and certainly the order numbers you're showing us are way above single-digits. Again, off easy comps.
But I'm just wondering, if you could put this into context, what's the opportunity really to keep this into -- in the higher
single-digits, even if it slows a little bit in the back half of the year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think we talked about trying to grow sales here, kind of 2X world GDP, 6% to 9%. And
that is the long-term goal. I would tell you that probably the best metric to point out to is just look at our top-line today
and look at the markets that we play in. We are not at peak in any of those markets, save perhaps the container
transportation business at Carrier, but only on the container side. So the $59 billion of sales we had a couple of years
ago, there's still runway to get to that and beyond as these markets recover. So I'm still cautiously optimistic you're
going to see growth, some this year and even more into next year as all these markets recover, especially on the
commercial construction side in the U.S. and in Europe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol III>: Okay. So you are saying that there could be upside to your number then? Again, I'm just
trying to gauge here the confidence level that – when you guys are talking about organic growth, looking the rest of this
year and into next year, how – what are the chances you think that we're getting back into that sweet spot we were in
four or five years ago?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, I'm not sure we're ever going to be in the sweet spot we were in four and five years
ago, although debt is still cheap. And that's what caused the bubble the last time. So there certainly could be some of
that impact this time. I think the good news is going to come on commercial construction. We're seeing that at F&S.
Their order rates are improving. We're seeing it especially at Otis, which, as you know, the orders have been down. But
we'll get to the 2012 guidance maybe in another couple of months here, but for now, I think we're confident in this year
and in the future. We're going to drive solid double-digit growth next year and beyond.

And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Nigel Coe CFA>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe CFA>: I don't want to beat the organic growth horse to death, but the fall off into the 3% or 4% range
from 3Q to 4Q compared to 1Q at 9%; obviously, you're putting in a big hedge in terms of Japan or – and on
profitability. What concerns you most of those two possibilities? Is it the high oil price? Or is it maybe some significant
supply chain shortages?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think it's actually the date on the calendar that concerns me most. It's early. Carrier's got its
biggest selling season ahead of it. It's got the second and third quarter. That's when the U.S. Residential business, we'll
know whether or not we're going to see the kind of growth continue that we saw in the first quarter. The same I think
with the commercial airlines. I think the biggest concern we have is what happens with oil prices. Typically, when we
see a spike in oil prices, it's six to nine months before it drives a change in buying behavior at the airlines. And so those
are the kind of – really the two big things, oh, maybe three: it's early, Carrier's two biggest quarters are coming and you
got the high oil prices. But look, we're confident in the numbers. We're going to get there and there may be upside.
<Q - Nigel Coe CFA>: And obviously, you [ph] negotiated (31:22) the commitment to delivering the upside of
revenues to earnings. You've said restructuring will be matched by gains, but what about E&D? It sounds like there
could be an upside bias to E&D in the second half of the year. Could you use some good news on revenues to maybe
accelerate some of those programs?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, clearly there is pressure at Pratt to spend more on these programs. They've got the C
Series. They've got the MRJ. They've got the [indiscernible] (31:45) and they've got this NEO program which is, I
mean, again, it's going gangbusters, right. Orders are outstanding. Everybody is exited. Airbus wants to accelerate the
program. So all of that means they want to spend more. And quite frankly, we may well accelerate some of that
investment into the back half of the year just to try and get ahead of it. The issue right now is just hiring enough good
engineers here in the States to meet the demand.
<Q - Nigel Coe CFA>: Right. And then just finally on Carrier margins, stunning performance, anything in there that
may be not sustainable going forward? Because when I look at 1Q margins, normally two, three points weaker than 2Q,
3Q, implies this year could be in the 12%, 13% range. How do I think about that? I mean, anything in this quarter that I
should be backing out?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, there's a couple of things in there. And let me just say I think we're highly confident in
12% by '12 with Carrier. But the first quarter did have about $40 million of, I'll call it, unusual items. Last year's first
quarter, I think Akhil said this in the script, that we had about $20 million from the portfolio transformation, costs that
came through their segment that we didn't back out. We also this year in the first quarter had about $20 million of
income from our Japanese joint venture with Toshiba. And again, given what's going on in Japan, we wouldn't expect
that the good news we saw in the first quarter is going to repeat. So of that growth, so there's probably $40 million

that's not going to repeat.
<A - Akhil Johri>: One other point item for consideration is the – you all know that Transicold is a good business for
Carrier and has generally higher margins than average; and the growth rate there was over 60% organically. And if you
assume that's not going to repeat every quarter, which I think is a reasonable assumption, then obviously, that will have
a downward pressure on the margins going forward, as well.
<Q - Nigel Coe CFA>: Yeah, [ph] when we consider that, we'll take off 40% in the second quarter (33:33). Okay.
Thanks a lot. Bye.

And we'll go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi Rubel.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: First question, just to change and talk about Pratt restructuring and cost take-outs and so on.
I mean, that's also very impressive considering the higher R&D. Could you talk a little bit about what you've been
doing in order to improve the manufacturing base there? And then specifically address how you're using that to drive
out costs on the F135?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think there's a couple of things that Dave Hess and team have been doing for the last couple
of years, have taken a lot of structural costs out of that business. And for this year, we would expect about $75 million
of restructuring benefits to flow through. On top of that, we've done, I think, a great job in terms of business process
outsourcing. We've taken back office costs down there. And again, the benefits of ACE in the factories is really starting
to pay off. We just priced, I think, it was [ph] Lot 4 on the -- or L Route 4 for the JSF. Those costs are going to come
down 16% from L Route 3 (34:45). And again, we're driving costs in the factory down. We're also driving costs down
in the supply chain.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I mean, the reality is your -- probably head count is probably down and revenues are
relatively flat, and when you look at the mix, even if you probably were to adjust for spares, Greg, again your structural
costs seem to be working in your favor?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: [indiscernible] (35:06) That was the point I tried to make earlier, the fact that with revenues
down still 4% from peak, earnings are going to be up 10% with $200 million of higher E&D. So that's really the – that's
the evidence that all of those structural costs that we took out, we spent a $1.5 billion restructuring this place over the
last three years. It really does pay off, and you're going to see it on the bottom-line this year and next, when these
orders come back and sales recover.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then just to stay on this issue of restructuring for a moment, if we take out the low
margin revenues from the distribution business at Carrier and the businesses that you've sold or JVed, can you give us a
little bit of color as to what, if we look at revenue comps, year-on-year, how much of it – obviously, some of it's
Transicold, but some of it's also the absence of lower margin business? Can you provide a little bit of color on that?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Howard, you're talking about a benefit to the margin from this portfolio transformation?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Yes.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Actually, it's not that big a number. It's probably between 50 to 70 basis points of margin
expansion you'd attribute to the portfolio transformation. I think if you go back in the road to 12% by '12 [ph] Jerowe
(36:10) had laid out, about 150 basis points of margin expansion going out of a total 450 or 500 basis points. And I
think we are getting close to that on a cumulative basis. So most of the improvement you saw in Carrier this quarter

have taken out and the benefit of the mix to some extent.

And we'll take our next question from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Thanks. Morning. Hey, Greg, wanted to come back to the Carrier margin guidance for the
balance of the year, if we back out the first quarter year-over-year from the $2.50 guidance, about $85 million. Even if I
assume that organic growth drops into the mid-single digits, it implies a 10% incremental margin. You've talked about
the commodity headwinds, net of price, actually get less challenging at the overall company level, presumably Carrier's
got the same profile. So I'm still struggling to see why Carrier margins in the back half of the year wouldn't have
substantial upside to your guidance here? What am I missing there?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah, Terry, I think a couple of things to think about. Firstly, when you look at the margins or the
decremental incremental margins based on just the reported volumes, you've got to take into account the divestitures
that are happening, because they have a slightly different impact on the margins. And when I adjust for that, at least
internally when we look at it, it looks like the margins in the back half of the year will be between 25% to 27%, 28% as
compared to a little over 30% for the first quarter. So it's not a huge change in the incremental margins we are
expecting on organic revenue for the back half. So – and we can talk more offline just so I can take you through that
math, if you want.
<Q - Terry Darling>: That's helpful.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I can also say, Terry, that there's a reason we put a plus next to the [ph] $275 million or $250
millon rather. I should have said $275 million, shouldn't I (38:04)?
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. And then on the Fire & Security margins, I guess going the other way, about a 17%
incremental, despite the ongoing benefits of the GE Security integration. How do you see that ramping through the
year? And do you still feel like 15% margins 2012 is a high confidence number at this point?
<A - Akhil Johri>: It is, Terry. I think we still feel good about it. First quarter margins were a little light, but not
surprising because F&S, as you know, has been investing in the sales force and in E&D that Bill talked about in March.
So some of those costs are coming in while they continue to get the benefits of the field integration efforts that have
been put in place. So as volume comes back and we do expect organic growth to be higher for the rest of the year, you
would expect greater conversion or better drop-through in terms of returns from those investments. I think we do see
accelerating margin expansion for -- in the back half of this year at F&S, and that should continue and put us on good
track for 15% by '12.
<Q - Terry Darling>: And just to understand the mix implications, I think you called out Asia double-digits, Products
up mid-single digits, and the rest of it flat. In terms of this organic pick up, are you talking about the rest of the
business, your non-Asia, non-Products, picking up and that helps the margin, because I would have thought the
Products piece growing stronger than the other would have been good for margins?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: The Products piece, obviously, the margins are a little bit better, but where really going to
see it is on the service and installation side. That's where the recovery has to come. And Akhil talked about, we expect
field productivity to get better during the course of the year. We didn't see a lot of that in the first quarter, but that's
really where you're going to see the margin expansion because that's really, that's structural cost that's been taken out.
So as those incremental dollars come back, you're going to see really strong conversion on those incremental sales.

<A - Akhil Johri>: Right. And, just, I think I mentioned this earlier, Terry, but if you keep in mind the encouraging
thing in Q1 orders for F&S was that the organic growth on the service and install orders was better than we have seen
all of 2010. It wasn't on the back of product orders. And, I think, as those businesses do higher organic growth, then the
benefits of field conversion will be greater. Field integration will be greater.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. That's helpful. What was that number on the service orders organic again, Akhil, sorry if I
missed that?
<A - Akhil Johri>: It went up mid-single digits in first quarter organically.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. And then just lastly on 2Q, Greg, appreciating you don't give EPS guidance, but I just
wonder if you might tick through some of the items you did call out, the 2Q tax rate? Can you touch on Canadian
Maritime impact? And then as it relates to Japan, I mean, obviously, there is no full-year impact, but will there be some
negative impact in 2Q that's offset by a recovery in 3Q or 4Q or is there no 2Q impact from Japan at all?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: A couple of things you should think about Q2. Obviously, the Canadian Maritime will
continue to be a drag at Sikorsky. We expect to deliver three Canadian Maritime helicopters. We're losing $10 million
to $12 million a piece on those. So that will put Sikorsky's Q2 under a lot of pressure. As far as Japan, again, we're
talking less than $0.01 of impact here probably in the second quarter. So any of that would be recovered in the third
quarter, but it's not, it's really not significant in the second quarter.
Other than that, I mean, we talked about the tax rate. That's actually going down Q1 to Q2. And we had a couple of
cents of uncovered restructuring in first quarter. We'll probably have a couple of cents going the other way in the
second quarter. So as we rack and stack second quarter, it looks pretty good.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And we'll go next to Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, hi. A question, Greg, you talked about possibly accelerating E&D with the A320/NEO. Can
you also add to that our understanding as you embark on discussions on the A350 GTF potential? If that were to
proceed, how should we think about how that would affect E&D heading into this year and over the next several years?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, any talk about the -- a GTF on the A350, I think, is way out into the future. Pratt's got
its hands full, and we're focused really on the narrow-body with this engine. I think the next place you're going to see
an application for the GTF would either be on a next generation Boeing aircraft or an Embraer aircraft. But I think the
wide-body market is still probably, I'm guessing, five to 10 years out before we'd see any type of significant investment
there.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Okay. Okay. I wondered about that. I thought it was a bigger leap, so good to get that. And then a
nit on the Carrier side, just to understand better, you said, talked about residential being up in the mid-teens. Can you
give us some more granularity on what you're seeing on the puts and takes there? I mean, are we seeing we're scraping
off the bottom in residential finally?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, I think, again, as we said, entering the year, we knew that channel inventory was low.
And I go back to this whole issue of the replacement market. Housing is still anemic. So all of the good news is really
going to come on the replacement side, or the add-on replacement, as we call it, and there is, I think I said it this
morning. There's 93 million air conditioners, residential air conditioners out there in the U.S. And the replacement
cycle would indicate a demand between 5 million and 6 million, and the industry is only building 4.5 million. So I
really think there's just pent-up demand in the system. And as the economy gets better, as people feel better about their
job prospects, I would expect we're going to see more of the AOR business. And that 4.5 million – now will it go up a
lot this year? Probably not. But certainly in the coming years, we're going to see a recovery there. That's the upside
opportunity we have.

<Q - Heidi Wood>: All right. Great. And then one last question, Greg, on M&A. And a little bit of a devil's advocate
question, working a little bit off what Ron talked about earlier in this call. Wouldn't it make sense that more strategic
deals ought to occur when you're at the trough in a global economy right before we head into an upturn? Isn't that
theoretically when you're going to have the best opportunities?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think that's probably exactly right. And so I think that's why we paid $1.8 billion for the GE
Security business a year ago. That really was the trough of the market. What we're seeing now is price expectations in
stocks running up in anticipation of a broader market recovery and peoples' expectations running even ahead of that in
terms of premiums on deals. So, look, we'd love to do deals. We would love to deploy this cash that we've got. We've
got $4.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We've got debt-to-cap at 31%. So we've got a lot of powder. But it's still
got to be for the right deal.
And I would tell you, bringing Bill Brown down to the Corporate office as Head of Corporate Strategy and M&A, it
signals Louis' intention, I think. We're going to turn up the game here, but we're still going to be disciplined. We're not
going to go after things that don't make sense. It's got to be in the core. It's got to be for the right price.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: All right. Great. Thanks very much, Greg.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague CFA>: Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about price and
orders. Obviously, there was – you alluded to some soft price in Otis and other places. Kind of struck me, though, that
even in Transicold containers, where you're back to peak volumes, you're still seeing weak price. Can you just give us a
little bit of the lay of the land there? And particularly in large, in the heavy iron in Otis and Carrier Commercial, are
you at least seeing a little bit of firming of price or is it still downward bias?
<A - Akhil Johri>: I think, Jeff, Otis certainly is seeing pricing pressure, not surprisingly, because the market has been
down for a long time. And in that situation, pricing does come under pressure. It's in select geographies. Certain
markets have always faced price pressure. And the good news is that Otis knows how to offset the impact of that
through cost reduction. They are extremely good at doing that. And that's why they are being able to maintain the
margins at the levels that they have. So I think that's nothing new.
On the commercial side for Carrier, pricing is, as you would expect in projects, it's project dependent. The
energy-efficiency projects, which have a good payback, generally tend to be better from a price point of view. And
there are some others which are new construction-related where pricing can be tougher.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague CFA>: Can you give us a sense of that mix, how much activity you're actually seeing in physical
square footage addition in some of these commercial markets relative to the energy retro-fit?
<A - Akhil Johri>: A lot of what we are seeing is on the energy retro-fit side because I think especially with the prices,
fuel price is a concern and energy-efficiency being more topical with the new -- introduction of new energy-efficiency
– energy-efficient products out of Carrier. I think there is a lot of what we are seeing on that side of the equation and
not very much on the new construction.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, just to be clear though. I mean, there's really a dichotomy in the market where you've
got the U.S. and Europe where the focus is on energy efficiency. And that's where the BSS, or the global HVAC
business, is doing well. As well in China, which is just really the boom in new construction there continues. We see it
at Otis. Their orders are up 17%. And we saw it at Carrier, where their orders were up 34% in the quarter. So that's not
just the energy-efficiency play. That is really just where the market is going.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague CFA>: And on containers, the sloppiness there is – just what's driving that? There's still excess
capacity there, although we're back to peak volumes?

We'll go next to Robert Stallard with the Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: Thanks much. Morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Rob.
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: Greg, I was just going to ask you a couple of questions on the aerospace aftermarket. Would
it be far to say that your performance in Q1 has beaten your expectations and therefore you've taken down your forecast
for the back half of the year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, it wouldn't be fair. Look, as we – the first quarter was very solid. But if you take a look
at the run rate at Pratt for spares in the first quarter, it's really the run rate we expect for the first – for the full year.
You've got to back to last year's first quarter, which was just awful from spares, I mean, down significantly. So this is
just kind of a snap-back but we still expect low double-digit growth in spares for Pratt for the year and the same at
Hamilton. It's just this is an abnormally easy compare to last year. We're down what, 15% last year?
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: Yeah. So you'd expect growth in orders in the second half to be roughly half then, what
you're seeing at the moment?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. That's probably right. Because again, remember, we had a huge fourth quarter last
year, with orders up over 40%, up more than 30% last year's third quarter. So the compares get really, really tough.
You still get – and you've got the dynamic of oil. What's that going to do to the airlines' buying behavior in the back
half of the year? So -- but we would stand by the forecast of the low double-digit. Could we get surprised on the
upside? Maybe. But again, it's still April.
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: Okay. And then secondly, I was wondering if you could give us update on the 787 and
whether you've included any [ph] initial 7-8 sparing in there (49:26)?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We do have, in Hamilton's outlook for the year, some initial provisioning, although it's
relatively modest. The first customer for 787 is actually ANA, All Nippon Airways. And they're actually going to be on
our Care program, which is a nose-to-tail program where there won't be much provisioning. So really the big bump is
going to come next year as Boeing ramps up production and some of the airlines start taking initial provisioning.
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Rob.

We'll go next to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr MBA, CFA>: Yes, thanks an awful lot. So you were up $88 million year-over-year in R&D in
the first quarter. I would assume Pratt's going to continue to build. So could you be up more than the $225 million? I
mean, help us understand that pattern and what drives it?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, we talked about for the full year we're going to up $200 million to $225 million, with
probably bias up to upside. Pratt's got $175 million of that $200 million to $225 million increase built in. So the run
rate increase probably won't be as big in the coming quarters. Again, we ramped up spending last year as the year went
on, but clearly there is a bias on the upside for Pratt on the E&D line.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr MBA, CFA>: Okay. And then you'd mentioned that the uncovered restructuring, but you also
mentioned $20 million of non-recurring cap gains at Carrier in the quarter. Were there any other non-recurring gains or
negatives in the operations?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yes, Cai, this is Akhil. I did mention that in the Pratt segment there was also a gain, roughly $15
million, which offset the pension costs. And that had to do with divestiture of a portion we had in a joint venture.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr MBA, CFA>: Okay. But $15 million plus $20 million is $35 million. So that's actually larger
than the restructuring because pension is an ongoing issue. Is that right?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's about even. Yes. It offsets.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr MBA, CFA>: Great. And then the last one, you basically were down at Sikorsky in the first
quarter, with the three Canadian helicopters, sounds like it's a pretty tough second quarter. If you're going to be up $100
million for the year, it assumes huge numbers in the second half. Is that achievable? Or does that maybe have a little bit
of a rip to that number?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It is achievable. I would tell you it's not without risk. I think we've got to see a return of
growth in the aftermarket in Sikorsky on the commercial side. We need to see a little bit of a recovery on the
commercial side. Most of that increase, though, is going to come from the factory floor. That's cost take out. And I
think we're confident as far as our ability to take out costs in the production cycle. But it still is dependent upon a
market recovery on the commercial side.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr MBA, CFA>: Okay. Terrific. Thank you very much.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thank you, Cai.

We'll go next to David Strauss with UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss MBA>: Morning, Greg, Akhil.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss MBA>: Could you, Greg, could you reconcile where we are now with the contingency? I think
we started at $200 million. You took some in at the Investor Day. Where do we stand now with the contingency?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, at the high end of the range today, I would tell you that the math that we used to get to
the contingency is about $0. But again, I think there's probably still upside in the potential. You've got the euro
potential upside and perhaps Carrier in the second quarter, if the good news there continues. But the math that we
talked about, the $200 million contingency, remember that was at the mid-point of the initial range. Now we've moved
that range up from $520 million to $533 million is the mid-point. At the high end of that, essentially $0. But still we
feel pretty comfortable with where we are.
<Q - David E. Strauss MBA>: And at Carrier, can you run us through your assumptions around res for the full year,
Commercial for the full year in terms of volumes and then also at Transicold and commercial relative to the low
double-digit organic growth you're looking at for the full year?

<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah. I think this is the only real change based on first quarter is the Transicold business, where we
think instead of being up over 10%, which is what [ph] Joe (53:32) had mentioned in March, we probably think it's
more like 15% to 20%. And that's the primary reason for the uptake of the Carrier guidance. For most of the other
markets, even the res was a little stronger in the first quarter. It is a low quarter. And also some of it had to do with the
distributor restocking that we talked about. So we still think that for the full year between 5% to 10% for U.S.
residential is an appropriate level at this point and for the commercial HVAC, similarly I think we talked about
mid-single digit type of growth on an organic basis.
So not much change in the assumptions for other markets except for Transicold, which we think will be higher now.
<Q - David E. Strauss MBA>: Okay. And then similar question at Otis, your mid-single-digit organic growth rate
assumption, what are you assuming now for – are you still [ph] communicating (54:20) the same low to
mid-single-digit growth in new equipment revenues?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yes.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes.
<Q - David E. Strauss MBA>: Okay. And last one for me, I think I recall that back in December, interest expense,
Greg, you had talked about it being higher in 2011 relative to last year, yet it was much lower in the first quarter. What
are you thinking about in terms of interest expense through the year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We still think that the overall interest expense will probably be flattish year-over-year. We're
going to issue some additional debt here probably second or third quarter, depending upon cash loads, but it looks like
we'll probably go to the market, maybe end of second quarter, early third quarter. But we'll see how that all goes. Also,
last year, interest expense was a little elevated in the third quarter. We had some charges associated with some tax
reserves. We had to put up some interest on those tax reserves. So makes the compare a little difficult.
<Q - David E. Strauss MBA>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, David.

We'll take our next question from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Greg, you said that on the F35 engine that [ph] L Route 4 versus L Route 3 (55:26) that your
costs are down 16%. Is that a measure of the pricing in [ph] L Route 4 (55:34), your cost base or is it both that are
down?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No. It's both. Look, this is all cost-based pricing that we're doing out there. And we're right
on the slope that we had agreed to with the JPO, that's the JSF Program Office, as we get into full-rate production here
in the next couple of years. So they're on the glide path. They're getting the costs out. As a result, the sell price is
coming down in line with government's expectations. Now are they going to be happy? No, probably not. But the fact
is we're right on top of where we committed to be. So -- we feel pretty good about that.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: And then on the geared turbo fan on the A320/NEO, can you give a sense as to how your
discussions are going? And what I mean by that is, right now if you look at the serious negotiations you may be having,
are those say a few? Are you talking about dozens? What's the scale of the interest in this engine?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: There's a lot of interest out there. It is not just a few. I'd say there are numerous airline
customers that we're out there talking to. And it's a great place to be. I think the value that the GTF brings to the table is

really recognized by the airlines. And I think that's why we've won these first three. And I'd expect that there'll be more
by the time we get to Paris because people see the value proposition of JSF. This thing saves $1.5 million per airplane
per year. And so, again, I think pricing, it's not awful.
In fact, I would tell you the pricing on these initial orders is actually better than what we saw on others initial orders for
new platform introductions. So feel pretty good about where we are.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: And have you found the challenge on pricing to be more on engine price or on how you're
looking at guarantees with respect to maintenance costs and liability?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, look the – it's all a package as you come to the end of it. But the fact is, the GTF, as
we've told you – or as we've told our customers, you're going to see about a 20% reduction in maintenance costs over
the life of the program. So that's being reflected. But, again, I think we're getting value from that from the customers.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

We'll go next to George Shapiro with Access 342.
<Q - George D. Shapiro MBA>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro MBA>: Greg, or Akhil, sequentially, the spares at Pratt, I assume, were probably down a
little bit because of your natural price increase on January. Was that also true at Hamilton Sunstrand?
<A - Akhil Johri>: That's true in both cases. Yes.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes.
<Q - George D. Shapiro MBA>: Does Hamilton get a price increase in January, as well?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. They have the same catalog price increase that goes out 1st of October just like Pratt
that's effective January 1 of each year, so same kind of phenomenon.
<Q - George D. Shapiro MBA>: Okay. And I think you mentioned, Akhil, that Hamilton Sunstrand, the book-to-bill
is above 1%. Was that above 1% at Pratt, as well?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Pratt was almost exactly 1% and Hamilton was slightly above 1%.
<Q - George D. Shapiro MBA>: Okay. And then you mentioned that the Sikorsky was hurt in the quarter because you
had the one Canadian delivery, which you've talked about, but also less S-92s. Can you quantify how many less you
had versus last year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, there were about three less S-92s and that – a little more than a $0.01 of impact to
Sikorsky's results.
<Q - George D. Shapiro MBA>: Okay. And if I look at Carrier and Transicold, it would seem like Transicold was
probably up north of $200 million in revenues in the quarter and probably would have been $75 million or so profit
contribution. Are those numbers in the ball park?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah, not that far.
<Q - George D. Shapiro MBA>: Okay. And then just at Otis, the services, you said, were up in the quarter. I just
assume they're up the normal 4% or so.

Operator
Okay. We'll go to Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Yes. Thanks. Greg, I just had a question really on the year-on-year implied growth rates in
your earnings versus your sales. Because I understand that organic sales growth, the comps get tougher as you go
through the year. If you look at earnings growth, your full year guidance implies, I guess, earnings growth exiting this
year is around half the 19% that you did in Q1, but it sounds as if, for example, the E&D headwind gets a bit less in
terms of year-on-year effect in the second half. So is there anything beyond just organic sales growth slowing that you
think will affect incremental margins overall in the second half? Perhaps, I guess, there's the commodities thing you
mentioned earlier.
<A - Akhil Johri>: That's one, Julian. Also keep in mind that restructuring in excess of gains last year was like $0.17
in the first half and it was only $0.12 in the second half. And this year we are talking about being equal in both halves,
right. So I think that does drive a little bit of the EPS compares, as well.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Okay. Got it. And just in Otis, I mean, you mentioned pricing yourself earlier. One of your
peers in Europe, obviously, made a big deal about it in their prepared comments this morning, as well, on their
earnings. Is there anything actually changing there or it's just it's always a steady-state tough pricing environment?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, pricing has been tougher, as Akhil mentioned, over the last couple of years. As the
market has been dropping here in the U.S. and in Europe, pricing has just gotten progressively tougher because there
were fewer jobs to go after and we're trying to retain pricing discipline. I think Otis has done that while maintaining its
share in the market. But pricing is tough and I think that'll play itself out here as you see we start delivering these
orders in the next 12 months.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Julian.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay, as we close out the call today, I just want to thank everybody for listening, but I also want to say a special thanks
to [ph] Jay Malabi, (1:01:26) who will be leaving the IR team next week to take over as Vice President of Financial
Planning and Analysis and Treasury at Hamilton Sunstrand. Jay has done a great job these past two years and we wish
him well. Replacing Jay is [ph] Imelda Suit. Imelda (1:01:37) comes to us from Otis, where she was responsible for
FP&A, as well as Treasury Service and Business Development at Otis' North and South American operations. Jay and
Imelda will be on the call later today, so please take a chance to wish them both well.
To close, it's a great start to the year, one that gives us confidence in the outlook and we look forward to talking to you
later today. Thank you.
