MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Allstate Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions
will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to
introduce your host for today's program, Pat Macellaro, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patrick Macellaro
Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's Second Quarter 2014
Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson and Steve Shebik, we'll have a question-and-answer
session.
Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for
the second quarter, posted a slide presentation to be viewed in conjunction with our prepared remarks. We also posted
an update to the description of our reinsurance program. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.
As noted on the first slide, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's
operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2013, our 10-Q
for the second quarter, slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks.
Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and
on our website. We're recording the call today and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I, along with
Steve Shebik, will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. And now let's begin
with Tom Wilson.

Thomas Joseph Wilson
So good morning, thank you for investing your time to keep updated on Allstate's progress. In addition to Pat and
Steve, with us today in the room is the team that delivered these great results: Matt Winter, who leads Allstate's
Personal Lines; Don Civgin, who's responsible for Allstate Financial and Esurance; Kathy Mabe, who leads Business to
Business; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.
Now let's begin on slide two. Allstate's second quarter results demonstrate our ability to concurrently grow the business
and generate attractive returns. Our strategy to create unique customer value propositions for each consumer segment is
working and it's helped us compete in new and different ways. So in the last 12 months, we've added almost .75 million
property and liability policies in force. In addition, we added another 900,000 relationships through our Good Hands
Roadside and Allstate Benefits offerings. Positive growth momentum is building, particularly in the Allstate brand.
Secondly, we made good progress on all of our 2014 operating priorities. Third, we reported very good financial
results. Net income was $614 million for the quarter, which you can see in that bottom table, which was higher than last
year since there was a loss on the extinguishment of high-cost debt in the 2013 results. Operating income was $1.01 per
share, excellent results in light of incurring $936 million of catastrophe losses. Strong underlying profitability, lower
expenses and good investment results all contributed to the positive operating results. The decline in operating earnings
versus the prior year was due to higher catastrophe losses.
Lastly, we improved our financial strength while returning capital to shareholders. The 18-month $2.5 billion share
repurchase program approved in February is now 40% complete after four months. Open market purchases were made
throughout the quarter through accelerated stock – the stock repurchase program and the company's share repurchases,
which are alongside that program. I think when you look at the supplemental, a number of people didn't understand the
fact that the company's repurchases are in addition to the open market purchases made under the ASR. Overall, we're
executing well and we're poised to grow with attractive returns and further leverage our capabilities to create
shareholder value.
Go to slide three. This visually combines our strategy and our current operating results for each customer segment. So
overall, the .75 million increase in property-liability policies represents a unit growth rate of 2.2%. Increased average
premiums for our Allstate Protection net written premium growth of 5.5% over the prior year. The recorded combined
ratio of 97.4 reflects 13 points of catastrophe losses; therefore the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 84.7.
Let's walk through each of the customer segments, starting with the Allstate brand, which represents 91% of written
premiums. As you can see in the lower left quadrant, auto policy growth increased again this quarter and was 2.3%.
Working across the growth line, the decline in homeowners continues to shrink and was now down to .5% this quarter.
Other personal lines are growing, bringing total policy in force growth in this segment to 1.5% and net written premium
growth to 5%.
We're also pleased with the profitability in this segment, with a recorded combined ratio of 95.4, which you can see in
the third line, on the far right there. If you go back to the left, the auto recorded combined ratio was also 95.4, which
results from a disciplined and precise set of operating processes focused on matching price to risk and cost. We
continue to have modest increases in auto prices, which were up .5% this quarter excluding Canada. A few analysts
called about the investor supplement, which shows no increase in total because of the impacts of a large mandatory
reduction in Ontario auto pricing. Another measure of auto pricing discipline is average gross written premium, which
is 2.6% higher than a year ago.
Moving to the next column, the recorded homeowners combined ratio 98.6, despite almost 39 points of catastrophe
losses. An underlying combined ratio of 60.2 for this product gives us confidence that we can create shareholder value
and improve our competitive position by grow this line.
Esurance, in the lower right, had another quarter of strong growth, with policies in force up 17.5%, although this is
lower than last year as expected. The combined ratio of this brand reflects the immediate expensing of acquisition cost,
as improved from last year due to profit improvement actions taken to ensure we get acceptable economic returns.

Encompass, in the upper left, also continued to grow policies but at a slower rate than last year, also as expected. With
an underlying combined ratio of 94.8, there's still more work to be done to raise returns. Answer Financial sells
nonproprietary policies – that's in the upper right – through the web and call centers. Nonproprietary premium
increased 12.6% over the prior year. Our five operating priorities are shown on slide four. So we just covered the
second quarter results on growth and profitability, so I'll give you a chance to just read the bullet points, then I'll move
on to the next three priorities.
Investment returns were favorable in the quarter as higher limited partnership income more than offset the expected
decline in interest income. You'll remember the risk and return trade-off we made in shortening the duration of the
property-liability portfolio, which resulted in capital gains, but lowered investment income by over $100 million
annually.
Our efforts to modernize the operating model showed up in lower operating expenses at Allstate Financial, reflecting
actions taken because of the sale of Lincoln Benefit. The benefit plan changes made in 2013 also led to lower expenses.
Long-term growth efforts include expanding our Allstate agency capacity in underserved markets. Allstate agencies are
also investing in growth alongside the company and, collectively, we're working to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of this powerful local model.
Esurance continued to expand its business and it offers auto insurance in 43 states, renters insurance in 18 states,
motorcycle insurance in nine states and homeowners insurance in seven states as of the end of the quarter. And we
continue to expand that product portfolio throughout the year.
The breadth of this set of underwritten products is designed to give us a competitive advantage by better serving
customers and lowering acquisition costs in comparison to other direct writers. We're also investing aggressively in
telematics and are achieving rapid growth in utilization of the Allstate branded Drivewise and Esurance DriveSense
offerings. We're testing additional features, which extend the benefits of being connected, beyond more accurate
pricing.
In summary, halfway through the year, we've made very good progress on our 2014 priorities. Steve will now cover the
operating results in greater detail.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, Tom. I'll begin by reviewing the second quarter financial highlights on slide five. Beginning with the upper
left, property-liability earned premium of $7.2 billion in the second quarter was 5% higher than the second quarter of
2013. The recorded combined ratio of 97.4 increased 1.3 points versus the comparable 2013 quarter, driven by $936
million in catastrophe losses, which were 45% higher than the prior year. The underlying combined ratio was an 84.7
for the second quarter and 86.6 year-to-date, which is below our full year outlook range of 87 to 89.
Net investment income for the property-liability segment increased 2.3% from the prior-year quarter, driven primarily
by limited partnership income. Property liability operating income in the second quarter was $364 million, 15.9% lower
than the second quarter of 2013. The property-liability combined ratio on a recorded underlying basis is shown in the
chart on the upper right hand side of the slide. You can see that while the recorded combined ratio rose in the second
quarter due to catastrophe losses, the underlying combined ratio was very favorable, as we did not experience a repeat
of the adverse weather encountered in the first quarter.
The table below this chart provides a view of the underlying combined ratio trends by brand for the past six quarters.
We have also broken out the Esurance underlying loss ratio to remove the impact of investments and advertising and
expansion, which are immediately expensed, and provide greater transparency to our ongoing profit improvement
actions. As Tom mentioned earlier, you can see the Esurance loss ratio is starting to benefit from the actions that we
have taken to-date.
Allstate Financial, on the bottom half of the slide, had a 10.5% decrease in premiums and contract charges in the
second quarter, resulting from the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Operating income of $165 million was a 5.1%

improvement over the second quarter of 2013, driven by higher investment and benefit spreads and lower operating
expenses. Net income of $145 million for the second quarter includes an additional $13 million after-tax loss on the
sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Excluding LBL's second quarter 2013 results, operating income increased by 31% and net
income declined by 10.5% in the second quarter of 2014. Our second quarter 2014 10-Q and investor supplement both
contain estimated historical results from Lincoln Benefit Life, provide you with further context. Allstate Financial is
now a smaller but more focused company, but still capable of producing meaningful operating income.
On slide six, we show net written premium and policies in force growth rates for Allstate Protection and by brand. For
Allstate Protection, in the upper left chart, the red line shows the continued trend of policy growth that began the
second quarter of 2013. Policies have grown by 735,000, or 2.2%, from last year's second quarter and 407,000, or
1.2%, from year-end 2013. Each brand where we accept underwriting risk achieved growth in the second quarter in
both written premium and policies compared with the prior-year quarter.
Moving over to the upper right chart, Allstate brand policies ended the quarter 1.5% higher than the second quarter of
2013, totaling 463,000 policies. The Allstate brand grew net written premium 5% in the second quarter versus the
prior-year quarter, driven by continued favorable trends in new business, retention and higher average premium.
Allstate brand auto net written premium increased 4.9% from the prior year, but policies rose 450,000, or 2.3%, from
the second quarter of 2013.
Allstate brand homeowners net written premium grew 4.3%, while the rate of decline in policies in force slowed to
0.5%, or 28,000 policies, compared with the prior-year quarter. On the bottom two charts, you can see the growth
trends for Encompass and Esurance. Encompass policy in force growth continues to slow, reflecting actions taken to
ensure acceptable long-term returns. Net written premium growth of 8.3% in the second quarter compared to the
second quarter of 2013 reflects higher average premiums due to rate increases that are earning in over time. Esurance's
rate of premium and policy growth continues to slow due to its increasing size as well as the ongoing pricing and
underwriting actions underway to ensure long-term profitability. Total Esurance premium had grown over 65% and
policies in force over 80% since its acquisition in October of 2011.
Slide seven highlights Allstate brand auto and homeowners underlying margin trends. The charts on the left side show
Allstate brand auto and home combined ratio trends, while the charts on the right show quarterly change in earned
premium and underwriting loss trends. As you can see, while there is volatility in the trends in the chart on the right,
the longer term underlying combined ratio results on the left have been fairly stable and demonstrate the success we
experienced with maintaining auto margins while improving homeowners'.
For Allstate brand auto, in the upper right hand chart, we experienced frequency results that performed within historical
ranges in the second quarter as the adverse impact of severe winter weather in the first quarter was not repeated.
Severity results showed only a modest increase over prior year, resulting in a decline in the average underlying loss in
the second quarter of 1% compared with second quarter of 2013.
And we continue to earn previously approved auto rate increases as average earned premium increased 1.6% in the
second quarter compared to the prior-year quarter. For Allstate brand homeowners, in the lower right hand chart, we
also experienced more favorable underlying losses in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. Average
earned premium continued to increase, although at a slowing rate, as we approach rate adequacy in total. We continue
to take rate increases as needed in both lines to keep pace with loss trends and maintain our underlying combined ratio.
On slide eight, in the top left graph, you see the composition of the investment portfolio and the impact of the sale of
Lincoln Benefit Life, which reduced the size of the portfolio by $12 billion dollars. Over time we are shifting the
portfolio composition to an asset mix we believe will have higher returns, relying less on interest bearing assets and
more on equity and other assets whose return is derived from idiosyncratic operating performance. Our total portfolio
return, presented in the top right, was a strong 2.2% for the second quarter, reflecting increased fixed income valuation
and positive equity market performance. You can see, however, that the valuation impact is highly variable while the
income yield has been relatively constant over the last five quarters.

Our second quarter investment income before expenses was $932 million, with a total portfolio yield of 4.7%. The
lower half of the slide provides the investment income in yield for the property-liability and Allstate Financial
portfolios, each of which now comprise approximately half of the portfolio. For the property-liability portfolio in the
lower left graft, the interest-bearing yield has stabilized after the 2013 rate risk reduction actions Tom mentioned, while
the total yield illustrates the variability in income that may result from equity investments, including our limited
partnership investments. The Allstate Financial portfolio in lower right graph trends consistently, however, you can see
the decline in our second quarter income driven by the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.
Our capital position is strong. Turning to slide nine, on the left side, you can see the change in the composition of our
capital structure over time, from senior debt to hybrid debt and preferred stock. A pro forma view of our capital mix,
adjusted for the expected repayment of $650 million of senior debt in August, is also shown on the far left bar.
We took advantage of favorable market condition in the second quarter, issued an additional $250 million of
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, providing further financial and strategic flexibility. During the quarter we
repurchased $142 million of common shares through open market purchases and paid $125 million in common stock
dividends, for a total cash return to common shareholders of $267 million, bringing total common shareholder cash
returns to $1.37 billion dollars year-to-date. We completed the accelerated share repurchase program announced in
March on June (sic) [July] 29, with receipt of [ph] $1.77 million in (18:05) additional shares. Book value per common
share reached a record $47.97, increasing 5.9% since year-end and 15.2% since June 30 of last year. Our estimated
statutory surplus at June 30 was $18 billion.
Allstate Life distributed $700 million in a return of capital to its parent, the Allstate Insurance Company, during the
quarter. Our operating income return on equity was a strong 13.7% in the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis,
but lower than the full year 2013 return of 14.5%, reflecting the impact of higher catastrophe losses in first half of this
year along with higher equity. The increased equity is a result of our 2013 benefit and plan assumption changes. As you
can see in the table in the upper right, average trailing equity is essentially flat from year-end 2013 to June 30. The
impact of the benefit changes will enter into the calculation in the third quarter.
Overall, we continue to make good progress on the execution of our customer-focused strategy and our operating
priorities in the second quarter.
Now let's open the call up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you, and good morning. The underlying P&C [property & casualty] combined ratio of 84.7,
if my data's right, that's the best of any quarter in the past six years. So first, it's a great result. Second, just wanted to
see if there was any lack of non-cat weather or other factors that would cause that to be lower than you might think on a
go-forward basis?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Jay, make sure I get the second part of that question. So the question was whether
weather had an impact on growth?
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: No, I'm sorry, on the underlying combined ratio, of non-cat weather, or any other factors?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Oh, sure, sure. Yeah. First, thank you. We feel like we've made a lot of progress. Matt
can talk about the underlying combined ratio.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Good morning, Jay. There was nothing out of the ordinary this quarter from an underlying
standpoint. As you know, we just had a lot of rate earning in. We had a fairly careful management of claims continuing
and we had an underwriting expense ratio that was down. And as a result, all of the discipline that's been put into the

business over the past many years is just starting to show through.
Frequency improved, trends were broad based. Paid severity was pretty much in line on the BI [bodily injury] side. On
the PD [property damage], actually, we had some claims that shifted over from first quarter to second quarter because
of such a high claim volume in the first quarter. So some third party subro demands came in in the second quarter and
so that just changed quarter-over-quarter a little bit on the PD side. But overall, there was nothing extraordinary there.
Nothing out of the ordinary, and we think it's just a continuation of the hard work that's been put into the business.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: All right. And then the pace of share buybacks slowed pretty meaningfully in 2Q relative to 1Q.
And as you mentioned in the prepared remarks, the accelerated share repurchase program probably had a fair amount to
do with that. But I'm just trying to get a better sense of what a normalized buyback pace might be on a go-forward
perspective?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So as I said, we completed our accelerated share buyback program we started in March. I
think Tom noted, I said it was June 29. It was actually July 29 that we completed it. When we enter into a program like
that, effectively, we give the buyback program for that piece to another party. In this case it was Barclays. So they buy
over a period of time, in this case four months.
So we buy alongside them, but we effectively get a fair amount of the shares from the money we provide to Barclays
up front. So we recorded all that in the first quarter. So we had such a strong buyback number in first quarter. In the
second quarter it was really open market purchases alongside the program and that program has now ended this week
and we are back in the market ourselves buying.
So if you think we are – we've announced we're going to do $2.5 billion buyback over 18 months, essentially. You do
some division; it's about $150 million a month is the ongoing rate we go. And there are times when we accelerate that,
generally earlier in the program; and over the summer we generally go a little bit slower than $150 million. Now we do
have a strong capital position, clearly. So we have probably more flexibility than we've had in prior years, when during
the hurricane season, probably July through September, we would slow down our program.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Jay, let me build on Steve's answer there. So we're 40% of the way done in 20% of the
time. So there should be no confusion as to our commitment to do this aggressively. I think what you just see is, it's the
way the numbers get accounted that makes it look like we're not active in the market. We're active in the market and
we're aggressively buying back as much as we think is prudent given the float.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: That's great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital. Your question, please.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Well, he got the second one right. Good morning everyone. I want to pyramid into your bullet
point on modernizing operating structure at Allstate Financial, just to get a sense of where the cost structure is on
go-forward basis. You have a program to reduce expenses. You're absorbing a little bit more of corporate overhead
without Lincoln in the mix. When are you at your right run rate of expenses and how much lower can it go from the
current rate?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Bob, let me make a comment about general corporate expenses and then Don can
address Allstate Financial. So we've always been about reducing expenses, whether that be the benefit plan changes we
talked about last year, which would reduce expenses you see rattle through the P&L, or it's just normal continuous
improvement simplification. The benefit we now have is, by growing revenues, you'll see more of that flow through the
bottom line. So in the past, when revenues and PIF [policies in force] counts were going down, it's hard to get ahead of
that in terms of your expense ratio. So what you should begin to see is our growth create a little more incremental
margin for us.

Don can talk specifically about Allstate Financial, because they're doing a great job of getting ahead of the downsizing
there.
<A - Don Civgin>: All right. Thanks, Tom. So the strategy for Allstate Financial has been the same for a number of
years and that's been to simplify our focus so that we're all about the Allstate customer and the Allstate agency. The
Lincoln Benefit transaction obviously was an important step in that because it not only reduced the size of the balance
sheet, allowed us to free up some capital for the parent company, but also then allowed us to focus all of our efforts on
one distribution channel, which is the Allstate channel.
There has been a lot of hard work, and thanks for noticing it, that has taken place to try and get our cost structure down
because we're a smaller company. I think we've made good progress. You see it in the numbers. At the same time we're
taking cost down, we're simplifying what we do so that we can be more effective at serving the Allstate customers and
the Allstate agencies. We're not through the transition yet with Lincoln Benefit Life. We still have a good year or so of
work to do to get that behind us, but I expect to see us continue to work hard to manage our expenses so that we can
continue to deliver really strong operating results.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: And Bob, I'd just add one other point, as part of corporate overhead, I prefer to call it
corporate value add.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Thank you. Tom, you anticipated my follow-up and gave a partial answer to the question that
I was going to ask, which is, on the PC [property-casualty] side, you're seeing solid expense ratio improvements. Going
forward, are we likely to see any underwriting improvement more likely to come from the expense ratio than the loss
ratio given that you're saying you're trying to move rates up in line with loss cost growth?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I'll let Matt answer it for, of course, our biggest business, which is the Allstate agency
piece. I would just point out, as it relates to Esurance, the expense ratio is dependent on how aggressively we want to
grow the business and how much advertising we're doing.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Bob, it's Matt. Thanks for your question. We try to manage both components. I wouldn't
say that we're trying to use one lever over the other lever. I think we have to be conscious of and monitor and manage
both the loss cost and expense side of the house.
As Tom mentioned, now that we're in growth mode, it gives us the flexibility of making some investments for the
long-term. It gives us the ability to leverage our scale and efficiency. It gives us the ability to do some things, some of
the work we're doing now in continuous improvement, to really go through some of our processes, really make sure
they're as efficient, effective and customer-focused as possible. That will help us leverage our scale and size. That will
help us be more efficient. And so my expectation and the team's expectation is that we will be diligent on both
components of the combined ratio and not look to just use one lever versus the other.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Bernstein. Your question, please.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. So listen, I wanted to switch gears a
bit and talk a bit about growth. You guys have come out of a number of years of stabilizing the business and shrinking
volumes in some of your lines you've been growing for the past year. Longer term, really interested in what you guys
can do to get more leverage out of the core Allstate agency platform. It sounds, from your presentation this morning,
that it sounds like you're starting to add agents again. Curious if that's new head count in agencies, of new principals?
And also, you've done a lot, I think, to reposition the organization to focus more on cross-selling and trying to leverage
the benefits package and things like that. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense, broadly, of what you're doing? And
then for big picture, whether these are the sorts of things that can help you maintain share or whether any of them are
material to allow you to actually begin to grow unit volume, say, in excess of household formations or something like

that?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Let me start with the last part and Matt can give you the specifics on the Allstate
agency piece. So our overall plan to increase share of the business is really focused on having unique customer value
propositions for each segment. And so Matt has a unique customer value proposition for those people who want local
advice in a branded product. He can talk about the things he's doing to make that resonate, which includes many of the
things that you mentioned.
At the same time, we look at both share of revenue and policies as well as share of profits. So as you know, the overall
industry return in the property-casualty business, broadly defined, including commercial and personal lines, is about
7%. We'd like to continue to maintain our attractive returns and have a greater share of that than we do the top line. We
believe we can grow both with our differentiated proposition. And Matt'll talk about specifically what he's doing. And
that business is building momentum. The flywheel's turning on that one.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Yeah, good morning, Josh. Thanks for your question. As you noted, there's been a fairly
strong emphasis on getting the Allstate agency force growing again and getting the entire Allstate brand business
growing again. So we look at it in a couple of different categories and we refer to capacity building, capability building
and activity creation. And so on the capacity building we are, in fact, increasing points of presence, points of
distribution presence, both EAs [exclusive agents] and licensed sales professionals. So we do have a fairly significant
and aggressive campaign to grow the Allstate agency force, but it is not just putting on numbers. It's putting on quality
agencies in strategically deployed areas where we're underpenetrated and we believe that there's extra market potential.
And we will continue to do that fairly aggressively because it's working for us.
We're doing that in areas where we have not historically been able to penetrate and we're using new and fairly creative
methods of doing that, including the Allstate auto dealer program, where we place Allstate agencies in car dealerships,
which in the heartland especially is enabling us to service a very wide geographic area in a very efficient way.
And we're also using what was formerly the Allstate direct group in a support mode for the Allstate agencies. We call it
Extra Hands. And so we are deploying that large call center force to create additional capacity for the agencies both
after hours, weekends and then additionally for overflow when they're capacity constrained during the day. So in the
capacity creation, lots of things going on that we think create long-term, sustainable growth capacity.
On the capability side, Tom has mentioned, I think on several calls, our push to create an advisory capability within the
Allstate agency and grow that. So we refer to it as Trusted Advisor. It's our initiative to focus the Allstate agency force
on more advisory and service functions and less transactional functions, where we believe their differentiation stands
through to the customer base, where we think that they provide extra value, where we de-commoditize insurance and
do not accept the fact that auto or homeowner insurance is merely a pricing play that's truly just a commodity. We don't
believe that and so we're spending a lot of energy and effort building the advisory capability within our Allstate agency
force from a technology perspective, from a service perspective, information perspective, process and marketing
perspective. You'll see a lot of our recent marketing and our agent recruiting materials are very focused on the Trusted
Advisor piece.
And on the activity side we've spent a lot of energy and effort improving our close rates, improving quote activity,
improving retention through customer focused experience work, and other things to improve our relationships with our
customers and retain them for a longer period of time. So on the activity side we think we've been quite successful with
our broadening the target, with our quote generation, and you have seen how that's flowed through in the auto results.
On the home side, as Tom mentioned, the deceleration in the decline in homeowners is just accelerating, so we are
flattening out and positioning to grow there as well. And as Tom has mentioned many times, our goal there has been to
grow in a very disciplined manner so that the volatility of that line is still acceptable for our shareholders, our
customers and for the corporation. And we think we've been pretty successful in that.
If you just look at the last eight quarters, we've had eight consecutive quarters with a recorded combined ratio under
100 and during that time we had $2.1 billion of underwriting income at a combined ratio of 83.1, despite $2.5 billion in
cash. That's a fairly significant event. That's a fairly significant accomplishment and that has given us the confidence to

begin growing the homeowners line again, in a thoughtful and disciplined manner. And when we look at that and we
look at the underlying combined ratio during that same eight-quarter periods, was 63.2. And as we've said multiple
times, our goal is to deliver low 60s combined ratio in the homeowners business and we did that in the period that
included Superstorm Sandy and some with worst winter weather we've seen in quite a while.
So the last part of your question, which was the ability to cross-sell: you've seen an uptick in our other personal lines
business. You saw that in 2013 that line was declining. In 2014 we began growing again in that. Most of that growth is
driven by renters and condo, which we think are very important to creating long-term relationships with our customers
and enabling cross-sell of other products, including auto.
It probably would have been faster had it not been for the decline in the involuntary auto piece of that line. And as you
know, the involuntary auto is what we get depending upon whether other auto carriers, specifically in New York and
New Jersey, accept higher risk customers. And lately they've accepted more customers. We've had less involuntary auto
and so that has slowed down the growth in other personal lines.
But overall, we feel quite good about our ability to serve all the needs of our customers. We have stopped really
referring to it as cross-sell and refer to it as providing household solutions to meet the needs of our customers. So we're
not so interested in trying to acquire a customer and then push another product on them, but to acquire a customer and
meet all of their needs and the needs of their households with our full product portfolio. So we feel quite good about
our positioning for growth and our ability to sustain that growth over the long-term.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Oh, thank you, Matt. That's really pretty comprehensive. I appreciate it. I guess maybe a
high level question for Tom. You've increasingly given more visibility in your communications to all of us to talking
about telematics. And you mentioned the strategic investments here today. I'm wondering if you can give us some color
on how you guys' thinking about your go-to-market strategy is evolving in Esurance and Allstate? And, big picture, is
this something that's going to be a growth engine for you guys or is it more a opportunity to increase your connectivity
with customers and something we should basically look for as a benefit to, say, retention, for example?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Well, it's a good question. I would say that the connected car space is developing
rapidly. We're right in the middle of it and it's hard to determine exactly where it will come out. But I can give you the
three components that we're working on. So first and most importantly, being able to be connected with our customers
helps us get more accurate pricing on their behalf. And as we've talked about in the past, we're making estimates as to
what an individual customer should have. We've been very good at that and that's given us a competitive advantage;
you can see that in the homeowner results that Matt was talking about. Knowing how a specific person drives gives us
the ability to do an even better job and we can provide them a 10% to 30% discount if in fact they connect with us. And
it's every bit as powerful as credit, so we're actively and aggressively working to expand that portion of our business.
Secondly, we're working to improve the driving experience. So we have a number of features that we're developing,
which improve somebody's driving experience, which takes their relationship with us, potentially, beyond auto
insurance. We don't know where that will exactly come out yet. We are investing aggressively in it, to Bob
Glasspiegel's point. And what Matt said was, look, we invest where we want to invest and we cut cost where we think
it's not really adding customer value. In that component of our telematics offering, we're investing aggressively in
trying to decide what are the number of alternatives. We've launched some new features last quarter on teen driving and
we'll continue to roll out new features to better the driving experience.
The last component of our offering is how do we best utilize and monetize some of the data that will be created from
that connection on behalf of our customers? And we're collecting billions of miles of traffic data and all kinds of other
data: how cars work, what they work, what they're like in different weather conditions. And that is the most nascent of
our efforts. It's not an area where we have a traditional source of expertise in monetizing data. We're obviously very
good at using data and we make a lot of money by monetizing it on behalf of our shareholders. How we help other
people use that data and how we capture that revenue source on behalf of the company is yet to be determined. So it is
both more accurate pricing, better experience, which leads in part to retention, but we also think may lead to other
revenue streams and then just solely new revenue streams. So it's really all three of those components.

<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Cool. That's a lot to watch for. So thank you guys. Good luck for the summer.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Sure. Thanks. I guess one question I had, bigger picture: homeowners, trending well,
underlyings are good, PIF trends moving in the right direction; auto, underlying was nice and it doesn't seem like, or
from your comments it doesn't sound like, it was a one-off; other personal lines, growing, looks like low 80s underlying
there; and then Esurance is improving. So I guess I'm trying to understand, your 87 to 89 combined, as a target, it
would seem that we're on a glide path to come in below that unless I'm missing something. Can you comment on how
we should think about that? Thanks.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Sure, Michael. First, of course, as you point out, we give an operating range of a
couple of points for the year at the beginning of the year because we want you all to have some confidence that that's
where we think the business will come out. And this year we picked 87 to 89, which was a point lower than the range
we had last year, which was reflective of our team here's confidence in all the metrics you just talked about.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Right.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: So for the first six months, I would point out, you're right, we're slightly below that in
terms of the underlying combined ratio, towards the lower end. But as you also know, frequency can bounce around a
good point in any period of time so we don't feel any need to change that range. We don't do it to try to help people do
operating EPS calculations; we do it to give you a sense for how good we feel about the business. We still feel good
about the business. We think 87 to 89 generates really attractive returns and we can grow in that range. So we don't
have any plans to change it at this point. What I would take the opportunity to do sales message, because all things
you've talked about, that means the valuation should be a much higher multiple of book.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: That's fair. I guess the other question I had was just, so do you guys calculate an industry
loss estimate for 2Q just across the country? Because it looks like you guys are at about $900 million, just over that. I
look at some industry loss estimates that show that 2Q was a relatively light quarter. Can you try to help us try to
square that? Is it where you're located or maybe just a conservative view of where losses may end up? Just trying to
square those.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Are you talking about auto and home?
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Yeah, so cat losses for the second quarter, $930 million. It looks like industry loss
estimates are somewhere in the $6 billion to $7 billion range, and that's commercial, personal, across the board,
domestically. So I'm just trying to square that versus your market share.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Yeah, I think I would make two comments. One, it's a little early to figure out where
exactly the industry is, because people are just reporting now and it takes us a while to get the information. Secondly,
we do, obviously, look externally at how our results compare to everybody else, but we break it down. We look in total,
but we're really more concerned about what happens locally.
So this is a local business. We underwrite price, do our agencies. Everything's local and so we would really look and
say, well, how are we doing in Colorado relative to other people in Colorado on all fronts. That would be not just
catastrophes. It would be BI. It would be physical damage work. And we have a number of tools we use to do that;
obviously starting with our pricing, but going all the way through to claims. There are some industry databases we use
on claims.
And I think the summary, I would say, of all that is the machine that we have in place, which is a set of business
processes, disciplines, rewards, recognition, analytics, that help us maintain our profitability in the zones we talk about,
is working. We think it's working well. We see Matt's team is adjusting where they need to adjust. And that has
obviously been true for a long time on auto insurance. You're now seeing that same discipline and set of practices being

applied to the homeowners business. And so we feel good about where we're at relative to the industry.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Great. Thanks. And then just really quickly, Esurance, as your actions continue, looks like
you took mid-single-digit rate. PIF is still in the high teens. What do you expect or what are you hoping to get that to or
when are you hoping to get that to underlying profitability or at least getting that loss back down as close to zero as
possible?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I'll let Don talk about the specifics that they're doing at Esurance. I would tell you,
though, from a capital allocation standpoint, the conversations that Don and I have about that business are, it should
grow as fast as it can, assuming we are earning above our cost of capital on the business that we write. If we're not
getting the right return on it, then we're not interested in growing. The returns on the business we write are well above
our cost of capital, slightly below what we would make in a large existing business like Allstate, which has a huge
legacy book associated with generating...
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Right.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: ...a lot of profitability, but it's got to be profitable, what we do.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Got it.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yeah, there's only a little I can add to that. The reality is: our goal is to run Esurance in a way
where we're economically profitable. What you're looking at is the GAAP profitability, which, of course, is impacted
by the fact that we're expensing the advertising upfront, and there's also a couple of points of investment in other
products and expansion that doesn't necessarily pay off in the quarter as well.
I'm really pleased that the work that Gary and his team have done over the last year or so. The loss ratio is beginning to
pay off. You're beginning to see it in the numbers, with the loss ratio coming down again. So I feel good about where
they are. We'd just like to see them continue to grow. And I don't think we want to put an artificial target of a GAAP
combined ratio, because I think that'll stifle the growth that we're seeing in economic terms right now.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: That's fair. Great, thank you for all the answers, really appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Thank you for taking my call. Good morning. And just first question is on the loss cost trend, if you
look at your slide seven, looks like both from auto and homeowner, the underlying loss trend has been ticking down
from recent elevated levels. So could you give a little bit more color on that? And how do you think about, in general,
the economy, the inflation, and as the economy recovering?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Yeah, good morning, Kai. It's Matt. Well, I'm looking at that – I look at those same two
charts on seven and I look at it as reverting more toward the norm. I don't see it as that much of a directional change. I
think we've had an aberration on the auto side for a couple of quarters. It looks like it's stabilized where it should be and
where it has been historically, and the same on homeowner. So we feel very good about the underlying margin trends in
both of those businesses, as we've been saying.
Historically, we manage this very disciplined. We keep on top of loss cost and we keep on top of expense cost and we
manage it on a micro basis for the benefit of the overall system. So we manage those in each geography and each micro
geography and the result of that is a systemic result that looks the way you see on these charts with the positive
long-term trends.
From the overall economy, if you look at our current severity, we haven't seen that much of a impact from the
inflationary trends. Obviously there's some, but really it's been relatively mild and relatively benign. Most of the
severity fluctuations that we've seen have been a result of age of closures, geographic mix, policy limit shifts, and

things like I've discussed earlier about just backlog of third party subro demands, and things like that.
So, so far the trends have been relatively benign. That being said, it's one of the reasons that we have to stay on top of
taking rate. It's one of the reasons we thought it so important to point out that we have continued to take rate on the auto
side even though it was masked a little bit by the Ontario rate decrease. We believe it's essential that we take rate as
needed on a moderate basis, consistently across the business. It's less disruptive to customers. It's less disruptive to the
agency force. It improves retention and it allows us to stay ahead of any inflationary trends that might occur.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Let me provide a point of clarification on these two charts on page seven, as well.
Obviously, two drivers of profitability are price and loss cost, and we show them to you because we think they're
relevant. Unfortunately, I think sometimes it shifts the focus to just price as a tool to manage profitability.
And let me expound on what Matt just said and give you the example of homeowners. So risk selection, product
design, claims, performances are all equally important to profitability. So if you look at homeowners over the last five
years and you look at our cumulative price increases relative to our competitors, they're not really that much different at
the end of this five-year period. That said; we took a whole bunch of other actions, which give us the confidence that
what we've done is made it sustainable.
So for example, we used to have, at its peak, 7.8 million policies. We now have a little over 6 million. That's 1.8
million. We're down 1.2 million just since 2009. What we did was, went through, re-underwrote the book, decided that
those riskier, underpriced pieces of business, we were no longer going to insure. We moved those to somebody else.
We improved – Matt's got a whole new set of inspection processes going on in terms of the way we look at new
business. We, obviously, use sophisticated technology in claims. And then they've redesigned the product in house and
home. I think you're in – what percentage of the country it is?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: We're in about -
<A>: 31 states.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: I'm sorry?
<A>: 31 states.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: 31 states, and it's a growing percentage of the book of business.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: It's about 12% of our overall book, 85% of our new business writings.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: So all of that stuff is underneath that story. So I would encourage you to think about:
we have to look at these charts and show you price, but price is not the only tool we have to manage profitability. Matt
was talking about that system. It has all of those tools available to it. And the strength of our execution is in being able
to have a leadership that knows how to manage that well.
<Q - Kai Pan>: That's very comprehensive. Thank you for that. Second question is on Encompass. Looks like that's
the only segment that you have year-over-year deterioration in term underlying combined ratio. I see that you're taking
a pricing action, as evidenced in the pace of growth slowing down. Could you talk a little bit more about the
competition in the independent agency channel?
<A>: Sure. Thanks for the question. In Encompass we're focused, as you know, on the mass affluent and so we
compete day-to-day with Met [MetLife], Hanover [The Hanover Insurance Group], Chubb [Chubb Corp.], AIG and
Crestbrook. Right now we see that it's competitive, certainly, but it's not irrational from a pricing perspective. We're
still seeing really solid growth on our package policy. We had 10% quarter-over-quarter in package policy growth,
which now makes up the majority of our book. And we see more room, more elasticity in auto. So if you look at auto,
quarter-over-quarter we're up almost two points in retention. So that tells me we have more room to increase margin in
the back half of the year and we plan to do that to get underlying in line.
With regard to the deterioration you're seeing on the overall underlying of two points, you have some non-cat coded
weather in there. We had a really tough quarter in terms of weather and you have non-cat coded weather. And you see

the impact of a one-time, rather sizeable, premium refund that's driving some of that, too.
So all those things combined are driving that underlying. But overall, we still see room for margin expansion in the
back half of the year and if you look at the investor supplement, you'll see that we take most of our rates in the back
half of the year on Encompass. And so you'll see us earn in even more rate on auto and home as the year progresses.
And we think we have room to do that.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Why don't we do one more question.
Operator
Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my call at the end. Back to Allstate Financial, the
results are just excellent and it's not just on expenses. I noticed the spread of net invest income to interest credit as, after
I take out the impact of Lincoln Benefit, it's also growing, and the benefits to premium ratio has been declining. There's
a lot of good stuff going on there. Can you talk about, not just the efficiencies but, actually, the underlying profitability
of the business being generated? What's happening?
<A - Don Civgin>: Yeah, happy to do that. I do feel good about the overall results at Allstate Financial; operating
income, obviously, at $165 million, given the size of our business today, is a terrific result. We're hitting on a lot of
cylinders, as you've pointed out. It isn't just expenses. I think benefit spread continues to be nice and stable and we're
seeing good results on that year-over-year. Where we're seeing a really great result year-over-year is investment spread.
So if you just look at the reported numbers, we're up $12 million in investment spread. If you take out LBL, it's actually
$68 million. And so we've talked about that in the past. With the investment strategy we've taken, we are hoping higher
returns. We're expecting high returns. It will come with some volatility and we're prepared for that. But at the moment,
the investment income, benefit spread, expenses; everything has worked well for us and that's why you see the results
you're seeing.
Thomas Joseph Wilson
Okay. Thank you all. I know there's a number of calls today, so I'll close it off where we began. This quarter's results
show the benefits of both having a focused strategy and solid execution. The net is growth at attractive returns. Thanks
very much. We'll talk to you next quarter.
