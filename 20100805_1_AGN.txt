With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. It was another strong quarter for Watson.
Net revenue for the second quarter increased 29% to $875 million. Adjusted net income for the second quarter
increased 22% to 103 million or $0.83 per share and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter increased 26% to 207
million.
Our performance during the quarter was driven by a number of factors including significant generic product
introductions in the U.S., particularly the 100 and 200-milligram strengths of Metoprolol; continued strength in our
overall contraceptive business; the addition of product sales from international markets. And adjusted gross margin
growth of five percentage points in our Global Generics business helped round out a solid performance in our Global
Generics segment.
In our Global Brands business, the highlights include greater than 25% sequential increase in prescriptions in the
second quarter for RAPAFLO and a greater than 20% increase in prescriptions for Gelnique. We expect both products
will remain important contributors to our Global Brand business over the longer term.
We also saw the best segment contribution ever from our ANDA distribution business. It delivered a 24% increase in
net revenues, driven by new product launches in the industry.
While delivering strong financial results, we also invested in supporting future growth. Investment in R&D was up
49% to 44.6 million for generic R&D, and up 36% to 17.2 million for brand R&D. We announced a significant number
of patent challenges in the U.S. with 6 new Paragraph IV filings in the quarter, bringing the number to 12 year-to-date.
We currently have over 110 ANDAs pending at the U.S. FDA and over 900 dossiers pending outside of the U.S.
We also took significant steps to expand both our brand product portfolio and our brand product pipeline. Trelstar
six-month is our newest addition to the portfolio and the recent launch has been met with enthusiasm due to its unique
attributes, including low needle pain and no need for refrigeration.
Also on June 7, the FDA Advisory Committee on reproductive health voted unanimously in favor of approval of HRA's
next generation emergency contraceptive product currently marketed in Europe as ellaOne. We remain optimistic that

this product will be approved this year. Additionally, we have a novel oral contraceptive pending FDA approval and we
expect to hear about that application by the end of the third quarter. We have not forecasted any sales for these two
contraceptives in 2010.
We recently completed enrollment for the Phase 2 study for Uracyst for cystitis. The study will be completed by the fall
and we anticipate results later this year. If the data is positive, we will look to initiate a Phase 3 study in 2011.
Following the close of the quarter, we completed acquisition of CRINONE'S progesterone gel product line from
Columbia. We immediately began marketing CRINONE to infertility clinics and will be expanding promotion to
ob/gyns with our institutional and women's health field forces in the coming months. We expect to bring more than
three times the previous promotional effort to bear on this product.
Columbia's Phase 3 clinical trial for the prevention of preterm birth is fully enrolled and results are expected later this
year. We are hopeful that the results will support the filing of an NDA in 2011. And lastly, we announced a worldwide
licensing agreement with Itero Biopharmaceutics for their rFSH product currently in preclinical development for the
treatments of infertility. This product leverages our world class resources at Eden Biodesign in our Salt Lake City
facility. We expect to be able to develop this product in a cost affective way.
Now I'd like to provide some color on our international business. With the acquisition of Arrow, we gained a strong
foothold in a number of countries and gained some terrific U.S. pipeline assets like generic Lipitor, Pulmicort and
XOPENEX. Since the beginning of the year, we have launched a number of new products in various markets, the
largest opportunity of which was generic Lipitor in Canada. While the market for this product was more competitive
than originally anticipated, it is an important product to have in Canada.
It's important to remember, as you follow our international business, that Arrow was largely a decentralized
organization and they initially build their commercial infrastructure with many in-licensed products. We have made
significant progress toward centralizing the organization, enhancing the management structures, balancing the product
and development portfolios with the emphasis on manufacturing our own products globally and filing as many Watson
products as possible into these markets.
We've had three key goals for each market. First, the structuring the existing commercial operations in that market to be
agile, efficient and profitable. Second, we are looking to expand the depth of our product offerings and total market
share in each market. Third, and longer term, we look to enhance our base business by shifting the balance from
in-licensed products to our own manufactured products and creating a strong pipeline with significant product launches
for the future.
While we have a lot of work to do. I couldn't be more pleased with the assets that we purchased and the progress that
we've made thus far, and I'm excited for the future of this business given the many opportunities that I see on the
horizon.
Finally, yesterday we announced that Siggi Olafsson has joined us as our new Executive Vice President for Global
Generics Division effective September 1. Siggi most recently served as CEO of Actavis Group, where he was
responsible for overseeing Actavis's 2.4 billion global pharmaceutical business with operations in more than 40
countries. Siggi brings tremendous global experience to our team and I couldn't be more pleased to have him join us.
Siggi will succeed Tom Russillo, who will retire effective at the end of 2010. I would just like to say that Tom played
an instrumental role in the integration of the Arrow assets and in identifying strategies for Watson's global growth.
Before that, Tom was critical to Watson's global supply chain improvement efforts as well as a driving force in
revitalizing our U.S. generics R&D efforts. I would like to thank him for all his efforts and wish him all the best in this
retirement. Over the next months, Tom and Siggi will work together to continue our globalization efforts and begin the
next phase of maximizing our current commercial footprint and capitalizing on additional opportunities to expand into
these markets.
So in summary, we delivered strong financial results during the quarter, while continuing to take steps necessary to
capitalize on numerous opportunities to grow our business globally.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Todd for some more color on the financials. Todd?
R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the second quarter of 2010,
consolidated net revenue was 875 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year period. Net revenue for our Global
Generics division was 571 million, up 42% on a year-over-year basis. Ex-U.S. net revenues were 111 million.
Sequentially international net revenues were essentially flat as unit growth was offset by lower pricing and the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. generics revenues and margins remain strong due to relatively stable
pricing and higher sales of our extended release products, including Metoprolol ER and Diltiazem LA. Oral
contraceptive sales were up 12% over last year to 97 million.
Adjusted gross margin for the Generics division was 48.6%, up 4.9 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. The
increase in adjusted gross margin reflects a continuation of recent trends including higher sales of extended release
products at favorable margins, relatively stable pricing for our U.S. base portfolio, and lower year-over-year unit
manufacturing costs as a result of cost saving from our global supply chain initiative and slightly higher unit production
levels.
Moving to the Brand division, their revenue was 104 million, down 10% from the prior year period. Product sales were
77 million, down 21% year-over-year. The decrease reflects the loss of Ferrlecit which was partially offset by increased
sales of RAPAFLO, ANDRODERM and infeb. Brand other revenue was 27 million for the quarter, an increase of 51%
as a result of outlicensing revenue for two legacy brand products. For the full year, we expect brand other revenue to be
approximately $80 million.
Brand adjusted gross margin was 77.2%, down from 80.9% in the second quarter of last year reflecting the loss of
Ferrlecit. Brand gross margin was up over 4 percentage points sequentially from 73% in the first quarter, reflecting the
increase in other revenue and lower sales of products supplied to third parties under contract manufacturing
arrangements.
Finally, net revenues from our Distribution segment was 201 million, up 24%, or 40 million, from the prior year period
due to higher third party product launches and higher brand sales. Distribution segment adjusted gross margin for the
quarter was 16.1%, up from 15.1% last year, mainly as a result of favorable product mix in the quarter.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses, consolidated R&D for the second quarter was 61.8 million, up 45%
compared to the prior year period due to the addition of our international business and increased investment in generic
and brand R&D. Generic R&D increased due to the higher investment in product development. Brand R&D increased
as a result of Eden as well as higher clinical spending including the initiation of a Phase 3 study during the quarter.
For the full year 2010, we expect total R&D spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of 260 to 275 million. SG&A
for the second quarter was 157 million, an increase of 28 million over the prior year period. The increase is mainly as a
result of our international business, higher legal and personnel costs, and an increase in bad debt of 5.8 million related
to our distribution business. The increase in bad debt was a result of the bankruptcy filing of KemRx. For 2010, we
expect our SG&A spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of 620 to 650 million.
Amortization for the second quarter was 43 million, up from 22 million last year, reflecting higher amortization as a
result of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be approximately 175 million.
Our GAAP tax rate in the second quarter was 28%, down from 42% in the second quarter of last year. The decrease
was due to certain nonrecurring tax benefits associated with the Arrow acquisition. These one-time tax benefits are
excluded from our adjusted cash earnings. For 2010, we now expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of
32 to 34%. On an adjusted cash basis, we continue to expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36 to 38%.
On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization, earnings for the second quarter was $0.83 per share, up 14%
from $0.73 per share in the prior year quarter.

Also excluded from the GAAP results for adjusted cash basis reporting were 8.8 million in acquisition and licensing
related charges and 15.5 million in costs associated with our global supply chain initiative. Acquisition and licensing
related charges for the quarter include preferred stock accretion of 3.8 million, a 3 million adjustment related to our
torvastatin contingent liability and integration costs of 2 million.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.57. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was 207 million, up 26% compared
with the prior year period. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was 74 million.
We ended the quarter with 1.2 billion of debt, and 236 million in cash and marketable securities. We have 50 million
outstanding on our revolver, leaving 450 million of undrawn capacity. At the end of the quarter, our debt to adjusted
EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times and our debt to capital ratio improved to 28.4% from 32.5% at year end.
We were pleased with our accomplishments this year. We're well positioned financially and have a proven track record
of delevering after major acquisitions as recognized by our ratings upgrades in the quarter by Moody's and S&P. We're
well positioned to capitalize on a number of opportunities for future growth.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Paul for an update of the 2010 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Todd. I will now give you a little guidance on the rest of 2010. Our estimate for full year net revenue is
approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our Global Generics segment revenue, including our international revenues, to
be between 2.25 and $2.35 billion. Turning to the assumptions for our U.S. generics business, we now have one
additional competitor in Metoprolol, which we estimate will have a modest pricing impact and a modest unit decline.
We now expect no competition on generic Micro-K in 2010. Our U.S. forecast does include a modest contribution from
some patent challenges. However, we have not included any impact for generic CONCERTA or generic LOVENOX.
On the international front, we are continuing to experience many positive dynamics including unit growth, and we, as I
said earlier, have more than 900 pending dossiers outside of the U.S. As with all players in these markets, we have been
experiencing the impact of lower pricing, greater than anticipated changes in government regulations and the impact of
foreign currency. While we are very encouraged by the growth of the international operations, there are many moving
pieces and we currently expect our international revenues in the second half to be higher than the first half, weighted
toward the fourth quarter.
Conforming to industry practice, we have determined that there is limited value in a separate regional revenue forecast.
We will, of course, continue to provide visibility on the performance of the business by reporting international net
revenue on a quarterly basis.
On the brand side of the business, we expect net revenues to be between 440 million and 460 million for the year. The
assumptions now include a third quarter launch of our value brand of Ferrlecit. With the ANDA distribution business,
we anticipate revenues between 760 million and $800 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA of 820 to 850 million and
adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.30 to $3.45.
In summary, then, we experienced a great quarter and a great half year. We experienced more than 20% growth in
revenue, adjusted cash net income and adjusted EBITDA. We continued to launch new generic products and expand
our portfolio of brand products. We are making notable progress in growing our international business and expanding
our global footprint. We're continuing to drive efficiencies resulting in continued strong profitability. And finally, we
continue to invest in R&D, patent challenges and business development.
As you can see, we are making significant strides in every one of the initiatives we set out to accomplish in 2010, and I
couldn't be more excited about the prospects for the future of Watson.
So with that, let's open it up for questions. Patty?

Thanks, Paul, and Lori, we can open it up for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Silver of Barclays Capital.
<Q - Richard Silver>: Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Rich.
<Q - Richard Silver>: Just on the Brand business, on your last quarter conference call you mentioned some positive
developments in terms of managed care with RAPAFLO and Gelnique. Can you give us update on that front in terms
of formulary access and whether we should expect any change in terms of penetration, noticeable change in penetration
– noticeable change in penetration in the coming quarters?
<A>: Yeah. Great question. For RAPAFLO particularly, Q2 was kind of a pivotal timeframe because it was the time
when Flomax had now gone from brand to a generic affected product. With that what most of the managed care plans
were doing was waiting to see whether in fact the brand company was going to chase the generic price down or
whether they were just going to allow generics to come into the marketplace and hold the brand price. That's what they
did.
So Flomax was essentially then moved to tier 3; generics occupied tier 1, and allowed us an opportunity to occupy tier
2 in many of these plans. Most of that negotiation had been done during the fourth and first quarter of last year and this
year. We were just waiting for the event. And so when that event occurred what it allowed us to do is now finalize
those activities, get those programs in place and what you're seeing in second and third quarter -- and will see in third is
the pull-through that's related to those plans. So yes, you should expect to see some incremental growth on RAPAFLO
due to some better managed care positions.
Gelnique is just a general slug it out attempt to get additional placement in managed care. Our placement is actually
pretty good right now. We occupy between tier 2 and the non-encumbered tier 3 most of the major plans. We're in a
pretty good position there.
<Q - Richard Silver>: Do you have the sales numbers for those two products? I may have missed that.
<A>: No, we don't go in – we have not provided individual sales numbers on our brands.
<Q - Richard Silver>: Okay. And then just shifting to CONCERTA, any update in terms of your discussions with the
FDA, particularly given the April panel meeting?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think, Rich, just to recap for everybody what we've
done – where we are at with CONCERTA is we did win the patent case; the mandate has issued. If in fact there is 180
days of exclusivity, it is now running.
The panel, as you say, was a question about Partial AUC and we have provided data to the FDA to answer the question
about Partial AUC. We know the FDA is reviewing that data, and as of now, we have no additional update. But that's –
I guess that's where we're at.
<Q - Richard Silver>: Okay; thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Hey, guys; thanks for the question. Paul, just looking at your international business, the run
rate so far around, I guess, $430 million. Is the low end of the previous 500 to 550 still realistic? And then, can you just
remind us where us the exposure in that international business lies?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Randall, on a going-forward basis, as I said in
my prepared remarks, we're not going to give guidance on a regional basis. So what I think and what I did say, though,
was, we do expect the run rate to go up in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year, weighted to
the fourth quarter.
With respect to -- I think your question was with respect to...
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: The regionals...
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: ...those markets or areas where there would be
concern, the big countries for us are Canada, UK and France, and Australia. We did see the Canadian pricing change;
that happened faster than anticipated. The rest of the provinces followed the -- Ontario a little quicker than I think
everyone anticipated. So we did see a decline in Canada, overall projections for Canada, in revenues. Our unit numbers
are up, but our revenues are going to be down there as compared to what we originally projected.
UK, we had stronger than expected pricing competition across many of the molecules. So we did see reduction there.
And in France, that market has stabilized and unit growth is helping to increase there. In Australia, Australia has been
more of a question of our relationship with Sigma. As you may or may not know, Arrow has a longstanding
relationship with Sigma, the distribution company there, where we supply products to Sigma for distribution. Sigma
had a bit of a hiccup in the first quarter -- first two quarters really in Australia and that did affect our revenues a bit in
Australia. But we do expect a pickup in the second half.
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: But Paul, I guess, most of the challenges: would they be reflected in this current 2Q number
at this point?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Okay, good. And then just one quick follow-up. On the branded side the outlicensing of the
two branded products, is that fair to assume that's ongoing contribution that we should expect to continue? It's not a
one-time payment.
<A - R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: This is Todd. It's really a one-time item.
There will be ongoing contribution but at a much lower level.
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Okay. Is there anything else that we're missing then, just thinking about the back half
branded outlook which implies a pretty sharp drop. I understand RAPAFLO is performing well. Is there anything else
that you guys have factored in in terms of new launches, that could provide a boost?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think – yeah, I think clearly, Randall, the
issue there is the generic Ferrlecit product. We have anticipated for some time the approval of that product. We're still
working with the agency and our partner's still working with the agency to get approval. We do anticipate approval in
the third quarter, and moving people through or moving the FDA through that process is often a challenge. We also will
be expecting a contribution from CRINONE in the second half that wouldn't -- that wasn't there in the first half.
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Okay. And Ferrlecit will be in the branded segment. Is that -- that's fair?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Right. We're going to sell it as a value brand.
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Schott>: Great. Thanks. First question was just on generic Toprol. Can you just elaborate a little bit
more on the dynamics you're currently seeing and expecting to see as it relates to price and volume, and does your
guidance assume any further competition in that market in 2010? And just had one follow-up from there.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Yeah, Chris, our guidance does not assume any
additional competition other than Wockhardt and Parr at the moment for 2010. We've not heard of any new competitors
entering, and Sandoz has made it pretty clear that they don't expect to be back in 2010. So based on that information,
that's what we have in the model.
Regarding current competition, I think the market is settling down after the entry of Wockhardt. I think everything was
pretty good the way everybody handled the situation. I think we feel very comfortable with our current projections and
where we're at with Metoprolol. We've -- prior to Wockhardt's entry we were looking around a 50% market share for
basically all four streams. We hadn't quite achieved that yet, in the 100 and 200, but we were expecting to get there. We
do expect some modest price decline and some unit decline, modest unit decline, but not anything terribly significant.
<Q - Christopher Schott>: Great. Follow-up question was on business development in international markets. Can you
just give us a little bit of color of what geographies you view as most attractive at this point? And it seems as though
we've got a lot of international markets on the generic side that are kind of in flux right now given overall budgetary
pressures facing a lot of countries. How does that factor – does this make you at all consider backing off further
business development plans or investments in ex-U.S. markets? So just get a little bit better sense of how some of these
geographies really evolve. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Actually no, Chris. I actually think this presents a
great opportunity. A lot of companies are revaluating their ability to operate in these markets and that created an
opportunity for Watson who is committed. We are committed to growing our global business, and so for us it creates a
buying opportunity.
And so we have been actively pursuing opportunities across multiple markets. We have not singled out any particular
region or market that we want to be focused on; what we've said is we want to look at our European businesses, try to
help support them by increasing their footprint and their magnitude within each of the countries. We've also said we've
been looking at Asia Pacific, the Asia Pacific region. Since we have such a strong presence already in that region, we'd
like to fill that region out. And finally, we'd look to emerging markets in South America, in Turkey and other places to
also fill out. So a little bit will be driven by opportunity, what opportunities present themselves, but we have no
particular country that we are focused on other than what the opportunities are presented.
<Q - Christopher Schott>: And just in terms of that opportunity, I mean, are you starting to see better prices in the
market given some of those changing dynamics or...
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You mean pricing and products, or you mean pricing
--
<Q - Christopher Schott>: In terms of assets that you would look to pursue.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think multiples are probably coming down. It sort of
depends on the asset. But multiples are moving in the direction -- in favor of the acquirer.
<Q - Christopher Schott>: Great; thanks very much.
<A - Patricia L. Eisenhaur, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications>: Thanks, Chris.

Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert of Bank of America.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Hello. Good morning. My first question is about M&A also. Can you comment more
specifically on your interest in getting much larger in Australia, given press reports, and to what extent are you
interested in helping to consolidate the U.S. branded specialty pharma industry? We keep waiting for more of that to
happen, but haven't really heard that featured in your commentary as it applies to M&A in the past.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I'll answer the first question. On the branded
M&A side, I mean, we are probably looking more – and I have said this quite frequently -- we are probably looking
more for product opportunities and pipeline opportunities and biologic opportunities than we are for growing into
another therapeutic category. We are very pleased with the two categories that we're focused on -- urology and female
health. There's a lot of things to do there. We've just begun to scratch the surface on what can be done. And then on the
biologics front, you saw us sort of make our big – our first big move with FSH that we announced with Itero this
quarter. So I think that's probably our focus for brand M&A for the U.S.
As commenting on any specific international acquisition opportunities, I'm going to decline to do that, only to say that
we continue to look for opportunities that are presented. And to the extent it makes sense for Watson to make a move
into those markets, we'll be there.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: And then -- thanks, Paul -- and then one follow-up on -- specific pipeline question on Lidoderm.
Why do you think the FDA did not require clinical trials in this case even though they have in many cases for other
topically acting products? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't know. I think we certainly have satisfied the
requirements – we believe we satisfied the requirements that the FDA set out for Lidoderm. I don't – I think the FDA
must have concluded that a clinical study was not required.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: All right. Fair enough. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem of Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David Amsellem>: Thanks. Just a couple. I joined late so you might have answered this on the progesterone
assets. Just remind us what CRINONE and PROCHIEVE are currently annualizing at in terms of sales. And since you
have a bigger sales reach than Columbia, by how much do you think you can grow those products without the
additional label expansion in preterm birth?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: This is Fred Wilkinson. CRINONE sales last year reported by Columbia were just
under 18 million. The indication is for supplementation and replacement of progesterone in all infertility treatments, so
that the IVF and IUI and all the other different infertility approaches that are generally done by either the ob/gyn or the
infertility specialist.
We have not given individual product forecasts for 2010 within the brand business. But suffice it to say, I think
Columbia had 24 representatives; we have 55 folks that are right now out in front of the infertility specialists, and
another 130, 135 people that will be attacking the ob/gyns. So substantially larger effort will be put behind CRINONE
than Columbia could have afforded to do. That's essentially the purpose of the deal.

Secondly, we're looking forward to the result in preterm labor, which is -- to remind you, they are at the end of their –
will be ending their trial in November, December timeframe, announcing top line results sometime around that time,
with the goal of successful filing an NDA in early first quarter.
<Q - David Amsellem>: Okay. And then question on the international markets. I mean, you talked about new countries
that you've entered like Poland or Turkey -- or you're about to enter. Can you give us some color on the pricing
dynamics in the new markets that you're about to enter, particularly how they stack up versus other markets in Europe
that have been subject of concern like Spain and the UK?
<A - Thomas Russillo>: This is Tom Russillo. Poland market has experienced some price pressures, but that seems to
have stabilized right now. We have just increased our presence in Poland. We are in a joint venture which we now have
a controlling interest in. And we will be launching a lot more of Watson products in that market. So we're very
enthused about that. Finland, we just opened our own office in Finland. So we are now covered in all of the Nordic
countries, so we're optimistic about increased sales there.

Your next question comes from the line of David Maris of CLSA Credit.
<Q - David Maris>: Credit Agricole. But, Paul, couple of questions.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Maris>: How are you? First on the recent Lovenox approval, and after looking at the documents that come
out about it, are there any implications for the industry or for Watson that you think have changed your opinion on how
to do R&D for the more difficult to characterize products? Do you think that Momenta has some sort of special ability
in characterization, that you need to develop a similar ability or, no, this is a unique situation? And then my follow-up
is on Lipitor.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Speaking for Craig Wheeler, I think he would say
they have a special ability. And they certainly -- I got to congratulate them on their work. But I think -- I would first
start by saying I'm pleased that the FDA seems to be moving on these applications that have been pending for quite
some time. And that's a good sign. We hope to get them to move on some other applications that have been pending for
a long time.
As to any new level or new bar, look, I think the FDA has always wanted us to characterize products and show that we
know what the brand is doing, so that we can prove that the generic is going to be equivalent.
I think that Watson has the capability to do that kind of activity, and we've proven it with Concerta and I think we'll
continue to -- and we certainly have done so with our, we believe, with our generic Ferrlecit application. So I think we
have those capabilities as well. And if the FDA has raised the bar, I applaud them and we are ready to meet that bar or
that level, and as long as those applications come through, I couldn't be more happy.
<Q - David Maris>: Okay. Thank you. My follow-up is on Lipitor. Can you walk us through what you think the
different ways it could play out and what your opinion is the most likely way that it will play out?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Well, that's a good question. Currently, our
projections, our out-year projections, assume that we will launch the product in November of next year, and Ranbaxy
with be there with a generic as well. And we will have two competitors for the first 180 days, and that post day 181,
there will be additional entrants but not a flood of entrants.

And that assumption is based on the fact that Pfizer continues to litigate against a number of companies and there are
patents that protect Lipitor well out into 2018, I think. So some -- so people have to get through the patent fights before
they can launch the product.
As most people know, there is some possibility that Ranbaxy may not be there on day one. And if they're not, then we
will launch the product as on the date certain, and we will be able to supply the entire generic need for the market. So
that's our anticipation. But again, our main focus is what I said, first point that or the first – my first discussion is I
expect that we will have a competitor with Ranbaxy in November 2011.

Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman of UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Marc. How are you?
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Can we go back to this other revenue benefit? I just want to make sure I understand, did you
take two products, this Monodox and Cordran, sell them, so now the sales are no longer going to be booked in the
brand line and you booked a one-time gain in the quarter in the revenue line? I want to try to understand what happened
in the quarter and then what's the ongoing impact.
And then second of all, in the international generics business, what was the FX impact in the quarter and how much is
FX clipping from your kind of sales forecast in the second half of the year versus the other issues that are going on over
there?
And then one other question. Paul, you mentioned Paragraph IVs actually in the numbers, in the guidance this year. Is
that a change for you? Is this something you're going to change going forward? What P IVs are in the numbers?
Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Todd, you go first.
<A - R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'll start out with the brand revenue. This
is something that we outlicensed these products in 2005. We've been recognizing revenue since 2005 on them. We did
have a higher level of revenue related to payments that we received -- option payments we received. We'll continue to
supply, over the next three years, one of the products. So there still will be some revenue recognized related to the –
related to one of the products under the contract manufacturing arrangement.
On your question on the FX, the FX impact in the quarter was 5%. And, Paul, the third...
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The Paragraph IV, it is not a change in guidance
strategy for us. What that is, Marc, as we have said in the past, when we're at a point with a patent challenge where we
believe we are going to be launching a product for whatever reason, we will put that in the model. For example, in
2011, we know we have the approval of Torvastatin, so we'll put that in the model in 2011. It just so happens in the
second half of this year there are two product opportunities that we expect to -- well, we expect to launch in 2011 -- or
2010, and so we have a modest contribution for them, recognizing that there could be challenges in launching the
products. But you asked what the products were. I will tell you; they are FENTORA and YASMIN.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: And just on the FX, when you talk about the -- you are not telling us the international sales
guidance anymore, which is fine, but can you just help us understand -- was it half FX and half European issues as far
as taking the revenues down in the second half of the year in your model, in your thoughts, or how did you think about
that?

<A - R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, in terms of the FX impact, the
impact has been roughly around 5%, and that's what it's forecasted for the rest of the year. So wasn't a dramatic -- that
wasn't a primary driver for our view of full-year international revenue.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, I think to be more blunt about it, I think, you
know, certainly the price declines in those markets were the major driver.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore of Cowen and Company.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Hi, thanks, guys. Just one question on the URACYST commentary, can you just talk about the
development timing, you said you're going to roll in a Phase 3, so maybe, when will we see the most recently
completed study? I know you just completed enrollment, but maybe when will you release that data? And then
potential timing of completion of the Phase 3 and maybe timing of what you're thinking in terms of introduction and
maybe a description of the opportunity? Thanks.
<A>: So Phase 3 – or Phase 2 just completed enrollment. The study itself will functionally finish sometime late in
2010, probably the late November, early December timeframe. It'll take us probably a couple of weeks to cut the data to
get top line results, so sometime near the end of the year we'll know whether we've got positive outcome from the
Phase 2 program.
We sized the program large enough to be able to give us a good indication whether we will have a positive effect in
Phase 3, so this really was a predictive Phase 2 program. We take it into Phase 3; that usually takes several months to
get FDA approval; get their mechanics all established, and I think bottom line is the timing of that would be probably
something where there would be a early-to-mid '13 filing. So we've got several years to go on that.
Now the interstitial cystitis marketplace is one that -- kind of hard to get the data around. It's a very large indication as
far as numbers of people who have been diagnosed with the problem, but there's no current drug that's really effective
in treating it. So most people are essentially on heavy pain meds. And so this would be an opportunity to introduce into
the market that has very much of an unmet need.

Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Couple of them. First one, on the FSH
product obviously you guys had to, Fred, kind of put together your numbers both on the cost side timeline and some
sort of projection for revenue. I'm wondering if you can help us a little bit in thinking about when you can bring
something this to market and what is the total project cost, on one side. And then on the other one, a few words about
the market and what do you see as the potential for something like this and how does it differentiate from the current
products in the market?

Second question. I think you just mentioned FENTORA as a potential launch for this year. Quickly, how do you see the
CP that Cephalon's submitted and the timeline for resolve that issue, because I guess that will gate your ability to come
to market?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: So let me do FSH first and then turn it over on FENTORA. The FSH marketplace is
about -- globally is about a $1.2 billion market, about half of it in the U.S., half of it in Europe. Two competitors in
there which is Serono product and a, I guess a Merck-Serono product now, and a Organon product which is now part of
Pfizer – or Merck, I guess. Who knows where these are anymore. The patents that gate the introduction of a generic are
in the '15-'16 timeframe for both U.S. and Europe. So the development process for us in an FSH is to essentially get
there before those patents expire.
We have a timeline established; we're right now functionally moving the product over to Liverpool, where our Eden
team will scale up and develop the product. The clinical activities will be done -- completed by the Salt Lake City team,
and then the commercial approach will be utilizing our women's healthcare franchise. So the women's healthcare group
we essentially will have grown sufficiently to be able to manage a product like this in the infertility marketplace. It's a
great combination for what we're doing with CRINONE and it will be essential for us either to build out or to establish
some kind of relationship for marketing this product outside the United States.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: And then so just – if you have a word about the project cost, how much does it cost to bring a
branded product – a follow-on branded product to the market? And just as a side note, there were rumors that the
Merck KGaA fertility business is for sale. I don't know if you guys can comment on this.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We've heard these rumors. I think that's probably the
only comment I could make.
And I don't think we've put out the cost, but I think people are working with ranges in the 30 to 45, $50 million range
full-in for the development of a biologic.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: That's it?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: At least for a product along this lines, yes, because of the fairly defined clinical
programs; those programs will be defined by what was done by the innovator. And with this particular product, it's
important to remember that this is right now approved as an NDA, not as a BOA.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Oh, I got you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And then, Ronny, I think you asked us about
FENTORA. We have our stay ending in October of this year. We do – we certainly have seen the two citizens' petitions
that have been filed so far by Cephalon. Regarding the first one, we don't believe we run afoul of their argument, so
we'll be submitting data to the agency to support that. We also don't -- so that's the one issue.
The second issue raised in -- or the issue raised in the second CP, the FDA put out a guidance, so clearly they thought
about this beforehand. So once the guidance was issued, it's our position that the FDA carefully considered what they
were going to do and issued a guidance. We met the guidance, so it should be denied. So we will continue to provide
data to the agency as needed but that's where we are at with FENTORA.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: But it's not full, you haven't put the full weight of the product in your guidance.
It's risk-adjusted somehow.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's probably better to be modest.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen of Collins Stewart.
<Q - Louise Chen>: Hi. Just a few questions on generic Lipitor. With respect to Ranbaxy, when do you think they
need to start production in order to be a meaningful supplier of generic Lipitor in 2011? And then do you expect Pfizer
to lower their pricing of branded Lipitor at all to meet the generic drug prices, at least for portion of the market?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: Well, Louise, on the Ranbaxy question, you know, it's a big product. So they will
probably have to start reasonably soon to start making product to handle the demand. But that's really within their
control and they are – will know their own time lines certainly better than I would know.
But with respect to what we are anticipating from Pfizer, I think I said in the past that like any big product, we would
expect a certain amount of defense to be played by the brand companies. We've seen it before in certain closed models,
certain – sometimes in mail order. And so when we looked at the overall – when we look at the overall market, we
assume some of that market wouldn't be available to us because the brand company would go out and lower their price
to be competitive with the generic. So we've made that assumption – we will make that assumption when we build our
models for 2011.
<Q - Louise Chen>: And can you give us any sense of all of what sales of generic Lipitor were in Canada?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: We don't – well, I'll turn it over to Tom.
<A - Thomas Russillo>: We found Canada to be a little bit disappointing because there were six launches of Lipitor,
generic Lipitor, all at the same time. So our sales were probably about half of what we had expected. But we do see
going forward with the movement of Torvastatin to Malta a better price position than we expect in 2011 to have a
better share.

Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur of Needham & Company.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Elliot.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Hey, Paul, how are you?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: I don't know if you provided any updated commentary on pricing erosion trends in the U.S.
generic market, but still seems like with some competitive disruptions and less erosion in the base and your ability to
take increases, that still tracking ahead of prior commentary that full year erosion would be in the high single digit or
roughly 10% range.
<A>: Yeah, Elliot, we didn't talk about that yet. But I agree, our price erosion has been, I guess, less than we
anticipated. We have moved from a double-digit number to a single-digit number for our model. So we're looking now
-- I would say high single digit is probably a safe assumption and that's what we've been using for – what we'll use for
the second half of the year as opposed to a 10% number that we used to use, well, we started with at the beginning of
the year. So price erosion still has – prices still remain reasonably good in the U.S.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Okay. And then wanted to ask a similar line of questioning on the -some of legacy brands, just
looking some -- at the recent pricing maneuvers there. Some of the – the rate of increase has continued to move up and
certainly seeing what – some pretty big pricing increases on products like Oxytrol, and I'm guessing the working
assumption there -- just legacy brands, relatively sticky demand and obviously not much elasticity there to pricing.

<A>: Well, that's certainly true. The legacy brands are -- generally inelastic demand is there. We -- it costs us money to
manufacture them, so we often take prices to recognize that need. But you're correct; there has been -- we have taken
prices in many of our legacy brand products.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chang of CRT capital.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Tim.
<Q - Timothy Chang>: Hey, Paul. I wanted to ask you about the oral contraceptive business. What sort of growth did
you guys record this quarter and sort of how you look at this segment of your generic business heading into next year? I
think Mylan has indicated that they are going to try to get into the oral contraceptive business sometime next year, and
can you comment on the competitive landscape of the oral contraceptive segment?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, Tim. Ever since I've been in the industry it
seems for the last 10 years people have been telling us that the oral contraceptive business is going to be dead because
of competition. And in fact it just doesn't go away. And I think people just sort of miss the point that we have
something like 27, 28 different generic oral contraceptives. And it's hard to get approvals, a, and b, to get 25 to 30
approvals and have a basket of products is not something you can do overnight. Everybody knows the agency is taking
26, 28 months to get approvals done. And these are hard products, so the agency is going to take an extra look at them.
So I guess at the end of the day we just haven't seen the -- we also haven't seen the competition come in as aggressively
and as hard as that was originally anticipated. So our OC numbers are up slightly I think quarter-over-quarter. And I
guess we expect that trend to be -- continue -- not necessarily up but to remain reasonably flat for the second half of the
year.
A lot of times, too, it's the new launches -- our new launches of products that help drive that number. And certainly
products like Next Choice have been very positive for Watson and that also has helped offset any loss of share for the
older brands that -- or the older products that competitors have come in with.
2011 will be -- may be a different story. We'll have to evaluate it at the time we give guidance for 2011. But again, I'm
sort of reluctant to believe that somebody is going to get 30 approvals in a six-month period and be able to be fully
competitive in that market.
<Q - Timothy Chang>: And just one follow-up. How meaningful do you think this new emergency contraceptive, you
had the positive panel review on will be in the marketplace?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think it's going to be a very important product
in the marketplace. It will not be an OTC product, but it is one that gives women additional opportunity -- one of the
hardest things with the current product is getting access to it quickly. This product gives women a couple of extra days
to be able to get the product ,and we're working on marketing strategies to provide that product to women as quickly as
possible. And so, more to come on that, but I do think it's going to be a good product.
<Q - Timothy Chang>: Okay, great. Thanks.
<A - Patricia L. Eisenhaur, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications>: Thanks, Tim.

<Q - Michael Tong>: Good morning, Paul. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on products that you haven't put
into your model. With respect to Lovenox, has your partner given you any indication of where their application stands,
and how confident are they in terms of getting approval? And then with respect to Concerta, following the advisory
panel meeting do you expect the FDA to try to put together some guidance documents for public comment or you think
they will bypass that?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, with Lovenox, our partner, Amphastar, is
managing that application. We do not have a lot of visibility into that application. That is something that they've been
handling. As of now, as I said earlier, we don't have any numbers in for Lovenox for 2010. If that situation changes,
we'll let everybody know. But right now, we don't expect anything for 2010.
On Concerta, I don't believe the agency has to issue a guidance before they rule on our product. They certainly have the
authority to do that without a guidance. But the agency does its own thing. So not sure what they're going to do. They
haven't told us that they're going to issue a guidance before they approve the product, but they also haven't told us that
they won't. So we're going to continue to push them for final approval and go.
<Q - Michael Tong>: Thank you.

Your final question comes from the line of John Boris of Citi.
<Q - John Boris>: Thanks for ...
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Boris>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the results. Paul, you alluded to the pricing
impact being in the high single digit. Does that – can you maybe break that out? Is it worse in Europe or is it better in
Europe or how that compares and contrasts relative to the U.S.?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. In some of the markets in Europe it's
substantially worse. And even in Canada, we saw the 25% reduction in price across the board. And that – not across the
board, but for a lot of the products in Ontario and then again throughout the rest of the provinces. So that was – it is
been greater.
Offsetting, just to remind everybody, offsetting those price declines, though, is certainly market penetration. Generics
are underutilized in many of these markets. France, the utilization rates still is in the 20 to 30% range. If units – these
governments are certainly well served. I understand they're trying to control cost by cutting price, but they're actually
better off by driving substitution. And I think it's the bet of all the generic companies that the governments are going to
realize that and drive substitution. And over time we'll be certainly better off with substitution rates in the 70 and 80%
range, will certainly make up for any product or any cost decline. So we are seeing that dynamic happening in Europe.
<Q - John Boris>: With having a negative 5% impact from foreign exchange, can you maybe provide a little bit better
granularity on the impact on the international business from price and what the volume offset is or the net would be
there?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think we said on a constant currency basis our
numbers were up over the prior quarter 4%. So there was clearly -- you have the FX impact, you have the unit impact,
or well, you have the unit up impact, and you have the dollar decline -- or the revenue decline. So it's hard to put all
those parts together without specifically laying them out. I guess the answer is, John, I can't give you all that detail
because it's a market-by-market analysis. So I guess we'll have to leave it at that.
<Q - John Boris>: All right. And on a couple of product related questions. On Micro-K, were you able to take any
price on Micro-K?

<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No. I think our pricing has been relatively stable.
Micro-K does not have a brand product at the moment, so that product stays pretty much where it's at.
<Q - John Boris>: Okay. And then just on Concerta, you just remind us where you'll manufacture the product, and
then what is the trigger for building launch quantities, or have you started that process yet? Any clarity there would be
useful. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. The manufacturing would be in Florida, and,
like everything else, we will evaluate the launch quantities as we talk and building launch quantities around the time we
get visibility from the FDA.
