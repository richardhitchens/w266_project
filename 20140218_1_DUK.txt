MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy Fourth Quarterly Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At
this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bill Currens. Please, go ahead.
Bill Currens
Thank you, Whitney. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2013 earnings review
and business update. Leading our call is Lynn Good, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer.
Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2
represents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. You should also refer to the
information in our 2012 10-K and other SEC filings concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from
this forward-looking information. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website at
duke-energy.com, and in today's materials.
Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures, to
help you analyze the company's performance and our financial outlook. We have a lot of material to cover today. Lynn
will provide an overview of our key 2013 accomplishments and our key priorities for 2014. And Steve will review our
2013 financial results, introduce our 2014 earnings per share guidance range and discuss our longer-term earnings
growth objectives.
Additionally, we will have commentary on yesterday's announcement that we have begun a process to exit the Midwest
generation business. Our prepared remarks today will be a little longer than normal. We will try to get to as many of
you as possible during the Q&A portion of today's call. For those we're not able to get to, the Investor Relations' team

is available for any follow-up you may have. So, now I'll turn the call over to Lynn.
Lynn J. Good
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2013 was a year of great accomplishments for Duke, our
first full year as a combined company. Our 2012 merger with Progress Energy gives us the unique platform to drive
efficiencies and grow the business. We are pleased with all that has been accomplished over the last year and a half and
also recognized, we still have important work ahead of us. As we announced earlier today, we delivered 2013 adjusted
diluted earnings per share of $4.35 and introduced guidance for 2014 of $4.45 per share to $4.60 per share. With the
midpoint, reflecting 5% earnings growth over the midpoint of our 2013 guidance range. We also confirmed our
earnings per share growth objective of 4% to 6% through 2016, off a base of 2013. Dividend growth has been and will
remain central to our value proposition and our balance sheet remains strong.
Our total shareholder return for 2013 was 13%, exceeding the UTY return of 11%. Our primary focus in 2013 was on
positioning our regulated businesses for the future and I believe we accomplished this objective. Our goals were clear.
We had to complete our fleet modernization program, achieve constructive outcomes in five rate cases and resolve key
issues including the future of the Crystal River 3 Nuclear Station. Additionally, we had to focus on improving the
performance of our entire nuclear fleet and realizing our merger integration plans. Let me summarize each of these as
outlined on slide 5. During 2013, we completed our $9 billion fleet modernization program. This program added
approximately 6,600 megawatts of new combined cycle natural gas and state-of-the-art coal capacity in the Carolinas
and Indiana, replacing a similar amount of capacity for older plants we have or are retiring by 2015.
The Edwardsport IGCC Plant in Indiana went into commercial service in June and in November the Sutton Combined
Cycle Natural Gas Plant in North Carolina was put into service. At Edwardsport, we have completed GE's new product
introduction testing protocol and are working towards conducting required performance test.
Testing has been delayed in early 2014 by the extreme cold weather in the Midwest which has decreased plant output,
but we expect to continue tuning and systems optimization and preparation for final testing. All major technology
systems have been validated. We also remain on track to meet our total revised project cost estimate of $3.5 billion.
Next, we reached constructive regulatory outcomes in all five of our general rate cases to recover the investments made
to modernize our fleet and replace aging infrastructure in our transition and distribution system. When fully
implemented, these base rate cases will add about $600 million in additional annualized revenues while at the same
time keeping our customers retail rates for national averages.
In Florida, we made the decision to retire the Crystal River 3 Nuclear Plant, resolved insurance claims with our
insurance provider, NEIL and obtained approval from the Florida Commission of a comprehensive settlement. This
agreement addresses cost recovery not only related to the Crystal River 3 Nuclear Unit, but also to the Crystal River 1
and Crystal River 2 coal units and Levy nuclear project. Additionally, it contains provisions to invest in new generation
in the latter half of the decade, helping us to meet the future needs of our Florida customers.
Next, let me also highlight the performance of our nuclear fleet. In 2013, the combined capacity factor for our 11
nuclear units was 92.8%. This was the 15th consecutive year, for the nuclear fleet capacity factor above 90%. We're
making investments to improve performance at our nuclear plants. While important work remains, we are pleased with
the results to date, in particular at the Robinson Plant.
Let me move to another important area of accomplishment for 2013, fuel and joint dispatch savings, which are
benefiting our Carolina customers.
Through December 31, we exceeded our original targets and have reported approximately $190 million of cumulative
fuel and joint dispatch savings since the merger closed. We have contractually locked-in or generated about 65% of the
total guaranteed savings of $687 million over five years.

We're also realizing cost synergies by eliminating duplicative functions and have exceeded our original target of 5% to
7% in non-fuel O&M savings. We are in pace to deliver about 9% or $550 million of non-fuel O&M savings in 2014,
helping us to achieve flat O&M expenses from 2011 to 2014.
Overall, we've accomplished what we set out to do and have strengthened our regulated utility businesses in six
jurisdictions comprising 85% to 90% of Duke's annual earnings. Over the next several years, we'll focus on levering
our scale, driving out additional efficiencies and deploying capital for the benefit of our customers.
Next, let me provide a brief update on recent events at our Dan River Steam Station in North Carolina. You may recall
that we retired our coal units at this site in 2012 and replaced them with a new combined cycle gas station. In early
February, we detected a break in a stormwater pipe beneath the coal ash basin at the site, which resulted in ash basin
water and ash being discharged into the Dan River. We estimate between 30,000 tons and 39,000 tons of ash was
released into the river. We've permanently sealed the pipe and stopped the discharge.
Now that the pool of ash into the river has been contained, our immediate focus is on remediation and cleanup at the
site. We'll apply any lessons learned to our other coal ash basins. We continue to monitor and test the water quality of
the Dan River. Our tests to date show the drinking water supplies downstream from the site are safe. We are working
collaboratively with the EPA, the North Carolina Department of Energy and Natural Resources (sic) [North Carolina
Department of Environment and Natural Resources], U.S. Fish and Wildlife and other state and local authorities as we
respond to this matter.
We received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of North Carolina related to the Dan River coal
ash discharge. We will cooperate with this investigation. This accident should've never occurred. We take
responsibility and will learn from this event. We will continue to update you on this matter.
Last week, a significant winter storm struck our Carolinas service territories. We quickly deployed about 3,900
fieldworkers in the Carolinas, the Midwest and Florida to focus on restoration efforts. We've been able to restore more
than 900,000 outages and remain focused on restoring service to the few who remain without service. I appreciate the
efforts of the crews that work safely and diligently in a challenging environment.
Next, let me discuss yesterday's announcement that we are beginning a process to exit our Midwest generation
business. After an 18-month regulatory process, we were disappointed that the Ohio Commission denied our
application for our cost-based capacity charge late last week.
I want to thank the entire Ohio regulatory team that worked so diligently on this filing. However, this decision gives us
clarity. The volatility inherence in a merchant generation portfolio has challenged our ability to earn the level of
consistent and fair returns to our investors expect. This business is not a strategic fit for Duke Energy. We've
commenced a process to exit the business and have retained advisors to assist in the process. The redeployment of
proceeds from this process is expected to be accretive to our adjusted earnings per share. We will work closely with
employees, community leaders, and our joint owners during this process to ensure a smooth transition.
Additionally, we'll move quickly to finalize the required transfer of our coal-based generation assets out of the utility
and expect that to occur in the next 60 days. It's important for me to emphasize that we remain committed to our
electric and gas distribution utilities in Ohio and the 1.3 million customers we serve. These utilities are not a part of this
strategic process.
Before I turn the call over to Steve, let me summarize our strategic positioning with our remaining Commercial
Businesses.
We see opportunities to continue to grow our Renewables platform over the next two years and expect a greater mix of
solar in our capital deployment. We are targeting $400 million of Renewables capital annually and we have the
potential to deploy more if opportunities arrive. We also continue to develop commercial transmission options through
our DATC joint venture. We expect the project from this venture to mature over the next several years.
Our international business has also been an important contributor to earnings and cash flow. This past December, we've
returned $750 million of cash in a tax-advantaged structure. In 2014, we will undertake a strategic review of our

international business, as we periodically do with all of our businesses. The review will focus on positioning the
business for growth and optimizing cash flows. We will provide updates, as we finalize our review.
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve, to discuss our financial performance in 2013 as well as our financial plan for
growth in 2014 and beyond.
Steven K. Young
Thanks, Lynn. As Lynn highlighted, 2013 was a very good year for Duke. Let me start with our financial results for the
year as outlined on slide 8. As expected, our fourth quarter results were significantly higher than 2012, due to the
settlements in our 2013 rate cases, the adoption of nuclear levelization in the Carolinas, growth in our wholesale
business and the benefits of cost control. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1
compared to $0.70 for the prior year quarter. On a reported basis, our quarterly earnings were $0.97 compared to $0.62
for the prior year. I will focus most of my comments on our full year results. For more details on our quarterly earnings
drivers, see our press release materials from earlier this morning.
As Lynn reported, for the full year, we recognized 2013 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.35 compared to $4.32
for the prior year. On a reported basis, our full year earnings were $3.76 per share, compared to $3.07 per share in
2012. Here are highlights of our results compared to our original expectations.
For the year, our Regulated Utilities experienced favorable O&M expenses compared to 2012, supported by the impact
of increased merger synergies and the adoption of nuclear levelization. This helped to offset the impact of unfavorable
weather during the year. Our consolidated results benefited from a lower-than-expected effective tax rate of 33% for
the year, which is principally in our Other category. These improved results helped offset lower Commercial Power
contributions, which included results at Renewables, lower Midwest coal generation margins and the lack of a
favorable decision on our Ohio cost-based capacity filing.
Results at International Energy were consistent with our expectations. For the year, we experienced unfavorable foreign
exchange rates as well as lower results at National Methanol. Unfavorable rain conditions in Brazil impacted our results
early in the year. However, these conditions moderated in the back half of the year and our generation volumes were
favorable.
On slide 9, you can see our weather normalized customer volume trends for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2013,
as well as our future growth projections. For the fourth quarter of 2013, our weather normalized load growth was 0.9%
higher than the prior year quarter. This continued the favorable trend we began seeing in the third quarter as the
economy strengthened.
We continued to experience growth throughout our service territories. For the full year, our retail load growth was
0.6% higher, consistent with our expectations, 2013 was the fourth consecutive year we've experienced overall positive
retail load growth, principally driven by 0.9% industrial usage growth and 0.8% growth in the commercial sector, all
jurisdictions except for the reported strong retail and office building activity.
Residential demand was 0.3% higher for the year, benefiting from 0.8% growth in the average number of customers.
Usage on a per customer basis continues to trend flat to slightly negative. In Florida, we're encouraged by a modest
recovery in the housing market and in residential load.
As we look ahead to 2014, we're using 0.5% as our overall load growth planning assumption, roughly comparable with
2013. Although the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2013 were relatively stronger, we continue to remain
conservative as we have not yet obtained consistent sustained growth at these levels.
We expect to see growth in 2014 due to an approximate 1% increase in the number of residential customers, modest
growth in commercial, including data centers, and continuing growth in our industrial sector, specifically automotive
and housing related industries. Through 2016, we expect growth to trend between 0.5% and 1%, as the U.S. economy
and GDP strengthen. Over time, we expect the continued growth in our service territories will result in higher demand

for electricity.
On slide 10, you can see our 2014 earnings guidance range of between $4.45 per share and $4.60 per share. Primary
segment drivers I will discuss in a moment are based upon the $4.53 per share midpoint of this range.
Our largest segment, Regulated Utilities, is expected to generate approximately 90% of our 2014 consolidated results.
We expect this segment to deliver around $0.11 of additional earnings per share in 2014 over 2013. Significant drivers
include the full year impact of customer rates from our 2013 rate cases in the Carolinas and Ohio, normal weather,
customer load growth and increased wholesale contributions. These benefits are expected to be offset by higher
depreciation and lower AFUDC equity and reduced benefits from cost of removal amortization in Florida and nuclear
levelization in the Carolinas.
Let's briefly discuss each of these drivers. During 2013, we implemented revised customer rates in May for Duke
Energy Ohio, in June for Duke Energy Progress and in September for Duke Energy Carolinas. As a result in 2014, we
recognize a full year of the benefit of these revised customer rates, providing year-over-year earnings per share growth
of approximately $0.30 over 2013.
Our 2014 outlook assumes modest weather, normalized retail load growth of around 0.5%, which should generate
around $0.04 to $0.05 of additional earnings per share. 2013 was a mild year in terms of weather. Our assumptions for
2014 are based upon normal weather, which should add $0.08 of additional earnings per share. In fact, a recent blast of
cold temperatures we experienced in the Carolinas and Midwest during January resulted in favorable weather. While
we also expect storm restoration expenses from last week's winter storm in the Carolinas, it's too early in the year to
revise our full year projections as we still have 11 months ahead of us. As you know from past experience, weather
trends can change quickly.
Related to our wholesale business within our regulated footprint, we expect our long-term contracts to provide between
$0.07 and $0.08 of additional earnings per share growth in 2014, due to increasing annual load requirements embedded
in our contracts. Additionally, we will see reduced benefits from certain regulatory amortizations in 2014. Let me
briefly review them.
First, you may recall that the Florida Commission approved our ability to amortize a certain amount of our cost of
removal liabilities into earnings in a 2010 regulatory settlement. We amortized the final $110 million in cost of removal
liabilities in 2013, contributing around $0.10 per share, though there will be no benefit in 2014 from this non-cash
amortization.
Additionally, as part of our 2013 general rate cases, we've received approval to implement nuclear outage cost
levelization in the Carolinas. Once fully implemented in 2015, this levelization results in lower earnings volatility, due
to the timing of refueling outages. In 2013, nuclear levelization added $0.11 of earnings per share.
Due to the timing of planned refueling outages and the amortization of deferred costs, we expect a benefit of $0.05 per
share to $0.06 per share in 2014, less than the benefit recognized in 2013. Depreciation and other property related
expenses are expected to be higher and we'll accrue less AFUDC equity in 2014, resulting in lower earnings of
approximately $0.25 per share. This unfavorable impact is principally due to placing our recently completed new
generating projects such as the Sutton Combined Cycle Gas Plant into service. Further, our costs will increase as the
result of the recognition of previously deferred costs, resulting from our recent rate cases.
Finally, excluding the impact of nuclear levelization, we're assuming fairly flat O&M costs from 2013 to 2014.
Additional merger synergies and lower benefit costs during 2014 will help to offset the impact of inflation and other
emerging costs, such as higher possible outage costs.
Next, we expect Commercial Power to generate around $0.16 of additional earnings per share in 2014. For 2014, PJM
capacity revenues for the Midwest generation fleet will increase by an average of approximately $60 per megawatt day.
This will result in higher earnings contributions from Commercial Power of around $0.12. Our 2014 earnings guidance
assumes a full year contributions from the Midwest generation fleet, which we have started a process to exit.

We believe it is unlikely we will close on the sale transaction in 2014. As the estimated fair value of this fleet is below
current book value, we expect to recognize a pre-tax impairment charge of between $1 billion to $2 billion in the first
quarter of 2014. This loss will be treated as a special item, excluded from our adjusted earnings per share results.
Additionally, it is possible the business maybe reclassified for accounting purposes to discontinued operations at some
point in 2014. Even if it is classified as discontinued operations, we expect to continue reflecting any Midwest
generation fleet earnings in our adjusted earnings per share results. Earnings contributions from our commercial
Renewables fleet are also expected to increase in 2014.
We currently operate a portfolio of 1,740 megawatts of mostly wind generation with a small but growing amount of
solar. Our results in 2014 will be supported by the 33 megawatts of solar projects, we put into service in 2013, as well
as the 200 megawatts of wind projects, which are expected to be in service later this year.
Next, International Energy. In 2014, we expect segment net income to increase by approximately $0.03 per share, up
5% from 2013's results. During the year, higher pricing and volumes in Brazil will help mitigate unfavorable foreign
exchange rates. In January, reservoir levels in Southeast Brazil were lower-than-expected, at the close of the month, the
level slightly above where they were at this point last year.
Weaknesses continued in the early portion of February. The rainy season in Brazil continues through April. We will
continue to monitor conditions and keep you updated as the year progresses. Due to a change in regulatory stipulations,
short-term energy prices in Brazil now include the full cost of thermal dispatch. In order to minimize our financial risk
due to extended drought conditions, we are currently contracting at slightly lower percentages than in previous years.
As a result, we are less exposed to core hydrological conditions and position to benefit from any excess hydro
generation. For Other, we expect an increase in the effective tax rate. On a consolidated basis, our effective tax rate is
expected to be between 33% and 34%.
We expect non-fuel O&M to remain flat during the three year period from 2011 to 2014. Our cost control efforts will
be an important factor in achieving our 2014 earnings per share guidance range. Let me provide a brief overview on
where we are.
Turning to slide 11, significant amount of our savings to date has been related to corporate center costs. And we expect
further corporate center costs reductions in 2015 and 2016 as employees are able to work on a single integrated
financial and HR platform. By the end of the first quarter, the remaining employees under our voluntary severance plan
will leave the company as we drive further efficiencies.
We are also achieving significant supply chain benefits as we continue to renegotiate procurement contracts. We
continue to benefit from our scale as a larger purchaser of materials, supplies, inventory equipment and services. We've
completed around 60% of our merger initiatives and expect the remainder to be essentially complete by the end of this
year.
Next, let me discuss the shaping of our quarterly results in 2014 as highlighted on slide 12. In 2013, our earnings were
more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year, due to the significant impact of our regulatory activity. As we
move into 2014, we expect a more normal distribution of our quarter-by-quarter earnings compared to last year. As a
result, you will find during the year the comparisons of our quarterly results from 2013 to 2014 will once again be
challenging. We expect higher year-over-year results in the first three quarters of 2014 and lower comparable results in
the fourth quarter. These expectations assume normal weather. As in past years, we expect the third quarter to be the
most significant contributor to our annual results due to summer load demand.
Our 2014 cash flow and financing assumptions are summarized on slide 13. You can see that our sources of cash flow
in 2014 are estimated at approximately $7.7 billion, compared to total sources of around $7.3 billion in 2013. This
increase is largely driven by the full year benefit of revised customer rates in 2013, as we convert our modernization
investments into cash earnings. We expect capital investments of approximately $6.1 billion, mostly in Regulated
Utilities. Dividend distributions to our shareholders are expected to be around $2.2 billion, while discretionary
contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $145 million.

Due to the significant growth investments we are making, we expect our uses of cash will exceed our sources of cash
by around $800 million during the year. In order to fund this deficit, as well as our debt maturities of approximately $2
billion, we expect to issue around $3 billion of total debt, including commercial paper. Our financing plan for 2014 is
outlined in charts on the right side of the slide. As you can see, most of our financings are driven by maturities of
long-term debt.
Our current credit ratings and projected metrics for 2014 are outlined on slide 14. We're pleased with Moody's action a
few weeks ago to upgrade the ratings of our holding company and four of our utilities. As a result of the strength of our
metrics, our plans do not require any incremental equity issuances, during our three year planning horizon from 2014 to
2016. As of the end of 2013, we have total available liquidity of $5.6 billion, excluding cash held offshore of
approximately $1.1 billion.
Slide 15 provides an overview of the primary drivers of our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth objectives through
2016. Let me explain, how we get there. Our Regulated Utilities are expected to contribute an average of 4% growth,
underpinned by rate base growth, customer load growth of between 0.5% and 1% and growth in our wholesale
business. Wholesale is expected to contribute an additional $0.07 to $0.08 of earnings per share in 2014 and 2015,
while moderating to around an additional $0.01 per share to $0.02 per share in 2016. This adds around 2% of earnings
per share growth through 2016. This growth is expected to be partially offset by the impacts of regulatory lag and
additional depreciation since we do not have significant rate case activity plan through 2016. We're targeting flat O&M
costs from 2014 to 2016, as the success of our merger integration savings helps offset inflationary pressures and other
emerging costs, more details on that in a minute.
Next, we expect our non-regulated businesses to be modestly higher through 2016. Commercial Power is expected to
add around 1% of average earnings per share growth, as we continue to expand the renewable portfolio. International
Energy is expected to be relatively flat through 2016. Reduction in contributions from National Methanol as well as
unfavorable Brazilian foreign currency exchange rates is expected to be substantially offset by an average annual
increase in Brazil pricing of approximately 6% through 2016.
You may recall that our ownership percentage in National Methanol decreases from 25% to 17.5%, upon completion of
the new production facility, which is estimated to occur in mid-2016. The incremental earnings from this new facility
are not expected to fully offset the reduction in our ownership percentage. As a result, the annualized impact of this
change is estimated to reduce our equity earnings from National Methanol by around 25% to 30%.
As you know, earnings from National Methanol are correlated to Brent crude oil prices. Our forecast assumes low
year-over-year volatility in Brent crude oil prices through 2016. Our Other category is expected to incur higher interest
expenses we continue to finance at the holding company level and our effective tax rate is expected to trend higher.
We have also included up to 1% of additional growth from capital redeployment in the incremental investment
opportunities. Redeployment of proceeds from our Midwest generation process is expected to be accretive. We'd also
continue to develop additional growth opportunities, such as the NCEMPA transaction, which I will discuss in a
moment, taken as a whole our plant results and solid earnings per share growth, within our long-term 4% to 6% growth
objectives.
Now, let me move to our efforts to maintain productivity and efficiency in our cost structure. We've made tremendous
progress in achieving cost savings from the merger; our rigorous process has given us confidence that we can continue
to drive operational efficiencies throughout the organization, in generation of power delivery to additional savings in
the corporate center. We're applying lessons learned from our merger integration initiatives and driving further
efficiencies from our recent system consolidation efforts.
We've initiated efforts to consolidate our enterprise asset management and award management systems into a single
platform of process, underpinning efficiencies in many of our functional departments. As a result, we're targeting flat
O&M through 2016. Our overall growth is supported by investments in our businesses. In 2013, we spent
approximately $5.6 billion of which approximately 90% was in our Regulated Utilities. As outlined on slide 17, from
2014 to 2016, we're forecasting total CapEx investments of between $20 billion and $22 billion, consistent with our

business mix, about 85% or approximately $17 billion of this CapEx is expected to be deployed in our Regulated
Utilities, an annual average of around $6 billion.
Let me provide a further breakdown of our Regulated Utilities capital investments over the three year period from 2014
to 2016. Over the three year period, we expect to spend $3.4 billion on new generation growth projects principally in
the Carolinas and Florida. These investments also include nuclear performance improvements in compliance with NRC
regulations.
First, let's discuss the Carolinas. We have a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity request pending with the
South Carolina Commission related to the 750-megawatt Lee Combined Cycle Natural Gas Plant. Hearings have been
held and we expect the Commission decision by the end of the second quarter. If approved, the plant could be in
service as early as mid-2017. This project will accrue non-cash AFUDC earnings during the construction period.
We also continue to make investments to improve the performance of our nuclear fleet in the Carolinas and to comply
with the NRC's Fukushima requirements. Further, we are evaluating regulated solar investment opportunities to meet
our renewable portfolio standard requirements in North Carolina, as well as a growing desire for renewable generation
sources. We recently issued an RFP for up to 300 megawatts of solar in North Carolina targeted to be in service by the
end of 2015. We'll evaluate both purchase power and ownership options as part of the RFP process.
Moving next to Florida. Our recent settlement agreement gives us the ability to invest in additional peaking and
baseload generating capacity. Once in service, we'll able to recover prudently incurred investments related to this
generation without the need to file a general base rate case. We continue to evaluate options related to the need for up
to an additional 1,150 megawatts of capacity by 2017. This could consist of a mixture of self build acquisition upgrades
or PPAs. The amount of additional capacity is likely to be reduced, if we were able to obtain an approval to burn
non-traditional coal at the Crystal River 1 and Crystal River 2 units through 2018. We expect to make filings with the
Florida Commission by mid-2014, outlining the most cost effective options for our customers. We also issued an RFP
to add approximately 1,640 megawatts of combined cycle gas-fired baseload generation in Florida in 2018.
We are evaluating proposals submitted from other potential power providers and also submitted our own self-build
option. We expect to finalize and announce the most cost effective options for our Florida customers by late summer of
this year. We are also assessing transmission and distribution investments to increase the reliability of our systems.
In Indiana, we are continuing to develop a plan under Senate Bill 560 that could potentially be filed with the Indiana
Commission later this year. Items under consideration include investments to improve our reliability to our customers,
as well as to improve the type and timing of information we can provide to them. While our analysis is still ongoing,
we expect potential investments of between $1 billion to $2 billion over seven years.
We will provide further updates on the scope of our plan when it has been finalized. Senate Bill 560 allows for
recovery of qualified transmission and distribution projects through a rider mechanism. Our plan also includes T&D
investments in Ohio, which are subject to rider recovery, as well as further consolidation and investments to upgrade
certain control centers, throughout all of our service territories.
Next, let me review our environmental compliance expenditures. Over the past decade, our legacy companies spent
approximately $7 billion, investing in scrubbers and SCRs. Based on our current assumptions and the timing of final
regulations and how the EPA will adopt rules around air, water, and residual waste, we currently estimate we will
spend between $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion over the next 10 years, with $900 million expected to be spent in the 2014
to 2016 timeframe. Approximately 85% of our expected environmental compliance investments will be in the Carolinas
and Indiana. Both of these jurisdictions have a strong track record of allowing utilities to recover costs related to
environmental compliance investments. We have environmental tracking mechanisms in Indiana and Florida.
From 2014 to 2016, we'll spend $1.6 billion on nuclear fuel, the cost of this [ph] recovered and utilized through our fuel
clauses (36:01). Another $1.4 billion is expected to be spent to expand our distribution system, as we connect
additional customers and increase our revenue base. Finally, we will invest in maintaining the reliability and
performance of our system. From 2014 to 2016, we expect to spend approximately $9 billion on maintenance of our
system, principally offsetting our annual depreciation.

In our non-regulated businesses, we expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion over the three year period from 2014 to
2016, an average of around $500 million. This consists of growth capital of $1.2 billion for our Renewables business,
as well as an additional $300 million in maintenance capital for our Midwest generation and international businesses.
Our range includes a level of discretionary capital up to $2 billion from 2014 to 2016, giving us flexibility to pursue
opportunities for incremental growth projects in both our regulated and non-regulated businesses. In a moment, I will
discuss some potential opportunities we're evaluating. In 2016, we will begin construction of new generation plants to
be in service in 2017 and 2018, principally in the Carolinas and Florida. This will cause the range of our CapEx
investments to accelerate in 2016 and beyond.
Next I'll provide details on the incremental investment projects I mentioned previously. First, as we announced earlier
this month, we've been in exclusive discussions with the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency regarding
the potential to purchase their minority ownership interest in certain existing Duke Energy Progress plants, a total of
700 megawatts of coal and nuclear generation.
If an agreement is reached, there are several approvals we would need to obtain for this transaction. Potential next steps
would include a filing with the FERC, a request for the NRC to approve the transfer of the nuclear licenses, DOJ
Antitrust approval, as well as approvals from the Carolinas commissions. It is too early to speculate on the timing
needed to complete the transaction as negotiations are still ongoing. If we're able to reach an agreement, we would
enter into a long-term wholesale power contract with NCEMPA; we will keep you updated.
An additional growth opportunity is the potential for gas infrastructure investments across our regulated jurisdictions.
We were reminded of the importance of robust gas infrastructure during the recent extreme cold January weather. We
intend to explore the viability of additional pipeline capacity into various jurisdictions to expand the infrastructure
necessary to continue to support an expanding gas-fired generation fleet. We also have the potential to invest in
additional non-regulated renewable projects above our annual capital budget of approximately $400 million.
Additionally, we continue to evaluate growth investment opportunities in projects at International that meet our risk
adjusted return expectations.
Next, let me discuss the dividend payments to our shareholders, a cornerstone of our investment value proposition. As
you can see on slide 19, we've consistently increased the dividend an average of 2% annually over the last several
years. The board ultimately has final say about the dividend. We believe the board has the flexibility to increase the
growth in the dividend to be more consistent with our earnings per share growth once we have achieved our targeted
payout ratio of 65% to 70%. Based on the midpoint of our 2014 guidance range, we expect our payout ratio this year to
be at the top end of the range at around 70%.
I will close on slide 20 with a discussion of our financial objectives. We have a strong track record of meeting these
objectives. In addition to being well-positioned to achieve our 2014 EPS guidance range, we have a solid plan to
deliver longer-term EPS growth of 4% to 6% through 2016. While growing earnings, we will continue to support the
dividend payments to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our financial performance for the year and how we're positioned for the future. We
will maintain our strong growth platform through investment opportunities in both our Regulated Utilities and our
Commercial Businesses. We will continue to focus on providing our customers with low cost and reliable service while
we drive efficiencies across the entire business.
Now, I will turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn J. Good
Thank you, Steve. Let me briefly close with our priorities for 2014 and beyond as outlined on slide 21. Simply stated,
we will focus on achieving our financial objectives, including our earnings per share guidance range for 2014 as well as
growing the dividend and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We will also focus on driving further productivity in our
businesses and deploying capital for the benefit of our customers and shareholders.

As I mentioned, we will also turn our attention to enhance value from our Commercial Businesses including advancing
our process to exit the Midwest generation business. We will maintain our focus on strong outreach to our important
state and federal stakeholders as overall industry terms and regulations continue to evolve.
Duke Energy is a low risk, long-term holding with an excellent track record of performance. I'm honored to lead this
company and work with an extremely talented team. I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished in 2013 and our
platform gives us many opportunities to grow the company and create value for our customers, investors and
communities.

Q&A

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Citigroup.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Shar.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Well, we've sort of reiterated your EPS growth trajectory of 4% to 6% off for 2013. But looking
at slide 17, it looks like your CapEx profile looks flat beyond 2016. Is that sort of a placeholder and how should we
think about the EPS growth trajectory if you were to exit the Ohio business given the fact it could be accretive?
<A - Steven K. Young>: I think our CapEx profile does grow beyond 2016. I think back in our appendices, we showed
that our rate base growth moves in the range of 6% beyond 2016. As we ramp up the Lee Combined Cycle Plants, the
potential for the Florida Combined Cycle and also we will see a change in 2016 and beyond as we become a significant
taxpayer and a decrease in deferred taxes has now put an upward push on our rate base as well, Shar. So I think we do
have growth in the earnings space.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Got you. Very helpful. And then just when you think about potential uses of cash, as you exit
Ohio generation, is there any areas that we should be not thinking about as far as the source of cash or I think when
you're maybe potentially quoted in media as source of cash could be buybacks. Is there anything we should focus on or
what we could roll out?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yes, Shar. We haven't made a decision on use of proceeds. We'd like this process to mature over
the course of 2014 and we will look at incremental investment opportunities that may be ripe, and what I would also
say is we would not rule out a share buyback. But those decisions will be made down the road as we complete the
process.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.

And we'll take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey. Just, glad you guys finally came to a determination on commercial operations. Can you
just clarify when that earnings contribution's included in guidance for both the 2014 number and the growth rate? And
then if it comes out what are you using for substitution to help sustain the growth rate beyond 2014.

<A - Lynn J. Good>: Dan, the earnings contributions of the Midwest generation is in 2014. And then as we think
about the build up for growth over the 2014 to 2016 period, we believe that redeployment of the proceeds will be
accretive and be a strong contributor to the 4% to 6% growth rate.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Do you have a placeholder, maybe on 2014 for – using some assumption of cash for debt
paydown or some other reinvestment to support the growth rate, is that the right way to think about it?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: That's correct.
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's correct.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And then on international, if I look at kind of the contribution of growth rate drivers, as you
show by business line out through 2016, international looks like you kind of added a zero contribution to the growth
rates, so it's just kind of treading water over those years. How does that slow down that flat looking outlook effect of
the strategic review you guys are going through right now?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Dan, I'd say it's been a catalyst for the review, we looked at a strategic review of international
probably five years ago or six years ago. We think it's appropriate to do so again. We do this periodically for all of our
businesses. We are pleased with the international business, the contributions they've made over time, but we'd like to
explore positioning for better growth and for optimization of cash flow, and so that will be our focus in 2014.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Is the impairment you guys took on commercial or the one you will take given that extra cash
surplus, does that make it easier to think about monetize international, because you have a better offset to maybe any
repatriation cash you'd have to deal with?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Dan, I wouldn't jump to monetization of international, what I would suggest is let us work
through the process and evaluate a range of options, and as we complete our review, we will be in a position to talk
further about it.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.

I'm afraid on the Midwest and you said the use of proceeds will be accretive, but is that a statement net of losing the
earnings of business...
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yes.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: ...and the – okay. So it's on an aggregate state, it's not just that you'll have an accretive
offset.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: That's right.
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's correct.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you. Sorry to go back to that. And then on international, you talked about a

line-of-sight on? Currently, how much of that is already priced and how much of that is an assumption?
<A - Steven K. Young>: We have pretty good line-of-sight to that, Jonathan. Our revenue pricing in our contracts in
Brazil is tagged to inflation indices that have been pretty consistent and they are on lagging indices. So we've already
seen some of those metrics come through and the forecast for inflation in Brazil and so forth are pretty stable. And so
we feel pretty good about those pricing metrics.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So that's not – you don't have kind of re-contracting embedded in that assumption. That's
just the current contracts in place?

And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS Investments.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So quick question following up on the international strategic review, could you
elaborate perhaps on what those options are more specifically.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Julien, I think it's premature to talk about the range of options. What I would say is just
emphasizing – we'll be looking at ways to position the business to grow and also ways to further optimize cash flow.
The fact that we were able to identify an opportunity to bring $750 million home, I think it's a good indication of work
that we put underway in 2013 and we'll just continue that strategic focus in 2014 as we have more information well of
course share it.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And just to be clear, anything you would do would need to be accretive?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I think that's a good starting point.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: All right. Just to be clear. And then perhaps looking at the earned ROE assumption in
the build up if you will of the 4% to 6%, you have a regulatory lag/depreciation of minus 3%. What kind of earned
ROE degradation or what are you assuming as you think about the near year period, the three year?
<A - Steven K. Young>: We project that we're going to be earning very close to our allowed returns in all of our
jurisdictions. You do have regulatory lag, but you've also got new investments that are going into riders and accruing
AFUDC and earnings and so forth. Additionally, one of the big key elements that gets us to a rate freeze period is being
able to eliminate rate lag due to O&M increases. Keeping O&M flat is very significant here and should help us to earn
our allowed returns.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And then lastly, quick question on the 2014 assumption on guidance, there is a big
Other jump from minus $128 million to minus $215 million. Could you talk about that quickly?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Yes. In the Other area of it, we're looking at two things that occur there. You've got Holdco
interest expense, which goes up as you issue Holdco debt to fund some of the growth in the business. And then we do
expect our effective tax rate to jump and increase by roughly 1% and the effective tax rate goes up for a couple of
reasons. One is that, as you move forward, the Progress entity has less permanent differences, less tax benefits, so,
when it's mixed into the Duke entity as a whole, which has Renewables and International, it pushes the effective tax

rate up a bit. Also, we are seeing that, we have less AFUDC equity impacts in the tax rate. So, that drives the effective
tax rate up a bit as well.

And we'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Brian.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Hello, Brian.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi, good morning. Hi, good morning, Lynn. Good morning, Steve. For your comments on slide
18, on transmission and gas infrastructure, could you talk a little bit more about, what opportunities might manifest
themselves as you complete your evaluations?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Brian, this is an early stage evaluation of infrastructure in the Southeast, as we continue to look
at adding gas-fired generation in the Carolinas, in particular we have some dependency here on a pipeline
infrastructure, that we'd like to explore other options. And so, this is something that is on our radar screen for strategic
growth and objective that we'd like to achieve. We also think it's important for reliability for customers. And so, we'll
be exploring that over the next year or two years to see if an investment makes sense.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Should we be thinking about that in the terms of gas or pipeline investments potentially that
connect to your gas-fired generation? Is that sort of the primary thrust of where that thought process is going?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yes.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Great. And then, just one other question on this slide, for commercial solar, and your wind assets
in general, just how do you think about the opportunity to construct the yield curve like some of your peers?
<A - Steven K. Young>: We've looked at yield curves, Brian, and we will continue to keep an eye on those types of
financing vehicles. But a couple of things to keep in mind on a yield curve that we're looking at, one is that, we trade as
a yield curve already. And so, isolating assets there may not have as much incremental benefit for our shareholders.
Another thing you've to keep an eye on with yield curves is they require very disciplined investment profile. You
typically have to match up the investments with tax benefits that roll-off under accelerated depreciation, and it requires
quite a disciplined investment and capital and that flexibility in our capital planning may be a hurdle in setting up a
yield curve.

And we'll take our next question from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Hi. My question is – hi, how are you? My question goes to the ash pond cleanup
issue, you've been under some – you've been fighting some legal suits in the Carolinas regarding supposed groundwater
contamination, if I remember correctly and now we have the Dan River break at the end of this year, I think, EPA will
come out with its coal ash regulations. What is the long-term thinking regarding how you're going to handle that, are
those costs included in your environmental CapEx and what would be the prospects for recovery?

<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hugh, let me break that question down. I'll speak first of all about Dan River. We have been very
focused over the last two weeks with a 24x7 operation to put a permanent solution in place and to begin remediation.
We will take the learnings from this experience and look for ways that we can improve overall management of our ash
ponds. And we are very focused on ensuring the integrity of our basins throughout our system and so that's efforts that
we'll continue.
If I transition to the broader level about ash pond remediation, the implications of the coal combustion residuals rule,
we do expect those rules by the end of this year. And when Steve talked about the $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, that does
include ash pond closures; it also includes conversion to dry handling. And so those estimates will continue to be
updated and evolve as those regulations are finalized.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Good. Okay. And is recovery ordinarily available to you in the states where the
plants are located?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yes. Yes...
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Okay.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: ...we've had a good history of environmental recovery. I think 85% of our environmental costs
are in Indiana and the Carolinas. And we have demonstrated recovery of environmental costs in both of those
jurisdictions.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Great. Just a quick follow-up on an earlier question regarding the Other segment.
The significant decline in expense in that segment relative to your expectations, I think you were expecting something
like, was it $208 million and you ended up incurring only – you were expecting $205 million and you ended up
incurring only $128 million. Was that also attributable to a favorable change in the effective tax rate or were there other
factors at play?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Income taxes were a large portion of that. We found some state optimization tax benefit
opportunities that we took advantage of, but also there were some lower costs in our captive insurance area as well.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Meaning that the losses from your insurance policies are not as high as you had
anticipated?
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's correct.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Yes. Okay. Thank you very much.

at a stage where dividend growth is within the same range or close to earnings growth? And is there ever a stage
coming for Duke, where dividend growth is faster than earnings growth?

<A - Lynn J. Good>: I'll take the first part of that question, Michael. So we're trending to 70% in 2014 and so we will
look very closely at increasing the level of the dividends, working with the board of course as it is ultimately their
decision, but our aspiration is to grow the dividend over time consistent with earnings growth. I think the latter part of
your question is probably something that's a few years out as we look at the way the macro trends in the business
continue to evolve. So I think our objective is to always put together a combination of earnings growth and dividend
that's attractive to our shareholders and that objective won't change.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And then an environmental question, I mean, there's obviously lots of talk about
potential carbon rules coming out this summer or a little later. Well, could you talk a little bit about what's in your
expectations in terms of what the rules for both coal ash and 316(b) could look like?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We have some specifics and Keith Trent is here, Michael, let me direct the question to Keith to
give you a little bit of visibility in what's in our plan for the next three years and then he can talk beyond that.
<A - B. Keith Trent>: Sure. Michael, with respect to coal ash, we do expect that it would be designated as
non-hazardous. So that's the general assumption that we're working with. And in terms of specific investment, we have
a very detailed plan. What I would tell you is the four largest categories of spend, one is on the SCRs at Cayuga and
then we have precipitator refurbishment at six plants. We have dry ash conversion at multiple plants and then also ash
pond closure. So, those are the four biggest conversions – our biggest spends that we have in this category. But again,
in terms of CCR, we're expecting non-hazardous.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Last item, just a cash flow related question. What do you see – I noticed the
guidance for Commercial Power in the Commercial Businesses, it seems like it's being driven largely by tax benefit.
Am I interpreting that correctly, that – I think it's one of the slides in the appendix where you assume a 40% to 50%,
50% to 60% tax benefit at that business?
<A - Steven K. Young>: At the Renewables business, a great deal of the economics are driven by tax benefits. That's
correct, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: So is the assumption then that the actual EBITDA of that business, combined with
Commercial Power is kind of pretty low but the renewable business, the tax benefits drive kind of the uptick in
earnings power from the business?
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's correct, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you, Michael.

We'll take our next question from Kit Konolige with BGC.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Kit.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: So to get back for a second to the Midwest generation. Can you elaborate a little bit on the
discussion of your expectations for taking the charge on that business? If I wrote it down correctly, you said that you
expected a charge of $1 billion to $2 billion in 2014, which as I understood it would be the difference between your
projected fair market value versus the book value?
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's correct, that's correct, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: And, Steve, what's the book value currently on that?

<A - Steven K. Young>: The net book value of the property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation is
in the ballpark of $3.5 billion.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Okay.
<A - Steven K. Young>: There will be other items that could come into play in this calculation, inventories, deferred
taxes, some of those kind of things. I don't want to be over precise, but $3.5 billion is the property, plant and
equipment.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: And you said you don't expect any transaction to close in 2014?
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's correct.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: So can we understand from that, that the sale process might take something like, about six months
or something like that?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hey, Kit. This is Lynn. I think given the fact our announcement of yesterday and we're getting
advisors in play. So I think we'll be in a position to give you more clarity on timing as we move into the first quarter
call. But based on our present expectations, we think a 12-month period is probably a reasonable planning assumption.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: A 12-month period, Lynn, from now until closing or now until an announcement of the sale?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Now until closing.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Okay. Great. Okay, great. That's my questions. Thank you.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Thank you, Kit.
