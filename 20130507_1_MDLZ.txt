Thanks, Dexter, and good afternoon. Our first quarter performance was in line with the expectations that we
communicated earlier this year. Revenue growth remains below our long-term target and we're certainly not satisfied
with that. But behind the aggregate numbers, our underlying business momentum continued to improve as we drove a
virtuous growth cycle in each region.
Emerging markets accelerated sequentially while results in developed markets continued to be solid. Revenue growth
was high quality, driven by volume mix, strong Power Brands and market share gains. Our biscuits, chocolate and
candy categories continued to grow strongly. Adjusted gross profit increased which provided the fuel to step up our
investments in emerging markets. While we're well-positioned in many of these countries today, the race is clearly on
to fortify and expand our presence.
As a focused snacking company, we believe that now is the time to step up our investments in brand building, in sales
and route-to-market and in capacity to ensure we've planted the necessary seeds that will bear fruit for many years to
come. You'll begin to see the payoff of these investments more clearly as revenue growth accelerates in the second half.
With this solid underlying momentum, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our full year commitments as well
as sustainable profitable growth over the long-term.
Let's look now at the details for the quarter. Organic net revenue grew 3.8%. As we've said, the impact of lower coffee
prices and capacity constraints again tempered top-line growth. These two factors will continue to affect our second
quarter until we lap the price declines and new capacity comes on stream. We're encouraged, however, by the
underlying quality of our revenue. Our focus on Power Brands continues to pay off. In fact, they grew 7.5%, nearly
equal our overall rate. Our volume/mix trends are also strong, accounting for two-thirds of our growth. These vol/mix
and Power Brands gains in turn translated into solid market shares.
Looking at our results geographically, we see the same underlying trend. In developed markets, Europe delivered solid
vol/mix growth, and U.S. biscuits continued to benefit from a focused direct store delivery sales force. In emerging
markets, revenue was up over 9%. That's about a point higher than last quarter despite the impact of capacity
constraints.
Our performance in the BRIC countries was also solid. Brazil grew strongly, up mid-teens. China, up more than 20%.
India grew low double digits despite capacity constraints in chocolate. Russia was up modestly, but its growth
represented a significant turnaround from the declines posted in the back half of 2012. We continue to focus on
increasing gross profit to generate the fuel to sustain our growth.
In the first quarter, adjusted gross profit grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by vol/mix gains. This
helped fund advertising and consumer support at 9.6% of revenue, up 20 basis points from our full year 2012 rate.
Higher adjusted gross profit also enabled us to invest in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion in our
emerging markets. These increased investments along with some one-time items dampened operating income growth
and margins. We remain committed to expanding overall operating income margin by an average of 20 basis points to
30 basis points annually, but in the near-term, we will continue to use cost savings particularly from Europe and North
America to strengthen our emerging markets position.
Let's now take a look at each of our categories. Globally, biscuits were up 8% including 13% growth of our Power
Brands. Oreo was a key driver, up mid-teens. The world's favorite cookie posted strong growth in each region and was
the top-selling biscuit brand in China during the critical New Year season. A number of other biscuit brands also
performed well. Barni grew mid-teens, Chips Ahoy! was up high teens as we continue to broaden distribution in
emerging markets. And our Tuc and Club Social savory brands increased nearly 30% behind new marketing
campaigns.
Geographically, biscuits grew low double digits in emerging markets with strong growth in Latin America and
Asia-Pacific. And in developed markets, both North America and Europe drove mid-single digit gains. Biscuits also
delivered outstanding share performance with nearly 90% of our revenue in key markets gaining or holding share.

Turning to chocolate, global revenue increased 5%. Power Brands grew nearly twice as fast led by Milka, Cadbury
Dairy Milk and Lacta. In emerging markets, chocolate revenue was up double digits. In Brazil, a solid Easter season
and strong growth of Lacta drove the gains. And in India, chocolate grew low double digits despite the impact of the
capacity constraints I mentioned earlier. Smaller markets such as Egypt, Argentina and Poland also delivered good
growth. In developed markets, chocolate revenue was up low single digit with a strong showing in Europe. Overall,
more than half of our chocolate revenue in key markets gained or held share.
Gum and candy revenue, however, remains disappointing, declining 1%. The decrease was driven entirely by gum's
poor performance in developed markets. Here, revenue was down high-teens as category trends continued to soften.
We also lost some share. As we've stated before, we are not counting on a significant turnaround in gum this year and
our guidance reflects that. But let me assure you we are not sitting idly by and accepting these trends. We're actively
testing a number of ideas to rejuvenate the category and we've begun to roll out several initiatives to stem our share
declines.
First, we're changing price/size architecture on both ends of the spectrum, more small packs at lower price points and
more value offerings in larger pack sizes. Second, hard-hitting advertising that focuses on functional benefits such as
oral care. Third, driving better placement of high-impact displays; and fourth, getting the right product assortment on
shelf. Early results of these initiatives have been encouraging but due to the sheer breadth of retail outlets to be
addressed as well as the timing of shelf reset, rolling out these initiatives broadly has taken much longer than we would
have liked.
In contrast, gum in emerging markets grew nicely, up mid-single digits with solid share gains. The launch of Stride in
China last August and strong results in Brazil led the way. Also helping to offset the gum challenges, candy again
delivered strong results, up mid-single digits with growth in both emerging and developed markets. Halls was a
standout, up low-teens behind innovation and the benefit of a rough cold and flu season.
Finally, in our beverages and cheese and grocery categories, revenue was flat while Power Brands grew 2%. Coffee
revenues declined mid-single digits as we passed through significantly lower green coffee costs especially in our roast
and ground business. On-demand and soluble coffee on the other hand, which together account for more than half of
our global coffee revenues performed well. Finally, powdered beverages continue to deliver strong performance with
revenue up mid-teens. So in sum, our overall results were in line with expectations with encouraging evidence of strong
underlying momentum.
Let me now turn it over to Dave to provide additional information about our first quarter performance as well as our
updated outlook.
David A. Brearton
Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Before reviewing our quarter one results in more detail, let me first highlight the
changes to our reporting structure for 2013. Previously, we reported our operations in three segments: North America,
Europe, and Developing Markets. With the spin-off of our North American grocery operations, we've changed our
reporting segments this year to give investors more clarity into our operations. We now report in five segments: North
America, Europe, Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EEMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. We issued an
8-K last month that provided a historical breakdown of revenue and operating income based on these new reporting
segments.
The 8-K included annual results for 2010 to 2012 and quarterly results for the past two years. In another effort to
provide insight into the business, we've delineated our portfolio into two parts: emerging markets and developed
markets. We define emerging markets to include all of the Latin America and EEMEA segments. Our Asia-Pacific
segment excluding Australia, New Zealand, and Japan is included as well. We also add the central European countries
that are now part of the Europe segment. Using this definition, 39% of our revenues were generated in emerging
markets last year. Developed markets include all of North America, our Europe segment excluding the countries of

central Europe and Australia, New Zealand and Japan. When discussing our performance in emerging and developed
markets, we'll limit the commentary to revenue. We'll continue to report profitability only for our five regional
segments.
With that, let's now take a closer look at our top-line results. As Irene mentioned, we delivered 3.8% organic revenue
growth. Vol/mix drove 2.5 percentage points or about two-thirds of the increase while pricing contributed 1.3 points.
This included the impact of lower coffee prices as well as capacity constraints in a number of markets. Overall, coffee
revenues negatively affected our growth rate by 1.3 points. That's higher than what we expected largely due to the
timing of sales of roast and ground coffee in Europe. In addition, capacity constraints provided a headwind of about
half a point. This impact is lower than expected as we successfully stretched capacity and used co-manufacturers to
increase production. Emerging markets grew 9.3% in the first quarter, on route to our double-digit target. That
compares favorably to the 8.4% rate we delivered in both Q4 and for the full year 2012 as growth in both Brazil and
Russia improved considerably. Developed markets grew 0.4%, was primarily due to the impact of coffee pricing.
Let's now take a closer look at top-line performance in each of the regions. In Latin America, organic revenue was up a
strong 12.6%. To offset inflation, we took aggressive pricing actions in several markets. As a result, pricing contributed
9.4 percentage points with 3.2 points due to vol/mix gains. Brazil was the region's star performer. In the first quarter,
revenue was up mid-teens, well above the mid-single digit increase posted in the fourth quarter. This growth was
high-quality driven by vol/mix. It was also broad-based with strong performance in each of Brazil's key categories. The
North-Northeast region also performed well, up 25% as we continue to expand distribution. Brazil posted notable
market share gains in chocolate, gum and powdered beverages.
Performance in other key Latin American markets also was solid. In Venezuela, growth was quite strong despite the
country's economic challenges. And in Argentina, growth remains solid but slowed in the face of price controls that
limited our flexibility. The region's Power Brands increased 12% led by Club Social, Oreo and Halls.
In Asia-Pacific, organic revenue grew 5.8% including 4.1 points from vol-mix and 1.7 points from pricing.
Double-digit growth in emerging market drove the region's top-line performance. China and India led the way. China
grew more than 20% due to solid growth in biscuits and contributions from Stride gum. Since launching last August,
Stride has been a strong performer already capturing about five points of market share. China also gained share in
biscuits behind Oreo and Chips Ahoy! although biscuit category trends softened this quarter. In India, our business was
up double digits. Though certainly not bad, both growth and share continue to be tempered by capacity constraints in
chocolate. We look forward to a return to faster growth as new production lines come on stream by midyear.
At that point, we'll be better able to meet the demands of a chocolate category that's growing over 20%. In contrast to
strong growth in emerging markets, the region's developed markets declined low single digit. This was largely due to a
double-digit decrease in gum in Japan. Overall, the region's Power Brands grew more than 20% led by Stride, Tang,
Oreo, and Cadbury Dairy Milk.
In EEMEA, organic revenue grew 4% driven by strong vol/mix gains of 7.4 percentage points. These gains were
partially offset, however, by lower coffee and chocolate pricing in Russia and other your Eastern European markets.
Russia continued to improve sequentially despite this pricing pressure. Revenue rose 2% overall with vol/mix up about
nine points offset by seven points of lower pricing. We're very encouraged with the progress of our new management
team. In addition to revenue rebounding, shares are also recovering in biscuits and gum. Coffee and chocolate,
however, still have room to improve.
In addition to Russia, other countries in the region including Ukraine, Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa also contributed
meaningfully to growth in the quarter. Power Brands grew 8% led by double-digit growth in Cadbury Dairy Milk,
Oreo, Barni, Tuc and Tang.
Turning to Europe, organic revenue increased modestly as strong vol/mix was mostly offset by lower coffee pricing. In
fact, lower coffee revenues reduced Europe's overall growth by more than two points. Vol/mix was especially strong in
biscuits, chocolate and on-demand coffee. Power Brands increased 3%. In biscuits, vol/mix gains drove mid to
high-single digit growth led by continued strength of belVita, Oreo and a chocobakery platform. In fact, chocobakery is

on track to cross the $250 million mark this year. Biscuits also delivered strong share performance across Europe with
notable gains in France and Italy.
In chocolate, revenues rose mid-single digits nearly all due to vol/mix. Sales were strong across Continental Europe.
Milka led the way, up double digits behind a successful Easter season and strong marketing efforts. We also gained
share in Germany and other key markets. In the U.K., revenue was down modestly as we cycled last year's successful
Bubbly launch.
Coffee revenues declined mid to high single digits due to significantly lower coffee pricing. In addition to the impact of
lower prices, roast and ground volume also fell due to the timing of some promotional activities. That said, Tassimo
grew nearly 30% behind significant marketing support and revenue for Millicano soluble coffee rose 35%.
Gum and candy revenues decreased high single digits. Nearly all of that was due to poor performance in gum. The gum
category continued to decline across Europe. Unfortunately, our share performance was also soft as competitors
stepped up promotional activity and private label gained share in southern Europe. We're just beginning to implement
some of the gum initiatives here that have been successful elsewhere in the world.
In candy, Halls grew double digits and indulgent candy did well, but overall candy revenues were down slightly as we
continue to de-emphasize lower margin SKUs.
In North America, organic revenues increased 2.4% with a good balance of 1.5 points from pricing and 0.9 from
vol/mix. Strong performance in biscuits drove solid growth across the region. In the U.S., biscuits grew mid-single
digits for the seventh quarter in a row as our focused DSD sales force continued to increase distribution points. As a
result, we gained 80 basis points of share in biscuits year-to-date.
There were several stars among our U.S. Power Brands in the quarter. Chips Ahoy! was up high-teens behind increased
distribution, improved velocities and innovation; belVita also continued its strong performance, up low-teens. Honey
Maid and Triscuits each delivered strong growth, driven by innovation and solid performance in the base business. And
Oreo generated double-digit growth despite lapping strong performance a year ago related to the brand's 100th
birthday. U.S. gum and candy fell about 10% overall due to gum weakness. As Irene mentioned, gum was down
sharply as the decline in the category accelerated.
Finally, our Canada business stabilized in the first quarter. It was up low single digits as we resolved the sales
disruptions resulting from the spin.
Turning now to profits, adjusted gross profit on a constant currency basis increased 3.9% in the first quarter. This was
driven by strong vol/mix gains. In addition, we were able to fully offset higher input costs through pricing. Gains were
broad-based as adjusted gross profit at constant currency increased in each region. This provided the fuel for growth
investments. Adjusted gross margin was flat to the prior year at 37.2%. Adjusted operating income on a constant
currency basis was down 4%. This was largely due to cycling the net benefit of one-time items in the prior year.
Excluding this impact, adjusted OI at constant currency was only down modestly. As Irene noted earlier, we reinvested
our higher gross profit to fortify and expand our position in emerging markets.
Adjusted operating income margin was 10.3% in the quarter. The decline of 160 basis points reflects 60 points from the
devaluation of net monetary assets in Venezuela, 40 points from cycling the prior year one-time items and the balance
from a variety of factors including the increased investments in growth initiatives.
Turning now to earnings per share. Diluted EPS was $0.32 and operating EPS was $0.34, up nearly 10%. On a constant
currency basis, operating EPS was up more than 20%. Stepped-up investments in growth initiatives resulted in a $0.01
decline to operating earnings. Cycling the net impact of the prior year one-time items was also a $0.01 drag. As a
result, the increase in operating EPS was attributable to a positive impact of $0.09 from lower taxes, about $0.07 of
which is from discrete items.
Turning to our 2013 guidance. On the top-line, we continue to expect organic net revenue growth at the low end of our
long-term 5% to 7% guidance. As we've outside – as we've outlined previously, we expect growth in the first half to be

around 3.5%. Similar to Q1, global copper (sic) [coffee] prices and capacity constraints will continue to temper growth
in the second quarter. However, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of the year as we begin to
cycle the impact of lower copper (sic) [coffee] pricing in the third quarter and as new capacity comes on stream
midyear. We increased our operating EPS outlook to $1.55 to $1.60. This represents an increase of $0.03 from our
previous guidance as we flow through about half of the $0.07 tax benefit from discrete items. Since it's still early in the
year and considering the volatility of many of our markets, we're holding the other half in reserve at this time.
Let me make one last point on our EPS outlook. As you may recall, this range reflects average 2012 foreign exchange
rates as well as an estimated negative $0.04 impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. Of course,
currency rates will vary from the average 2012 rates that our operating guidance uses. Based on currency impacts
recorded to date and spot rates as of April 30, our EPS would be about $0.03 lower than the $1.55 to $1.60 guidance.
We'll continue to provide you with forex sensitivities as the year unfolds.
With that, let me now turn the call back to Irene for some concluding remarks.
Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Dave. Although our results were in line with expectations, we're certainly not satisfied with our revenue
growth this quarter, but the underlying fundamentals of our business are solid. Our emerging markets continue to
improve sequentially. Vol/mix gains and Power Brands drove high-quality top-line growth. Our biscuits, chocolate and
candy categories continue to post strong revenue and share. And adjusted gross profit grew globally enabling us to step
up our investments in emerging markets. We'll continue to build on this momentum as our growth accelerates in the
back half of the year.
Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar of
Barclays.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good afternoon, everybody.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Andrew.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: I guess my first question is I realize you invested back much of the discrete tax benefit in the
quarter to drive future top-line growth and that accounted for some of the EBIT shortfall, I guess, versus where sort of
many investor models were. I guess my question is regarding that the balance between operating profits and top-line
growth and whether, I guess, the two can coexist going forward given the Street view that there's a significant margin
opportunity to be had or perhaps do they prove mutually exclusive just for some period of time until you get the
top-line moving to where you want it to be?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: There's a couple of questions in there, Andrew. Let me start by saying the money we
reinvested in our emerging markets is from operating earnings, it is not from the tax benefits. We have not reinvested
that money, as Dave mentioned. We've dropped half way to the bottom-line and we're holding the balance in reserve.
Just it's early in the year and we want to make sure that we keep our powder dry. But most importantly as you asked
this question about the balance between margin and growth – and top-line growth, I'd ask you first of all to not
overreact to a single quarter especially given the strong margin performance we had last year. If you recall, we grew
about 70 basis points.

We certainly can expand margin and drive top tier growth. We've done it in the past, and in fact our long-term guidance
assumes that we're going to do it in the future. But the race is clearly on for us and our competitors to fortify and
expand our positions in these fast-growing and highly contested emerging markets. And so we've chosen to reinvest
some of the upside that we've got in the EU and North America to strengthen our position in these emerging markets
and stage our future sustainable growth. I want to remind you though that these investments are all built into our
guidance and we're still in that guidance calling for a double-digit increase in operating EPS. So net-net, there does not
need to be a trade-off. There does need to be a balance and I think we're striking the appropriate balance.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just as a last one. The increased reinvestments that you're
doing, I assume that's meant to be part of the ongoing base going forward as opposed to sort of a one-time increase in
investment. I'm just thinking about next year as you lap some of this higher spending and then what, I guess, potentially
could also be a higher tax rate, how that flows into 2014.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, it is just part of the base. Again, I wouldn't overreact to one quarter. We've given
guidance on the year of $1.55 to $1.60. To get to that range, we're going to need to see significant progress in our OI.
Obviously, quarter one isn't typical of the year for a lot of reasons we talked about. But we're on track with the
guidance we gave for the year. Those investments were already assumed within that guidance. And I think the key
really is you need to see the revenue growth pick up in the back half so that we deliver that top-line guidance in the
back half and then that will drop through to the bottom. But this isn't a one-timer that you need to worry about as you
look at 2014.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow up first on Andrew's
question regarding the tax rate going forward. Dave, can you just first give us an update on where we stand for full year
tax rate guidance? And then...
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: ...given that the realization of one-time items seems to have set the bar fairly low this
year, as we think forward to 2014, 2015 and what you would consider a normalized tax rate, how should we think about
the risk that this could potentially impact your ability to meet constant currency EPS targets over the next year or two?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Okay. Yeah, as we said, we're $0.09 favorable in the quarter but $0.07 of that was from
discrete items. The other $0.02 was a base tax and that was already built in the guidance. So that $0.07 is favorable on
the year and that would drop our tax rate from around 20% to sort of the high side of mid-teens, but that mid-teens
range. And we would expect as I sit here today for that to drop through in the year. So you're right. We'll have a lower
tax rate this year than we'd originally anticipated.
As we look into next year, we've given you a long-term tax rate of 25% and that's nothing more than the mathematical
average of the statutory tax rates around the globe. That's still the right long-term tax rate but I think as we're working
through the impacts of the spin and how our capital structure will evolve with that over time and we unwind some
things, it's going to take us two or three years to get there.
So I think – I'm looking as I sit here today at 2014 probably being closer to the 20% we were originally targeting this
year. So there will be a headwind but it's not going be as big as you're probably worried about and it's probably going to
be at that 20% rate plus or minus a point or two for the next two or three years before we start to see it migrate up to
that 25%. So I hope that helps.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: That does. Thanks, Dave. And then – sorry, just on the phasing of first half sales
growth, can you help us think a little bit more about any discrete impacts that could weigh on second quarter organic

sales growth, because your guidance seems to imply stronger organic sales in the first quarter versus the second quarter
despite having a much tougher prior year comparison. So are there any other factors besides what you called out
explicitly in the presentation?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No. In fact, we actually have easier comps in the back half if you look at the year ago base.
But I think a couple of ways to think about it. If you exclude the coffee and capacity constraints that we've talked
about, we're already in the mid-5%s. And so we're quite comfortable that the underlying business – and I've talked a lot
about the underlying quality of our results. We're quite comfortable that the underlying quality of our business is quite
strong and we feel quite confident about the back half of the year.
We've got the solid underlying momentum driven by good share performance, solid volume/mix performance, strong
performance of our Power Brands, our categories continue to grow. We will be lapping the coffee pricing. Our new
production capacity will come on stream and then, as I mentioned, of course, we've got low comps in the back half of
the year. So net-net, we're quite confident that the back half will accelerate and that we will deliver the guidance of – at
the low end of the 5% to 7% range for the full year.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks, Irene, and I apologize, one very quick clarification. So for the first
quarter, was there any Easter timing benefit that would have resulted in – that would have flattered the rate of organic
sales growth?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Not really because Easter was really early last year. It was a little earlier this year but given
the time that we have to ship to our customers, it really didn't move any volume into Q1. As you look into 2014, you
will see a shift between quarter one and quarter two as it goes back to normal timing, but this year versus last year, not
really. We had a big plus last year. This year it's kind of neutral.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks again, everyone.

Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good evening, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: You made a reference to potential volatility in global markets as one of the reasons that
you wanted to keep your powder dry with the guidance for this year. Could you maybe talk a little bit about where your
biggest concerns are around that and has that got worse over the course of the last couple of months?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah – there's nothing really specific. I mean the reason we kept half of it in reserve is
basically because it's only quarter one and we're a global company. We operate in a lot of markets where there's a lot
going on. We're in Nigeria, Egypt, all parts of the GCC, Argentina, Venezuela. These are all sizable businesses which
we're doing very well in, but stuff could happen. So I mean it's not a specific risk. Frankly, even on the tax line, we had
discrete items go in our favor. We could have discrete items go against us. So it's more a question of just being prudent.
At this point in the year, there's nothing specific that I would call out and worry about. It's just being prudent given
we're really only talking about the first quarter right now.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Thank you. And then maybe as a follow-up, you mentioned that India managed to grow
low double digits despite the capacity constraints in chocolate. Was that driven by Oreos and Tang and their launch, I
guess, almost a couple of years ago now? Does that mean that India is almost $1 billion business now that those new
businesses or new product launches have hit a run rate of about $100 million or so, just want to make sure I got the
math right on that.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Actually, no, Alexia. The bulk of our growth in India was driven by chocolate. As Dave
mentioned, we took a number of steps. We are short on capacity, but we took a number of steps to stretch the capacity

that we've got and we're continuing to push as we bring that capacity on stream for the back half of the year. We have
high expectations for Oreo in India, but, frankly, that's still a very small business and we'll see that play out as the year
progresses and then into next year.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Okay. Thank you very much. Yeah.
<A - David A. Brearton>: It's about an $800 million business right now, so it's in that range. While we've been
growing nicely, the currency has been moving against us. So it hasn't actually moved much in reported U.S. dollars.

Your next question comes from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good evening. Irene, I'm a little bit surprised that gum continues to drive down results in
developed markets. I understand it's a structurally challenged category, but at what point – and you only expect
improvement two, three years from now, but at what point do you expect at least stabilization?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well look, as I mentioned, we are not taking this sitting down. We continue to test a
number of initiatives and we've got a number of ideas out in the marketplace. I mentioned the areas that we're focused
on, price/size architecture, hard-hitting advertising, focused on more functional benefits like oral care. We're making
great progress in driving placement of high-impact displays. In markets like Japan, for example, we've got about 13,000
convenience stores that now have countertop displays and we're seeing a 20% to 25% uplift there.
And lastly, the most important action is getting the right product assortment at retail. And as I mentioned, that's an area
that we have been focused on. It does depend on when our customers reset their shelves. But we are starting to see
some early signs of success and as we look at markets like the U.S., for example, you will not have seen the April
shares yet, but when you see them, you will see our share is up about almost two points. So we're starting to see some
impact from these actions. I have great confidence that they will start to turn the tide, but most importantly, I want to
make it clear, as I've said a couple of times, that we're not counting on that turnaround in the guidance that we've given.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Right. And then maybe if I can ask one more question. You mentioned capacity constraints in
several markets and two quarters ago we had price cap issues in markets like Russia and Brazil. Do you feel like at
least in some markets you have a management issue?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No. I think – we talked about the fact that we were slow to respond in Russia and I am quite
pleased with the turnaround that we've now seen in the Russian market, and we've talked about those results. They are
quite strong, if you look at them in aggregate, it's only up about 2% but it's quite a sequential improvement from where
we were and underneath that very strong volume/mix in response to the initiatives that we put in there. And so I feel
quite comfortable with the teams that we've got.
We have some capacity issues. As I mentioned at CAGNY, these capacity issues – you might say, how could you not
have known, but before we bought Cadbury, India, for example, was growing about 10%. We increased our marketing
support. We saw it grow 20%, 30% and by the time we finished our programming, it was growing 40%. And so despite
our most aggressive assumptions about growth in markets like India, we just underestimated it. We are on track to
bring that new capacity on stream mid-year into the back half of the year, but it's one of those nice problems to have.
And as we've said, the major impact – the major dampening impact on our first half results is coffee pricing. So yes,
capacity plays an impact but the major effect has been coffee pricing and the decline that we have taken there in
response to the input costs.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: First question, just, Dave, on the Venezuela – the currency hit in Venezuela. Is it a write-down
of just cash that was sitting on the bank? Just what's the nature of sort of the hit that you took in the P&L?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, that's part of it. I mean, there's really three pieces to the Venezuela impact, two of
them we've called out as the currency impact. One of them we're just saying is regular operating. So the net monetary
assets as you rightly state, we're on hyperinflation accounting as is everybody else, so we have to write those down and
that was written down and we're calling that part of that $0.04 impact. And obviously, the Venezuelan bolivar earnings
we make get translated back at a less favorable exchange rate. So that's the second piece.
So those are both in the $0.04. There's other impacts around the input cost just went up a lot based on the currency
shift, so it costs a lot more bring stuff into the country. We've got a price, there's some liquidity problems with
customers, we're having to push through stuff, all of that is just regular operating and we're covering that within the
regular part of our business. So the pieces that are in the $0.04 are really just those two, the write-down and the dollar
translation.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: And so as we kind of model it going forward, assuming that there wasn't another devaluation,
the level of impact should lessen as we go through the rest of the year?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yes. So in fact, those two items really should be – the biggest chunk was the monetary asset
write-down.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Right.
<A - David A. Brearton>: And that is a one-time item. So the translation is much less of an impact.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. All right, thanks. And then I guess just one other question and maybe it's a follow-up to
Andrew's question, Irene, but I think there's been a lot written in the last six weeks about kind of what Mondelez should
do in the future and whether it's merge with Frito-Lay or focus more on margin expansion and there's been quite a bit of
scrutiny just on whether the level of overheads at Mondelez are too high. Certainly, you're investing more right now
and actually trying to build out infrastructure in markets where it sounds like it's pretty competitive to get the rate of
investment or get the investments in ahead of your competitor. So to the extent that you can, can you just talk to that
topic of kind of how you feel about the strategy you have now, the goals you have now, why they are the right ones and
just kind of talk to this debate I guess that's going on in the market?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah. There's no question there's lots of chatter out there and I'm not going to comment on
the chatter. But what I will tell you is we have created a very unique business with tremendous opportunities for growth
as we watch consumer demand for snacks growing at a very healthy rate around the world, and we capitalize on our
strong positions, especially in these emerging markets. Again, one of the premises for the split of our company was the
opportunity to focus on snacking and to leverage our position in these emerging markets. We are driving shareholder
returns, we will drive shareholder returns by focusing on top-tier revenue and EPS growth, but that does not preclude
margin expansion. So we will continue to see top and bottom-line growth, while at the same time, we will see margin
expansion. As we've said before, the margin opportunities are clearly bigger in North America and Europe and we're
going to take some of that money to drop some of that to the bottom-line and we'll take some of that to reinvest. But all
of that investment is captured in our guidance that we've given and we will still enable us to deliver double-digit EPS
growth. We do believe, though, that these emerging markets that the time is now to make sure that we fortify our
positions in these rapidly growing markets and that's why we're choosing to do that.

<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Has that urgency to step up the investment in emerging markets intensified at all over the last
year?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No. In fact, I would say it was one of the main reasons for splitting the company. It was our
opportunity to focus exclusively on using that opportunity to expand our position. So it was very much a part of our
overall thesis. It will pay dividend, I know it is challenging to see the impact of these investments at this point because
of some of the headwinds we've talked about. But you will start to see it play through in the back half of the year and it
certainly will play through in the sustainable growth that we will generate.

Your next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi. Good evening, everybody.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Hey, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: A couple of questions I guess following up on Bryan's point. I think on the devaluation, is it
most of the time that companies will take the write down of the assets and the hyperinflation into something like
between operating income and pre-tax as opposed to the segment. It appears that you're putting the full impact into the
segment. Is that accurate?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think it is accurate. We called it the currency impact and I think that is consistent
with what I've seen other companies do, but we did leave it within the Latin America segment. And that's why you see
the operating income margin because on a reported basis, it's within operating income and it shows there as a
significant write-down. So, yes, it's in that segment.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: So if there are other devaluations such as Argentina that are material, that's also going to run
through your segment line as opposed to after EBIT?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, it would flow through the segment line. Venezuela's the only material country that's
on hyperinflation, so the write-down of net monetary assets really is a unique Venezuela issue unless inflation gets high
enough in places like Argentina to get us into hyperinflation. But as of today, they're still at normal accounting.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Then the next question I think, Dave, you said that there was a 50 basis point drag due
to a lack of capacity, I guess, focused in EM? Is that – and that was less than you expected? Is that accurate?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, yeah, back in CAGNY, we had estimated that the capacity constraints would temper
our growth by up to a full point. It's down to about one half a point mostly because we've spent a lot of effort with the
supply chain folks stretching the capacity, getting some efficiencies and de-bottlenecking but also frankly, only selling
the SKUs that matter and really focusing on fewer SKUs and fewer changeovers. So that's helped us stretch it out and
got the impact down to about 0.5 point. As Irene mentioned, we would expect even that impact to disappear in the back
half of the year because we've got the new lines coming on, we've got some co-mans stepping up and we'd expect that
impact to disappear for the back half.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: So to get to the second half acceleration which arguably has to be sales growth of, let's call it,
6%, 7%, the drag has to go obviously from not being a drag to a contribution. So can you kind of give a sense as to how
much capacity is actually being added that will, let's say, bridge the gap versus to get to such a fast growth rate?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think if you...
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Like if you shift to consumption, how much is that going to really add?

<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, if we shift to consumption, it really is only that 0.5 point. We're going to be putting
in more capacity because frankly, we want to get ahead of it. And that's why we talked about in CAGNY we're going to
step up our capital expenditures closer to the 5% of revenue for the next couple of years. So we're going to try to get in
front of it but adding more capacity can't help you sell faster than consumption. So we'll get the 0.5 point back. I think
as you get into the back half, I mean there's a few things to think about. The coffee headwind was 1.3 points this
quarter and probably similar next quarter. That's going to disappear in the back half.
The capacity is 0.5 point. That's going to disappear in the back half. If you added those on alone, you're already up to
mid-5. And then on top of that, we've got good underlying share momentum probably the best we've seen in years.
Vol/mix was very strong, categories are growing a little less than historically but still very strong growth in our
categories and frankly we have pretty easy comps – comp periods in the back half as well. So you add all that together
getting the six to seven range, we're pretty confident in.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then on the guidance, so are you saying that with currency where it is today even,
I guess, including currency of a $0.03 headwind and also including the benefit of the taxes assuming you spend back
half that you're not actually changing guidance?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Well, we've gone through a mechanism of giving you guidance on a constant currency basis
of the prior year average rates and then giving you sensitivity around that. We did increase that constant currency
guidance by $0.03 due to the taxes and passing through half of that discrete benefit, that's true. It is a total coincidence
that today at spot currency would be a $0.03 headwind and would bring us back down that $0.03. But I think it's only
May 7, so I won't overreact to the currency markets. They'll be what they'll be and we'll give you a sensitivity every
quarter as to how that stand. As we get closer to the end of the year, we'll be able to lock in on a firm number. But we'll
give you a constant currency guidance and we'll give you a sensitivity every quarter based on where we sit today.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then last question, I apologize. Irene, obviously, at least in China, big market,
Mars has something like 40% to 50% of the chocolate market over there. A lot of other players fighting it out. You're
trying to be aggressive by getting your fair share as quickly as possible. But why shouldn't we be concerned that those
who are fighting it out are going to struggle with returns? I mean Hershey has already kind of stacked off a little bit on
their long-term assumptions about operating margins in the – in their emerging markets. So I guess, why isn't it going
to be a pretty big challenge for all these chocolate players to try to capture profitability in the market?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, let me start by saying we're not in chocolate in China. So our category participation in
China is primarily biscuits and then we've overlaid gum. And as I talked earlier, we feel very good about the biscuit
performance, we continue to have the number one biscuits in the country and Oreo growth continues to be very solid.
And our biscuit business grew double-digit in the first quarter. Our overall China business is about $1 billion. It grew
about 20% and the incremental benefit there came from gum. As you recall last August, we launched Stride gum in
China. China is the second largest gum market in the world. It's growing 16% annually. Every time I keep talking about
challenges in gum, it's in the developed markets. Developing markets are growing at quite healthy rates and China is
one of them.
And I would say our early results – we feel quite good about our early results. We've got a share – about 5% share and
it's certainly performing consistent with our expectations and we view this entry as very complementary to our biscuit
business because in effect, we're basically putting gum on top of the biscuit infrastructure.
So we feel quite good about the performance of our business in China today. We continue to make investments in
route-to-market and expanding our participation in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities, investing in more in the traditional trade
all of which have very attractive paybacks because our gross margins in China are quite good. In fact, they're among
the highest in the world. So China is a strong market for us. It has performed well. We have every confidence it will
continue to perform well and we will invest behind that growth to fuel the overall momentum.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Thanks for that. I'll pass it on.
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: Hey, guys. Let me just step in. Hey, if we can just keep the number of questions like one or
a half per person we can try to get to everybody as much as we can. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good afternoon. Good evening.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Just had a question for you. In the quarter, were your input costs favorable to the
gross margin? So were input costs actually deflationary in the quarter overall? I'm guessing with coffee being down
that was a big driver, I'm just curious overall?
<A - David A. Brearton>: No. Actually, our input costs overall were about up 1% so pretty small and coffee is the
reason they were small. Within our input costs commodities are clearly one of the drivers but as a global company now
actually a bigger driver is currency rates and the cost it costs to bring materials into the individual markets where we
sell and a lot of other minor raw materials that we buy locally. So commodity costs are by far not our biggest piece. If I
look at those, you're right, they're slightly down but the overall aggregate input costs was up about 1%. Probably the
lowest inflation we've seen in quite a while but it was a slight increase.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And just as a follow-on question to that, are you seeing markets where it's
getting more promotional in some of your categories? And also kind of pushing towards gum, is that a category where
you also are getting more promotional even sequentially to try and turn that category around?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I don't think we're seeing a material change in the promotional activity. Markets have
been kind of in a far subdued state in the developed world for quite a while and we maintained our discipline. I think
most of the food industry did. Gum, there has been more promotion, we talked about that in Europe and we're
responding to that but that's really more of an isolated circumstance. I would not say promotional intensity has
increased at this stage.

Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: To follow up on Matt Grainger's question, I think he was asking about the second quarter not
necessarily the second half. I'm curious about this too. I'm still not sure I understand. To get to your guidance of 3.5%
organic growth in the first half, you have to put out a lower organic growth number in 2Q than 1Q. And I guess I'm not
sure why that is, right? You have a much easier comparison, there's no change in the coffee impact, there's no Easter
issue. So again, maybe you've talked about this but are there some headwinds I'm not necessarily thinking about that hit
your top-line this current period?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I think we're talking about 20 basis points or 30 basis points gap. So simplistically, we gave
you guidance of 3.5% for the first half. 3.8% is above that but not materially above that. We left the guidance for the
first half at 3.5%. I wouldn't over think it.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: All right. It implies 3.2%. Then some people would call that meaningful but I'll move on. As
you look at your – Dave, as you look at your weighted average interest rate, it's high versus the group, right? It's the
second highest of any company I'm covering. You've talked in the past about a lot of your debt being non-callable and
of course the high cash cost associated with restructuring that debt and I understand that. I guess I'm just curious if

maybe you can update us on your current thoughts and whether they've changed at all regarding what, at least on the
outside seems be arguably a less than optimal debt structure?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, the interest costs are very high, I mean all of that debt was taken out really for the
Danone acquisition and the Cadbury acquisition. So they were taken out at the time that at the time I'm sure look
reasonable and today it looks high. We paid off some debt in February as we scheduled. We said we would pay off the
February debt. That's done. We said we would pay off the May debt. There's $1 billion coming due actually tomorrow.
So that'll be paid off and that'll get us down to that sort of $17.5 billion debt level that we said was kind of our
equilibrium. There's another $1.8 billion that is due in October and we're obviously evaluating options for that.
As you think about tenders or other things that would buy back some that high cost debt, the reality is it's a pay me now
or pay me later. I could buy it back but I'm going to have to pay the bondholders the net present value of that high
interest costs. So the criteria I've established with my treasury group is it needs to be net present value positive for it to
be worth their while to do with debt buyback and that means that it continues to be the criteria. That doesn't mean we
won't do it. It doesn't mean we will but that's the test I will continue to apply. And in the end, we haven't executed a
tender so far but if we decide that the economics actually work in our favor at some point, we'll move forward.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Well, I appreciate that. And I will let it go in one sec. I would just suggest that perhaps
shareholders should come first, right? Stockholders come before bondholders in this kind of situation and if you can
drive your EPS significantly higher by paying down some – or restructuring some debt which you probably could. And
we would exclude the expenses as non-recurring at least from our vantage point you can get your stock higher and do
an awful lot of things with that in terms of acquisitions and so forth. So just my friendly two cents there.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from David Palmer of UBS.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good evening, guys.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, David.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: I'd love to dig into the puts and takes in the quarter with regard to margins. It sounds like
global chocolate and biscuits had a solid revenue quarter with relatively higher margin Power Brands doing
significantly better than those categories. And you mentioned that the overall inflation of your input is about 1%.
Obviously, gum was weak and that's a high margin business and you had a tougher margin comparison this quarter. But
is there any more detail you can give us with regard to margin drags or reinvestments that happened in the quarter that
seem to offset these other areas that would speak to tailwinds? Thanks.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Sure. I guess I'd start by saying I wouldn't overreact to margins in a single quarter and
particularly this quarter had a lot of noise in it. We came off a year when we grew margin by 70 basis points so we had
a very strong year. And I think this year in total, we still expect to have a good year. If you start and look at our
margins, our gross margins were flat and at 37.2% and you rightly point out gum actually hit us within that because
gum is a higher margin product by about 50 basis points. We also have the price adjustments we made in Eastern
Europe and Russia. That hit us as well and we covered that by continuing to be pretty discipline around pricing and
input costs and productivity in the rest of the world.
So the flat margin is a really a decline in a couple situations but overall continued progress on gross margins. The
reason the OI margin was down was, as I said on the call, it was the Venezuelan bolivar with a one-time impact this
year. It was prior year items that kind of set up an artificially high base of 40 bps that we talked about last year. It was
just synergies. We haven't talked about the synergies much but we said we had $200 million of the synergies coming
out of the spin and we said we'd eliminate half of that this year which we will.

But inevitably, the savings are going to come out more towards the back half and the full impact of those synergies hit
us in the first quarter. And it was the investments in emerging markets that we talked about in A&C and sales and
route-to-market. So those are kind of the drivers. As I look at that whole bucket of events, we're holding gross margin
despite some headwinds and we'd expect to continue to do that. We'll continue to invest in our emerging market growth
that these synergies will disappear. So we are on track to hit our total year guidance, and I'm not worried about the first
quarter. I know it looks bad on paper, and it is in isolation. It clearly is. But I think you will see that margin pick up
more in the back half, less so in the second quarter but I think the back half margins will improve significantly. And
you'll see that in delivery of the full year.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll keep it to my one and a half questions. I feel like I'm
beating a bit of a dead horse here, but I want to build on some of Driscoll's questions and back to Chris Growe's as
well. On gross margins, you said price growth of around 1.3% inflation of 1%, mathematically that alone should be
giving you some margin expansion, add-in volume leverage and then your productivity, mathematically, we should've
seen much better gross margins. I think you gave 50 basis points offset on gum weakness. Can you help illuminate us
to what the other offsets were?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, the other two big offsets would be the coffee and chocolate pricing adjustment we
did in Russia and Eastern Europe. And it would also be the Argentinean price controls, where inflation is running
significantly higher than the price controls right now. We haven't been able to take any pricing this year. Those would
be the two biggest offsets plus the gum.
<Q - Jason English>: So the coffee it's not included in your inflation and price numbers for the overall company?
<A - David A. Brearton>: The coffee pricing, we're managing fairly well. So coffee pricing is down. Coffee margins
are okay.
<Q - Jason English>: And this is my other half question. You gave A&C of 9.6% of revenue for this quarter. What
was it last year?
<A - David A. Brearton>: 9.4%.
<Q - Jason English>: Thank you very much.

We have time...

Okay. Your final question comes from David Driscoll of Citi.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Great. Thank you for getting me in there. I feel like I got into the wire although it's past the
hour. Want to make one clarification. When you guys were saying that OI was in line with your expectation and it
allowed the SG&A in that reinvestments, I believe I think I have that correct, and then this tax benefit, the zero tax paid
in the quarter, you're saying that that's not the reason for the SG&A investment that this is outside of that, and then

you're talking about part of this then gets contributed to the guidance raise. Did I say that about right?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yes, you did. Again, we gave full year guidance and on a full year basis, we expect our
EPS to be $1.55 to $1.60 and that will be well into double-digits EPS growth. Within that, we've got the tax benefit that
we dropped $0.02 to $0.03, and we've got OI is going to have to grow. So we gave a full year estimate on OI growth
and our top-line behind that. It is going to require margin improvement. We never gave you operating margin guidance
for quarter one. So quarter one was in line with what we'd expect internally. We knew about the one-time hit we have,
and we knew about the investments we would be making all through the year. So the fact that those would hit us more
in the first quarter because we don't have that revenue leverage yet.
And so it's more about as we go through the year, we get the top-line growth accelerating. That will translate into
leverage down through the P&L. You'll see that margin gain come through. And so that's why the quarter one margin in
isolation is not great, and it's certainly below what you guys would have expected. It is part of a full year guidance and
there's nothing in there that should lead you to be concerned about the full year. It's really consistent with the guidance
we gave back in February.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Very helpful. On China, the 20% growth is pretty encouraging. Do you think that type of
growth rate can be sustained throughout the remaining quarters of the year?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: The simple answer is yes, David. I mean probably not exactly at 20% but we've been
growing healthily in – at those rates for the last couple of years, and I have every expectation. We've got good category
growth. We're in good categories in the country. I talked about the performance of both biscuits and gum. We feel we're
seeing very strong performance there. We've seen some slowdown in GDP, but it has not disproportionately affected
our categories. Even biscuit when it quote, slowed down grew at a healthy 11% rate over the last 52 weeks. So our
share performance continues to be strong. We've got strong brands in our – both our biscuit and in our gum portfolios,
and we continue to make investments as I mentioned in marketing support and route-to-market as well as in broadening
our distribution base. So I feel quite confident about the future and the fact that China will continue to be a key
contributor to our overall growth rate.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Terrific. Can I switch over to just two final questions? New product...
<A - David A. Brearton>: One. One.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: They're two good ones, though. They're really good ones. The new products, we don't hear
from you guys about like new products as a percentage of revenues, and this I think is a key metric that you look at
internally. Can you update us on your thoughts on new products as a percent of revenues? And the final question is,
Dave, maybe you can just give us some understanding as to what's the holdup with the arbitration proceedings with
Starbucks? Hasn't it been like 10 or 11 months since we've gone through this thing? And why aren't we getting a
verdict?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I'll let Dave answer that one and I'll come back to your question about innovation.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, on Starbucks, we remain pretty confident in our case. We are looking forward to the
verdict as much as you are, probably more than you are. There's really nothing new since our last call. We're awaiting
the decision. You are correct, the arbitration hearings finished in August of last year. But there's no specific timing. It's
really at the discretion of the arbiter. So we're pretty confident in the outcome. We're pretty confident in the merits of
our case. But we can't dictate the timing.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: With respect to innovation, David, the – we feel pretty good about the performance of our
innovation, particularly our global platforms. It represents about 12% or 13% of revenue, and we believe that that's
quite high relative to peers. And the drivers of that within each of the categories are the platform innovations behind
each of our Power Brands. And so as I've talked about the performance of Power Brands, and I talk about Cadbury
Dairy Milk or Milka growth, it's coming because of products like Bubbly. When I talk about biscuit growth, it's coming
from Oreo and belVita, for example, and when we talk about our gum growth, we're seeing continued improvement as
we focus our Trident franchise on breath freshening. So that's the source of this innovation. It is an important
