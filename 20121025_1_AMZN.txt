reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons
in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow
increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion.
Return on invested capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average
total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The
combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares consistent with 469 million
shares.
Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion or 30% excluding the $348 million unfavorable impact from
year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low
prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56
billion, up 36% or 39% excluding foreign exchange.
Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales, up from 58%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active
customer accounts exceeded 188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units
represented 41% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion or 74.7% of
revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.26 billion
or 23.6% of sales up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.45 billion or 10.5% of revenue
compared with 10%.
Tech and content was $1.08 billion or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million or 3.8% of
revenue compared with 3.3%.
Now I'll you will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our
stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM
revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 61%.
North America segment operating income increased 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin.
In the international segment revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion. Adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign
exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%.
Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5
billion or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues up from 54%.
International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116
million.
CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year-over-year.
Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 10%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating
expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million or 0.2% negative operating margin compared with GAAP operating
income of $79 million.

Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared with
net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share.
The third quarter of 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity-method share of
the losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets, including
goodwill. As of the end of September the book value of our equity-method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year-over-year to $5.25 billion.
Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion and inventory turns were 9.7, down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we
expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion and accounts payable days increased to 75 days from 72 days in the
prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures were $716 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional
investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including
Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've
to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently
unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate
fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and
therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter company balances and foreign
currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can
all have a material affect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements,
record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain
approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, a growth of between 16% and 31%.
This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss and $310 million income compared to $260 million
income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of
intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other
operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income compared to $462 million income in the
prior year period. We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations including capitalized software development to
be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion.
These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of
investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our
fulfillment operations.
We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased
corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle,
Washington.
We remain head-sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We
believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that Sean, let's move to questions.

Sean Boyle
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how
to initiate a question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. At the time we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first
question comes from Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Hi. Thank you. Two, please, if I could. Tom, first on international margin, I know some of that
actually is affected by currency. And I was wondering, if you could speak to the effect of currency that it's having on
margin. And then secondly, what else is driving that down? I would anticipate China investment – digital in Italy and
Spain being contributors there? And then secondly on shipping revenue up 44% year-over-year, I was wondering if you
could break that down between shipping revenue or more Prime versus the revenue allocation of FBA. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: To take the first part of your question, Scott, as it relates to operating profit in
international, you have the big pieces correct. First one is, we're investing certainly very heavily in capacity and so
you're seeing that both fulfillment and infrastructure capacity that's impacting our results there.
In addition to that we're investing in the number of new geographies. We've talked about Italy and Spain over the last
several calls those are certainly having an impact. We're very excited about the opportunity that we have there, but
certainly those are investments right now. China as you also mentioned is great a long-term opportunity for us, but
certainly an investment and it is impacting that number.
In addition, one that I don't think you did mention was video content for international. We're investing heavily in video
content through our subsidiary LOVEFiLM for Europe. So, those are things that are the primary drivers of what you're
seeing in operating income in international.
In terms of shipping revenue, there's not a lot, I can help you, with there is a number of factors that go into that number.
If you take a look at both the shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost if you will, the net shipping cost
is getting a little bit better over time, as we get closer and closer to customers with our FC footprint. So those are some
of the things. But again a lot of dynamics that are certainly impacting that shipping revenue number.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney, Citi.
<Q - Mark Stephen Mahaney>: Great, thanks. Any comments on the paid unit growth deceleration that seem to have
been relatively significant, anything about the comp or any read into that? And secondly, given all the infrastructure
investments you've made, Tom you just mentioned some of the shipping efficiencies, you're also seeing fulfillment as a
percentage of revenue kind of start narrowing a little bit. Do you think you've reached a bit of a cyclical – investment
cyclical tipping point or am I over reading into just one quarter?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the paid unit growth question it was 39%. As you mentioned, it was a
deceleration from last quarter. Keep in mind still, the 39% growth is still growing at a faster rate than revenue, one.
Two, if you take a look at last year's unit growth in Q3, the 53% that we had, that was the second highest quarter that
we've had in growth rate in the last 10 years. So we're overlapping a very strong growth last quarter.
In terms of fulfillment expense, certainly as we've talked about over the past few years, stepping up very heavily in
2010 and 2011 and 2012. From a fulfillment standpoint, we've just seen unprecedented growth and we've added a lot of

capacity.
In terms of where it will level off? We'll have to wait and see. Right now, we're still experiencing very strong growth,
with 30% growth on a local currency basis, 39% unit growth. So, we're going to continue to invest where we need to
and the fulfillment capacity we do have, we're going to make sure that we operate as efficiently as we can and get more
efficient with that capacity over time.
Operator
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you. I had a question about pop-up stores. It seems like a lot of people are
jumping on the bandwagon there and we've been hearing stuff recently about Amazon trying to leverage those as a way
to get closer to customers and help facilitate shipping for the holiday season. I'm just wondering if you could share with
us your strategy there?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, could you elaborate on what you're referring to? I'm sorry.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: A pop-up store, meaning something that might only be open for between, say, Black Friday
and January 1st. A short term store.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, the vast majority, the highest percentage of our revenue is certainly coming from our
online sales. We do, in the case of Kindle are using a physical world, retailers as well, which we're very happy to do so.
But again, it's not really the driver of our business.
Operator
And we'll take a question now from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas Anmuth>: Thanks for taking the question. Tom, it's been nearly a year since you launched the first Fire
devices and I was hoping you could give us a sense of how that cohort of users might be tracking in terms of their
buyer activity and in particular how you're seeing them, if they are over-indexing in terms of media content
consumption, Prime usage and overall purchasing and how do you feel about that strategy now as you continue to tie
Prime into devices? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Maybe the best way to describe it would be – certainly we're seeing customers certainly
purchasing a lot of content. We like the idea of selling our Kindle Fire and then being rewarded through purchases of
content going forward.
All of that being said even though we're rewarded with those sales, customers realize that we're going to make sure that
we work on behalf of them to make sure that content is not only very wide but also at great prices, and so we continue
to work with – to make sure that we can provide that on our customer's behalf. But we're seeing very good shopping
patterns on all types of content with the selection that we have. We're seeing customers not only purchase content –
we're seeing customers – Prime customers certainly being active in watching free content as well, and that's working
very well. So it's a great combination of things that are going on there and engagement with the device.
Operator
And we'll go next to Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Yes, thank you very much. I actually want to follow up on that question that was just asked.
So, intuitively it makes a lot of sense what it is that you are doing. But can you maybe just speak to the effectiveness of
the selling the device or all of these devices, kind of, near break even maybe. Is there any metric that you can point to

help us understand the lift you get either in terms of the frequency or – of buying or a lift in average transaction value
or anything that could kind of help us gauge from the outside the success of that strategy?
And then second, maybe if you could just speak to the thinking behind your content cost related to your streaming
service going forward? Just how should we be thinking about it? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of – there's not a lot of specifics I can give you on a per device basis from content
standpoint, in terms of what the purchasing patterns have been. But as I mentioned in the previous question, certainly
customers are engaged in a device, they are purchasing content, they are also in the case of video – they're purchasing
content as well as watching free content. In the case of books, they're purchasing books as well as – if they're Prime
members, they're participating in free content.
So those are things that are going very well. We like what we see there which is why we continue to invest in that
business, which is why you see the offerings – the very compelling offerings that we have out there right now. So those
are things that you should expect us to do more of.
In terms of the video content spend – if you're referring to the – related to Prime Instant Video – I think it's probably
what you're referring to. We have added a lot of content. We like what we see so far. We'll continue to monitor very
carefully. You should expect us to add more content going forward.
We launched Prime some number of years ago now and we had a little over a million items at launch. We then
expanded that dramatically with many physical items. We're now offering digital items through Prime as well. Most
notably and certainly in books and video and we're monitoring the performance very closely. But again, so far we're
seeing great new subscribers coming out of these efforts and we like what we see so far.
Operator
And our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Thanks. I know it's still early, but have you seen any noticeable impact from sales in states like
California where they just started lighting you guys up on collecting sales tax?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: You're right, it is early. The only thing I could point to is, we collect in over – either sales
tax or its equivalent value-added tax. We collect and over 50% of our revenue today – we have very good businesses in
those states and geographies that we do that in. So, that's all I can point to today.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Steve Ju>: So good afternoon, guys. So, revisiting the capacity and infrastructure question overseas, anything you
can share in terms of the operating environment and what is required to get the package to the customer? I mean, over
the longer term, are there any particular regions that you think may never reach the efficiency level, as you may
currently see in your older geographies? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We – actually, we feel very good about the investments we're making in fulfillment
capacity. When I think about the types of investments that we're making in terms of predictability, certainly, I would
consider the fulfillment capacity to be more the running of the business type investments. We have a lot of experience
starting up new facilities, operating those efficiently and to the point where, as you know we've extended that not only
to offer that service for our retail business, we also offer that to sellers to fulfill by Amazon.
So, those are things that we feel – certainly those investments we feel good about, but what you are seeing is certainly
just a very large ramp that we've done starting in 2010 through now. And it's one of these investments, we only make
those investments where we absolutely need too, but in terms of deploying that capital and those resources, we feel

very good about it.
Operator
And we'll go next to Brian Nowak of Nomura.
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: Hi, thanks. I have two questions, please. Can you talk to what you saw throughout Europe?
Did you see any weakening in the European markets throughout the quarter? And if so, any comments on any pockets
or countries of weakness? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about social and your use of social networks like
Pinterest? Do you feel comfortable working with other social networks to drive business to Amazon as you are now?
Or do you think over the long-term or time you'd like to have more end-to-end control over social e-commerce?
Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the Europe piece, we're not breaking out any specific countries in terms of
growth. But as you can see from the results, we grew 27% in international and local currency basis, which includes,
obviously, our footprint in Europe as well as China and Japan. So we feel the growth has been in the high-20s to
low-30s over the past several quarters. Certainly, we're reading the same thing that you're reading in terms of the
softness. Hard to tell how much that's impacting us. Again, when you look at 27% growth rates, still think that's pretty
solid in the environment. But again, hard to tell how much we're impacted by that.
In terms of social, we're certainly very – looking at a lot of different ways to reach customers, and certainly that's an
opportunity for us and something that our – certainly our advertising and marketing teams are very conscious of. And
working on ways best to monetize those channels.
Operator
We'll go next to Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Great, guys. Just two quick questions. First is on Brazil, second on fulfillment. So you guys
are hiring in Brazil for local content relationships, for Kindle and some warehouse personnel. So how important do you
view that market in terms of the retail business? When do you think you could be in Brazil with a retail presence? And
then the second question is fulfillment: as a growth – as a percent of gross profit, showed year-on-year leverage for the
first time in like three years. So do you feel like you've turned the corner on some of the capacity improvements? Or
given the pace of new facilities that you're putting in, is there any reason why that would reverse back down again from
here?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the first question, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what
we might or might not do. Certainly, Brazil is an interesting geography, as well as there are others. And we certainly
export to Brazil today. But beyond that, there's not a lot to talk to.
In terms of fulfillment, you are seeing a little bit of leverage in Q3 versus what we've seen in the past few years. Again,
it's one quarter. I wouldn't read too much into that at this stage. But certainly, we feel good about the footprint that we
have. We feel good about a lot of the capacity that we've added since 2010. Some of that capacity, going back, is
getting more productive than it had been. The challenging part is obviously we're layering on a sizable number of FCs
this year on top of that that you're seeing the costs for so, again, the 19 that we've announced today.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Mark Miller of William Blair.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Good afternoon. Could you share what you've learned with the add-on program and the
purchase rate you're seeing? And do you think over time you're going to have a meaningful expansion of smaller ticket

items and can that effect the percent of orders that have multiple items in the shipment?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of add-ons, we're – our goal is to try to make products available to customers that
we aren't – weren't able to make available to before, and so it's very early but that's the – just one additional way that
we can add selection for customers and be able to get it to our customers profitably. So again, there's not much more to
it than that.
Operator
And we'll go now to Herman Leung of Susquehanna.
<Q - Herman Leung>: Great. Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. I guess when you look into your holiday – as you
might go into the holiday season with your third party inventory last year hitting sort of a bump with video games as
well as some of the Thailand floods, I was wondering what types of steps you guys are kind of doing to better prepare
yourselves for a holiday season – this upcoming holiday season? And the second question is, wondering how we should
think about the increasing cost, shipping cost leverage as you go into 2013 with your distribution centers much closer
and a higher percentage of FBA units? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of holiday readiness, we feel very good. We're – as you can see from our
inventory at the end of Q3, it's started. We're adding inventory, getting ready for the holiday season. That will happen
throughout Q4. We're continuing trying to increase our in-stock levels so you're certainly seeing some of that already in
the numbers. And we're very excited about the getting ready for a great holiday season and that's with our own retail
inventory. Certainly we haven't – sellers who are selling on our platform will be doing the same thing. And we're
getting forward to have a great experience for customers during Q4.
In terms of shipping cost leverage, I think there's a great opportunity over a longer period of time. In terms of providing
what would happen from a short term leverage standpoint, it would be premature to do that at this stage. But we can
check-in in future periods and talk more about that.
Operator
And we'll go now to Anthony DiClemente of Barclays.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Hi. Just one question. On the North America media segment, just a modest
deceleration. I would imagine that digital content sales and download to rent probably grew much faster than the
growth rate of that segment. And so I'm just wondering if there's anything specifically that you can call out that was
weighing that growth rate down in that segment, whether it's physical media or otherwise? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Not – I – you've characterized it correctly. Digital content is growing very fast. And it's
reflected in the number that you see there. Beyond that, there's not a lot of call outs with the exception of – if you look
back over the past five quarters, certainly the highest growth we've had would be Q3 of 2011, which we're lapping. So
that's the other factor, but again very good growth on the digital media side. Also keep in mind that that – the growth of
digital will also trail our device sales, and given the new launch that we've had recently, that will be good for digital
content sales going forward.

And we'll take a question from Michael Graham of Canaccord Adams.
<Q - Michael Graham>: Hi. Good afternoon. Tom, last quarter you made a comment that same-day delivery on a
wide scale wasn't a goal. And since then I've got more anecdotal evidence of people getting a lot of same-day delivery
especially here in New York. And there was some news from Walmart that they were going to start shipping from their

stores.
So, could you give us any updated thoughts or philosophy you might have around what's an appropriate amount of time
to strive for to deliver to people? And then as a quick follow-up to that, it seems like every quarter you're guiding to
sort of 1% operating margins and just wondering, like is that a philosophical way that you're managing the business? Is
there sort of an infinite number of things that you guys could spend on if you wanted to? And we should expect this
sort of level going forward? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of same-day delivery or delivery speed, we have just a tremendous amount of
selection, and what I was referring to last time was I said I talked about – with a large amount of selection broadly,
that's certainly challenging to do same-day everywhere. It's certainly a challenge from an economic standpoint.
That being said, we – if you look back over the past several years, we have done – added a lot of capacity. We're
getting – we have large FCs that are closer and closer to customers. That has helped improve our delivery speed to
customers. And programs like Prime specifically has helped us get closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed
standpoint.
So what I would expect moving forward would be more of the same. We're going to continue to improve the customer
experience in every possible way we can which includes getting closer to customers from a shipping standpoint and we
feel good about that. And again, you've seen improvements in the past year and in the past several years, and New York
is one of those examples where you're seeing certainly shipments going in the same day in cases.

And our final question will come from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. Just thinking about this investment cycle – it's been like two years and a quarter and yet
revenues decelerating a little bit and free cash flow and margin trends continue to be kind of down year-over-year. Can
you just talk about what you're seeing on returns on the investments you've been making over the last two years? And
as far as like, return on invested capital, is the profile of your returns changing over time as you think about history?
And then when can we start kind of seeing returns on this as far as revenues improving or kind of some of the financial
ratios starting to turn? Can you give us any thoughts on how you're starting to think about that?
And then just a financial question. U.S. revenues for other were up 63% and then international was plus 15% for other
and I think the difference is AWS. Is there any other big differences between the two geographies that we should think
about? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of return on invested capital, beyond the total numbers there's not any specifics
that I can point to right now. But what I can tell you is, in terms of our profile, if you think about the parts of our
business, the retail business, I feel very good. We have a lot of experience in terms of getting great returns for share
owners. We feel it's something that we have, again a lot of experience in, as we've added new categories in particular
geographies. Oftentimes we've already launched those in other geographies, so we're able to learn from the experiences
we've had to date. So we feel good about those.
We have a great portion of our businesses and our media businesses converting to digital so we've talked a lot about
that, and feel very good about the opportunity that we have there both in terms of making great devices as well as
integrating content into those devices. So we feel good about that business and it's growing very fast.
In terms of our Web Services business, that's a – if you start with the core operation of that business. We've been in that
part of the business serving Amazon the customer since inception. We've added a lot of new services that have helped
both Amazon internally as well as external customers. We like the characteristics of the potential ROIC potential of
those – of that business as well.

Our third party business continues to grow on our consumer business dramatically and we like the ROIC potential of
those. We're investing in a lot of new geographies. A few in the last couple of years, and on top of that China. China is
– you should think about that one as more of a long-term opportunity, something that we've been investing in for
several years. You shouldn't be expecting high returns on invested capital in the short run, in that geography, but very
exciting from a long-term perspective. Italy and Spain, we're in investment mode in those geographies. But, again,
those are more in line with some of the other geographies we're in, in terms of time line for returns and feel very good
about those. So, hopefully that gives you some picture of a little bit of the landscape and how we're thinking about
ROICs.
