Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we will review our first half 2014 performance within
the context of the goals we set for this year and the opportunities we see going forward.
We see the next 18 months as important given that by January 2016 the ACA will largely be in place and we will be
entering an election cycle that will set the stage for shaping the next phases of health reform.
For decades, the trend has been for greater private sector engagement in meeting ever-increasing national healthcare
needs. These include the foundation of what is today Medicare Advantage, the launch of Medicare Part D drug
benefits, the formation of accountable care organizations, the steady migration of Medicaid to managed care, the
expansion of benefit coverage to the uninsured under ACA exchanges and expanded Medicaid programs, and the
improvements to the healthcare.gov and many state-based exchanges.
UnitedHealth Group businesses have participated strongly in each of these developments and we remain focused on
making these efforts successful and sustainable as they continue to evolve and settle into the fabric of our national
healthcare system.
We continue to execute steadily on that change agenda and we believe an improving environment in 2016 and beyond
will support acceleration on our earnings growth rate.
This morning, we are raising our 2014 revenue outlook to $130 billion from the previous forecast of $128 billion to
$129 billion. We are strengthening our 2014 earnings projection to a tighter range of $5.50 to $5.60 per share. The
increasing earnings momentum we expect in the second half of 2014 should position us to grow both revenues and
earnings per share in 2015. Advancing our performance in this 18-month timeframe will remain challenging, but
achievable, anchored by strong Medicaid growth, steadily strengthening Medicare and international performance,
deeper entry into new, more established public exchange markets and continuing strong growth in earnings momentum
at Optum.
These elements are visible as well in second quarter results reported today. In the second quarter of 2014, UnitedHealth
Group grew revenues 7% to $32.6 billion, and earned $1.42 per share. Optum contributed nearly 30% of our
enterprise-wide operating earnings this quarter. Solid cash flows from operations of $1 billion for the quarter and $2.4
billion for the first half of the year were approximately one times net income in line with our 2013 patterns as our
strongest cash flows come in the back half of the year. We continue to project a range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion in
cash flows for full-year 2014.
Reviewing our results in more detail, starting with UnitedHealthcare, second quarter revenues grew 6% year-over-year
to $30.1 billion. The quarter featured earnings from operation of $1.8 billion, driven by a strong operating margin of
6.1%, even with the growing mix of Public and Senior sector business.
UnitedHealthcare's seen significant and accelerating growth in Medicaid. 380,000 more people in the quarter and
635,000 through the first half of the year, coming from expanded access to Medicaid in about half the states we serve,
the launch of Florida's planned Medicaid expansion and core program growth from already-established markets and
programs.

In Medicare, we grew to serve more than 400,000 more people across all products in the first half of 2014. A very solid
and balanced performance considering the market actions we needed to take last year in response to reduced Medicare
program funding for CMS.
In the core senior medical products of Medicare Advantage of Medicare supplemental benefits, we have grown the
number of seniors we serve each year for more than a decade, and this year should be no exception. There is no
question the private sector provides significant value to Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare has been and will continue to
be a growth business at UnitedHealthcare. We're privileged to serve one out of every five American seniors, today we
serve 3 million people in Medicare Advantage plans and 12 million across all product types.
We expect to deliver overall Medicare growth for years to come, driven by favorable demographic trends and our
strong local market cost and value positions, supported by deeply-integrated Optum resources in pharmacy services,
primary care delivery, house calls, data analytics, and compliance.
Our Medicare Advantage business works with senior, focused care providers under rising levels of well-designed
shared risk and performance-based payment arrangements, to deliver more effective clinical management in concert
with well-targeted and executed home businesses. From the senior's perspective, we offer market-leading access to
quality care across a broad spectrum of venues combined with the attractive benefits under strong brands with
convenient broad-based distribution.
Commercial membership continued to track with recent trends, pulling back in risk-based products as we remain
focused on pricing discipline and endeavoring to strike the right balance in protecting margin and giving back some
past growth. In self-funded products, our momentum is steadily strengthening. We are winning national account
business and retaining key customers we are privileged to serve. We're pleased to return to serve as a core benefit
option in the State of Georgia in 2015.
Customers are still announcing final decisions and our pipeline is much stronger than this time last year, we feel
positive about our January 2015 position at this early stage.
In the individual market, we plan to grow next year as we expand our offerings to as many as two dozen state
exchanges. This approach is consistent with our long-stated plan to take a prudent first-year position, and then build
and expand in 2015 and 2016, as these markets become more established.
By participating moderately this year and then watching closely and listening, we've learned about pricing, networks,
regulatory structures, distribution, and the consumers' mindset regarding public exchanges. These data points help
inform our positioning for 2015, which should be a better risk vintage for the public exchanges.
We believe public exchange markets must be sustainable on their own, so our participation will not overly rely on risk
corridors or assumptions under risk sharing provisions. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that more than 75%
of the exchange market is yet to develop, and we believe there will likely be meaningful membership activity in the
market after the initial experience of this year and as second-year pricing is presented. So we plan to grow steadily
from this point forward advancing our participation in a measured manner in public exchanges in 2015, 2016 and
beyond.
Bringing together this year's developments across these various product categories, our original forecast for U.S.
consumers served is proving fairly accurate in total, with greater incremental losses in full-risk commercial benefits,
which we discussed last quarter, offset by exceptional growth in Medicaid, which should come in well in excess of
800,000 people this year.
Turning to Brazil, Amil is seeing clear signs of steady recovery from a surge in utilization beginning in the last half of
2013 in response to aggressive new government mandated access standards. Our premium rates are improving or are
catching up to the increased levels of medical services. We are deploying capital to continue to building out Amil's
franchises in the Rio, São Paulo and northeastern Brazilian markets, which nicely benefited our membership numbers
this quarter with 110,000 net growth.

In our view, Brazil remains the most fertile market for health benefits and services outside the U.S. and we expect our
focus and efforts in this large high-potential market will reward our shareholders for years to come.
At UnitedHealthcare, we continue to project a 6% commercial medical cost trend plus or minus 50 basis points for
2014. Our medical costs remain in line with our plan and remain moderate.
The consolidated medical care ratio for the second quarter was 81.6%, 10 basis points higher than last year, despite less
reserve development and a shift in the mix of our business towards government programs, resulting in upward pressure
in the ratio year-over-year.
These factors were mostly offset by a 100 basis point reduction from the implementation of billing of the ACA fees and
taxes. Second quarter results were led by the Public and Senior sector where revenues from federal and state-based
programs continue to develop positively. Public and Senior sector earnings are running slightly favorable to our
original 2014 outlook.
We are constructively supporting innovative ways to universally improve the quality and affordability of healthcare for
consumers. In one example, we and several other healthcare companies are collaborating with the not-for-profit Health
Care Cost Institute to develop and provide free access to online healthcare transparency tools that offer consumers the
most comprehensive and accurate information about the price and quality of healthcare services, so individuals can
make more informed decisions about their health and health care.
HCCI's transparency tool will be available in January 2015 and HCCI plans to advance more free services for
consumers and other key healthcare stakeholders in the quarters and years to come.
Last fall, we took more intense focus on improving our Medicare Star's performance for Medicare Advantage. We
made changes in people, organizational alignment, business processes and funding and resource allocation, which we
believe are yielding positive results.
We project our Star performance for 2015 payment year will be better-than-expected and will steadily improve in 2016
over 2015 and even more meaningfully in 2017 and 2018, creating a steady, multi-year upward progression. Our
commitment is to maintain a baseline of no fewer than 80% of our seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans rated
four stars or higher every year.
At Optum, we are tracking to deliver record revenues and profits again this year, driven by market demand for our
broad portfolio of capabilities and solutions. Second quarter results are on plan with Optum's margins on course to
strengthen again in 2014. We expect margins will reach approximately 7% this year even as our pharmacy services
business grows at an accelerated pace. These advances are consistent with our original forecast last fall and Optum's
8% by 2016 commitment.
We remain focused on building a scalable end-to-end services platform. Healthcare system participants are beset with
more complex challenges than they have ever faced. Their needs have grown beyond the standalone product offerings
that are characteristic of this fragmented market. Optum is integrating services and capabilities to better meet and
anticipate the emerging needs of the market, whether around advanced analytics and population health, deeply
integrating pharmacy in medical management or more effectively delivering and documenting clinical care.
These markets each represent multi-billion-dollar growth opportunities, unified for customers in a flexible, modern,
comprehensive, and fully-scaled services platform. The growth in revenue, backlog and pipeline and the increasing
number of larger, deeper, and more-sophisticated Optum relationships demonstrates steady progress in converting these
opportunities into revenues and provides visibility in near-term growth and an indication of strong, long-term future we
see for this business.
At the same time, Optum continues to have opportunities to improve its basic operating performance. We continue to
better integrate and align internally, focusing on delivering higher value products and services with greater efficiency,
better leveraging resources and competencies and information analytics, technology and clinical care, and improving
our cost structure and operational efficiency. These efforts are equally important to achieving our long-term earnings
goals.

Continued investment remains central to Optum's long-term growth. The quarter carried $80 million in investment
costs, as we deepen capabilities in areas such as consumer engagement tools and distribution services, next generation
analytics that uniquely combined administrative and clinical data at scale, next generation medical care review and
compliance analytics and services, and international versions of products and services that have become established
here in the U.S.
We will be investing startup costs in major Optum360 relationships and Optum technology outsourcing arrangements
and moving forward on services focused to the needs of targeted international markets. These investments continue
throughout the year, but should have less noticeable effects on results in the fourth quarter of 2014, as Optum's overall
growth and performance accelerates and we benefit from the impact of the more seasonal businesses.
In the second quarter, Optum's revenues grew 28% to $11.7 billion. Earnings from operations grew 23% year-over-year
to $728 million. Operating margin declined slightly to 6.2%, due to the planned investments just discussed and the
exceptional growth of the OptumRx business. OptumRx again led this quarter's performance. Revenues grew 42%;
earnings from operations doubled, while operating margins expanded a full percentage point to 3.6%. We processed
more than 150 million adjusted scripts this quarter, up 30% year-over-year. Our cost to fill a mail-order script
decreased 30% over the past year and we expect to drive increased consumer value through higher volumes of
mail-order business.
We have exceeded our goal of 1 million new consumers served from business awards across a spectrum of customers
in 2014 and have some early awards in hand for 2015 with a good prospect pipeline. This growth is additive to the
natural organic growth led by the in-sourcing of UnitedHealthcare's pharmacy business over the past two years.
OptumInsight's growth was again led by strong performance in government-sponsored services. OptumInsight is
providing services to five separate state exchanges in addition to its continuing role with the federal exchange. By the
mid-year point, computer-assisted coding offerings from our Optum360 revenue management organization were
installed in more than 50 customers, who operate more than 220 facilities, and the pipeline continues to grow.
On the downside, the regulatory pullback in hospital clinical compliance services continues and has pressured revenues
and earnings for that product offering. And at OptumHealth, we are continuing to build out our local care delivery
organization. Today our physicians and clinical professionals touch 2 million consumers with high levels of clinical
quality through our local clinics, which are prominent leaders in their market.
All in, Optum delivered an exceptional second quarter and first half with improved earnings and capital returns
compared to a very strong prior year. We expect Optum's earnings to accelerate in the second half of 2014, especially
in the fourth quarter, as they have in the past years, driven by strong revenue growth, achieving performance incentives
from customers, the accumulating benefits of operational efficiencies and structural cost efforts, and favorable seasonal
patterns at OptumInsight and OptumHealth. Optum remains on pace to contribute roughly one-third of UnitedHealth
Group's 2014 cash flows from operations, all while investing in future growth of its business.
To summarize, the first half of the year was strong with revenues growing by $3.5 billion or 6% year-over-year. First
half earnings of $2.52 per share position us positively for the full-year growth, with the strong second-half growth
performance from Optum and seasonal strength in UnitedHealthcare second half operating margins expected to help
accelerate our earnings and bring us to a strong close.
We see 2014 revenues at about $130 billion and net earnings in the range of $5.50 to $5.60 per share, with cash flows
from operations in a range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion. We are intensely focused on continuing to execute evermore
sharply on the details and fundamentals in every aspect of our businesses and in everything we do for the people we
serve.
We will provide a full view of our 2015 expectations at our annual Investors Conference in New York City on
Tuesday, December 2. So thank you for your time this morning and we will now take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Justin Lake of JPMorgan.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Thanks, good morning. Questions on medical cost trends, I know you indicated trends in line
overall, but given the recent data points out there I was hoping you might have some color to share in terms of real-time
Rx trends, hospital discharge planners etcetera. And then just a quick follow-up on your Medicare Advantage
comments in the prepared remarks, is it reasonable to expect you're in a position to grow membership here for 2015?
Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yes, so Dan Schumacher, you want to comment? I don't know if we'll get into that level of
detail, but I think we can add some color.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Justin, this is Dan. With respect to the cost, obviously in the quarter we
were pleased with our medical cost performance and as Steve mentioned, our underlying cost trends remained very
well controlled. We continue to make improvements in our medical cost management and a lot of that honestly is in
strong partnership with Optum, whether it be payment integrity, local care delivery, our partnership with OptumRx, and
so forth. And so as Steve mentioned, on the full year we still expect our cost trend to be in the 6% plus or minus 50
basis points range, we'd likely expect that to be closer to the lower end of the range. With regard to what's happening in
the quarter and our early data, nothing would suggest that we're seeing any kind of surge, so as we look at daily
hospital census data, as we look at prior authorization for outpatient and inpatient procedures, pharmacy fulfillment, all
of those things wouldn't point to any sort of surge in the quarter.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Gail or Steve Nelson, you want to talk about MA?
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Sure, good morning, Justin, this is Gail Boudreaux. In terms of your question on Medicare
Advantage, first of all, we really like our position around Medicare and feel that the work that we've done over the past
year has put us in a good position. So overall we are looking to grow and we'll provide you a lot more detail obviously
at our investor conference, but we do feel that the work around network product positioning value has put us in a good
place and feel positive about Medicare.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Do you want to add anything?
<A - Steven Nelson>: No, I think you said it well.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Okay, next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Yes, hi, good morning. I was hoping maybe you could talk about what you are seeing in
the pricing environment as an update from last quarter in the traditional commercial risk business and maybe that
relative to the 280,000 commercial risk lives that lapsed during the quarter?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning, Matt. It's Jeff Alter. Really nothing has changed in that pricing environment that we
discussed in the first quarter. The pressure remains mainly in New York and a couple other small group markets. I'd
just remind you that a part of that or a large part of that 280,000 member loss was related to our individual footprint.
We had mentioned in our investor conference that we were going to lose individual business throughout the year
because of our pullback in a lot of markets. And I think we are beginning to see changes and some good momentum in
other parts of our business other than those few pressured markets, and as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks,
really encouraged by the national account season, and then our win back of the State of Georgia and a couple other
larger public sector accounts so...

<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Has your view changed at all with respect to you're looking at 2015 being a quiet year for
contract changes?
<A - John S. Penshorn>: Matt, could you clarify what type of contract? I'm not following. It's John.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Well, I think that the question earlier in the year had been, for 2015 are you going to see
significant carrier switching particularly for the large accounts that renew on a calendar year basis? And I think you had
said, you thought it was going to be relatively quiet year for that. Now with your backlog increasing, has that view
changed at all?
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: This is Gail. In terms of your question, a couple of things, Steve mentioned in the
comments and I think Jeff reiterated, in the large-case market, we're still positive about what we're seeing in the
marketplace and the momentum we had. You saw we just won State of Georgia back, which I think is another positive.
In terms of in-year switching, we're very pleased with the cases that we locked in as part of last year and that provides
us a nice long-term run rate. So overall, we see there're some positives emerging dynamics, but again, we're early into
the cycle right now, so I don't want to comment fully on next year, but I think it's pretty consistent with what we've said
on the last call.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Peter Costa>: Hi guys. Your guidance for commercial loss ratio back in December was 79.2% plus or minus 50
bps. You note on the first quarter call that the pressure from Sovaldi and the New York pricing market was pressuring
the overall consolidated loss ratio towards the higher end of the 80.5% to plus or minus 50 bps. But never, I think
specifically noted what the impact was on the commercial loss ratio. Can you, so it's hard to tell right now whether the
commercial loss ratio is trending about where you expected it to be or is it a little worse than you expected it to be,
especially since it looks like there were some gains from favorable revenue adjustments on the government business.
Can you talk to sort of the puts and takes relative to the Medicare business – Medicaid business, and the commercial
loss ratio relative to your expectations?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So I'll have Dan answer that, but that's quite a question. So we'll kind of do it in a
summarized form.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Thanks Peter. So obviously in the first quarter we talked about our – both our consolidated
loss ratio and the implication underneath that, our commercial loss ratio would be near the higher end of the range that
we had provided at Investor Day. And as we look at the second quarter, in light of that revised expectation, we see
things tracking well. So our commercial business is tracking in line with those expectations coming out of the first
quarter and we're doing a little bit better in the government business on the care ratio.
<Q - Peter Costa>: And can you specifically say what the revenue impacts were from the favorable true ups in the
revenue development in the government business?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: I'm not going to share specifically the revenue developments, but just to provide a little bit
more color on the revenue developments, they're not something that – they're not uncommon for us, particularly in the
second quarter. And so what you are seeing is a combination of finalization of our 2013 Medicare revenue that has
pulled through to our 2014 estimates. And we also have true ups in our state-based program, so we have got true ups
obviously related to the industry fee as we get that, as well as normal retroactive rate adjustments, so all of those things
are represented inside there.
<Q - Peter Costa>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So just getting back on Medicare Advantage, I appreciate the
comment that Gail made around you guys will look to grow in 2015 and you like your positioning. So is that indicative,
I guess, it's sort of a two-parter, so I'll admit I'm [ph] hitting (27:54) up front. Are you done with the provider
renegotiations in network work? And then I guess more importantly, is Medicare Advantage a growth business from an
operating earnings perspective next year?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Steve Nelson, why don't you respond to that?
<A - Steven Nelson>: Okay. Sure. First, in terms of just overall positioning, our Medicare Advantage business, as Gail
mentioned, we really like the performance so far. We've made a flat investment in Stars in our clinical programs and
network. And these things have to work together in order for this to continue to be a growth business for us. And so in
terms of network specifically, we've done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of shaping our network and concentrating
our members with high quality and highly-engaged providers. That work will continue, but I would say in kind of a
more of a different format. We're going to be working more with provider's insider network to further concentrate that
membership and expand our ACO footprint and engage more heavily in capitation and other types of value-based
contracting within our existing network as opposed to actually reducing the number of providers. So, it's a little bit of a
shift towards working with providers already in our network, but working closely with our network and shaping it and
focusing it in this way is going to be part of an ongoing process and really important to as we continue to improve our
Stars, our clinical performance and our member satisfaction.
I think we're very positive on this. We have taken the steps that were necessary and they were the most disruptive and I
think at this point forward we're now positioning this business in a way for good, long-term sustainable growth, stock
compliance, and so while we continue to be working on this, we're very positive about where this space will go.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: So to recap, you're not making – so all the heavy lifting and the big changes around
providers and things that really impact the member, that's kind of behind us the rest of it's going to be kind of behind
the scenes more capitation, et cetera so that's what gives you comfort on the member side, but is it also fair to say that,
okay, from that perspective it sounds like you're getting a more efficient network and that earnings growth should be –
and you sort of reset margins over the last couple of years. It's more conceivable to see earnings contributions from that
segment as well?
<A - Steven Nelson>: So, I think you're fine on all those levels. I do think that we have to be attentive to Medicare
Advantage funding levels because that has been a pressure point and so forth. But in terms of the things that would be
disruptive to the business, Steve, I think those have run their course.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yes, I think you summarized it well. And we think the earnings range for government
business we've talked about for us between 3% and 5% and we're in that range this year and will continue to be in that
range. That's our view. I'm obviously not giving specific guidance for next year, but more to come, but that's how we
think about it, really great performance and excited about the competitive positioning looking forward.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Perfect, thank you.

Our next question comes from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities.
<Q - Sarah James>: Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some color on utilization levels of the newly insured
and it'll be really helpful if you could break that out to the newly insured on the Medicaid side so would work, or
expansion members versus the commercial side, the exchange members that were previously uninsured?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We will and then keep in mind we have a very low profile in exchange, but Gail and team,
you want to respond?
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Sure, good morning, Sarah. Steve, first let me reiterate what Steve said around public
exchange membership. We had a very modest footprint there, so I wouldn't draw any conclusions from our early
experience in that sector. On the Medicaid side, as you've seen, we've gotten tremendous growth. We're really pleased
with it. We did expect to see increases in utilization and we also got higher rate cells for that and it's tracking very
much in line with the expectations we had. So overall, I think very much in line and we're again extremely pleased by
the growth that we're seeing, not just across expansion but new state wins, as well as expansion of our current existing
membership footprint.
<Q - Sarah James>: Got it. And can you just clarify, I think you guys mentioned you're not relying on 3R's for 2015,
does that also mean your guidance assumes no receivables for 2014 for the 3R's?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sarah, it's Dan. On the 3R's, we have nothing on corridors and risk adjustment and we have a
very modest reinsurance that assume recovery that's immaterial.
<Q - Sarah James>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.
<Q - Kevin Fischbeck>: Yes, thanks. One quick clarification before I get into my main question. Did you say Steve
that you expected 2015 stars to be better than expected? I didn't quite understand that comment.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yes. We are expecting to track progress in 2015 and build progress from that in 2016,
2017, 2018. So we are committed and see a forward progress in stars.
<Q - Kevin Fischbeck>: But you don't mean what we know of already, you don't mean the 2014 data for 2015, you
mean 2015 for 2016 to be better than expected?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yes, Gail, you want to respond to it?
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Yeah. Well we – when the stars were published last year you had a sense of where our
membership was. We've made significant improvements in our group business, which will help improve our actual
2015 results.
<Q - Kevin Fischbeck>: Okay, all right. So it's a membership growth within the high star rating plans.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: That's right.
<Q - Kevin Fischbeck>: Okay. Okay. And then just, the main question is, on the exchanges, you mentioned that your
year one was about kind of watching and learning and then year two is more about growth. Can you just give us a sense
of some of the things that you learned, because you're making a really big move? You're going to do a couple dozen
states. You've really moved in. I mean what's given you the comfort and the confidence that this business, since you are
still relatively new around the claims development that it is going to be stable into next year and that this is the year to
move in rather than waiting another year to get even more information?

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I'll also have the – well this will be a team response. But again, this was consistent
with how we positioned this right from the beginning that we would observe the first year for the most part and then
endeavor to participate and we will see how we ultimately did participate as we go through the balance of this year and
get ready for the next year selling season, but the size of the – in response to the exchange, the expected growth in it
and so forth plays into that thinking. And recognition this is going to be an established sector in the healthcare benefits
marketplace and that we have to choose to participate at some point in time and kind of want to make sure we don't go
in too late. So I think we're thinking this is about the right time.
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: The only – this is Gail Boudreaux again, the only thing I would add is, getting back to
Steve's comments, we've always felt it was a good long-term market. What we've been able to observe and learn over
the course of the market is we know the existing pricing, we know the network constructs, we know the consumer
behavior on what they pick in these different markets, we have a better understanding of the regulatory structure and
the distribution pattern. So from those factors, we're looking at the market as an opportunity and again more than 75%
of that market is going to emerge and we feel that those markets that we're looking at now are much more established.
So that's the background around our thinking on exchanges. But again, we've always felt that it was part of our strategy
and plan that this is a good long-term market.
<Q - Kevin Fischbeck>: Great. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Andrew Schenker>: Good morning. I was wondering if the operating costs, they were actually meaningfully
below our expectations and down year-over-year I think once you accounted for the charitable donation, despite the
pressures from the industry fee. Can you perhaps discuss the level of investments in the quarter and what other savings
may have drove down that ratio? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dave?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Sure. Yeah. We are quite pleased, Andy, with the operating cost ratio for the quarter.
Obviously it's got a lot of pressure because of the implementation, the insurers' fee. And the second quarter which of
course wasn't in place last year. But where we're are really seeing the advances in our contributions from our PBM
business, which is benefiting not only from scale efficiencies, but also significant productivity advances both around
just regular process management as well as the implementation of technology. So Dirk and the team have done an
excellent job there. Otherwise, as we indicated in the investor conference, we were pursuing somewhere around 75
basis points to 80 basis points of annual productivity improvements, and we in fact achieved those in this quarter. So
really what you're seeing is this raw productivity and scale advantages coming through our businesses as we projected.
In terms of investments, I think we outlined those in the script with respect to the types of things that Optum is
investing in. It's really investing in growth and I think that growth is really manifesting in terms of its pipeline
expansion year-over-year. Done a very nice job there and as indicated those investments are about $80 million in the
quarter. On top of that, as you might suspect, there are significant investments going in across the business to respond
to the implementation of the ACA provisions as well as growth more broadly, or preparing for growth more broadly
both in the exchange marketplace as well as in Medicaid.

<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to come back to hepatitis C.
Obviously, it hasn't been talked about nearly as much on this call but can you give us a sense for how the expenditures
sort of tracked from Q1 to Q2, and sort of the pace of expenditures you're expecting in the back half of the year given
the potential for some new drugs coming to market?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Dan?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Good morning, Chris. Our Q2 spend for hepatitis C was in line with our revised expectations
coming out of the first quarter. I will tell you that in the first quarter, our new patient volume peaked in all are benefits
businesses, and I think we've got strong controls over the appropriate use. So as we think about the cost related to
hepatitis C and its treatment, we have that accounted for and accommodated within our full-year trend outlook as well
as in our care ratio guidance.
<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: Okay. And then if I could, how are discussions going with the state Medicaid partners with
regard to the drug? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Austin?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Sure, this is Austin Pittman. Well, first of all again, the cost of the program we expect it to
be fully reimbursed, we're very pleased and making strong progress in our discussions with our state partners in
securing that reimbursement.

Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of UBS.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Thanks. Maybe two part thing on Optum. First of all, I know you talked around the investment
spending and said it was $80 million in the second quarter, but that by the fourth quarter should have less impact. Is
that because that $80 million run rate goes down, or is that because of the leverage of spending? And then more
broadly, just on OptumRx. You mentioned some positives related to the 2015 selling season, I wondered if you could
expand more on is Optum out there actively pursuing business across the board. Do you have your sort of integrative
model fully in place now where you can talk to people about total cost? Or is that still something that'll come in future
selling seasons?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: [ph] We'll (41:14) be anxious to answer that question. Larry, you want to take?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: A.J., it's Larry Renfro. I'll start with the question on the planned investments and then I'll ask
Dirk to pick up the PBM question in terms of the sales. So when we began the year and had our plan put together, we
expected to spend about $200 million in what I will call planned investments for the future, a very, very similar model
to what we've actually done with the PBM. And I think you know over the past few years we spent some dollars in
order to get the platforms up to speed and we're kind of using that same playbook, so for the year, it's $200 million. We
have spent year-to-date about $140 million, so obviously we're overweight in the first half of the year and you'll start to
see that go down as we head into the fourth quarter. So – and financial targets and so forth, this was all planned, there's
nothing out of the ordinary, so we're online – or in line with everything that we're doing. So again, let me say that
again, it's $140 million year-to-date that was planned year-to-date out of the total of $200 million.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Okay.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dirk.
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Yeah, so A.J., thanks. A couple of things, first, Steve mentioned that we had a nice year in
2014 with respect to our growth. As we look at our pipeline for 2015, our pipeline is up double digits compared to the
same time last year. Not a ton of business is changing hands, but if you look at what we've closed this year versus the

we go in and we talk to prospects, it's all about bringing together the medical, the lab, the pharmacy data, and try to
optimize outcomes and lower costs. We think we also have a good service offering, and I think we do a pretty good job

Our next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Thanks. Just wondering given the broader entry into the public exchanges in 2015, what your
strategy is for surmounting the auto enrollment policy that would seem to give an advantage to incumbents. Is it more
that you just expect so much more growth in the exchange market that that's not really an issue? And just wondering
whether you think that that policy is a bit anticompetitive for new market entrants or that it just benefits the market in
terms of reducing likely the overall amount of churn in the market?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning, Scott, it's Jeff Alter. On the first part, there is going to be a scale as, Steve, mentioned
earlier, still a large amount of the population that we expect to be in those exchanges, we'll call it at the end of the
cycle, and we expect to take a large part of that new business. But just on the existing population, there's a lot of
leverage around the subsidy and price changes, so as competitors change prices it does tend to move the subsidy dollars
around pretty strongly. So we believe there will also be shopping even though people don't have to shop. I think just the
natural consumer play of an exchanges going to cause a shopping experience and we feel we'll get some part of that
membership shift as it goes along. We're obviously not going to comment on the anticompetitive part of anything so...
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: And just as you see some of the initial rate filings now coming out for the exchanges in the
individual market, how would you say that those are coming out so far relative to your expectations in terms of the
competitor filings?
<A - Jeff Alter>: I think they're within our range of expectations. You are seeing competitors who might have relied a
little bit on the 3R protection and as that protection goes away they have to adjust their pricing and we are seeing that.
So nothing that we've seen to date surprises us or changes the approach that we've taken with her own pricing. We're
very comfortable with our pricing. And just keep in mind that that pricing is driven not only by our forward view of
cost, but also as we've mentioned, we've observed the marketplace in 2014. We are bringing different product to market
in some of these exchanges than we would have traditionally brought, some more HMO; much tighter alignment with
Optum and some of their programs to help us manage the diseases and the health of those members and creating in
some cases a different dynamic with the network.

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yes, Larry, you want to start?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. Christine, I'm going to hand this off to Bill Miller, who is the executive that runs the
OptumInsight [indiscernible] (46:43) Optum360 sets and we will not specifically talk about our customers. Maybe I
can frame kind of some of the size of our potential accounts and where we're headed and I'll let Bill then talk
specifically about Optum360. I think you know that when we set priorities for 2014, we talked about really one of the
priorities going after and I think Steve mentioned it earlier, sort of larger, deeper relationships, and more complex
relationships and last year, we aligned with an organization on the West Coast to do revenue cycle management and
we're starting to build that. So I'm going to give you four areas that I would say that will kind of depict what we're
trying to do and the size of that.
Our external backlog right now is up 20% and that's up to $7.5 billion. Our pipeline is up 122% and continuing to
grow. I will say that the government business is in that and if you look at that as a standalone, that's about $1 billion of
probably about $6.6 billion in that total pipeline. If you looked at our top 25 accounts and the revenues that we've had
over the past, well, since 2011, our revenues are up 2.5 times and our accounts that had values of over $100 million are
also up 20% year-over-year in a number of accounts we have. Obviously Optum360, we have a strategy that we are not
going to get into detail about because it is an extremely competitive strategy that we are deploying.
That's why the amount of investment that we are actually putting-in in the first quarter and will start to see in the fourth
quarter – I should say the first half of the year and you will start to see the benefit of that in the fourth quarter as we
talked a few minutes ago with A.J. You will also be able to note that we are over-weighted in our spend during the first
six months of the year. So let me let Bill talk specifically about Optum360 and some of the things going on there.
<A - Bill Miller>: Yeah. Christine, good question and thank you. So as far as painting that picture, I think the picture is
it's a very big market, a fragmented market, and we see ourselves, I think, very well positioned to drive a lot of
efficiencies for health systems that are struggling with that fragmentation. We also bring, I think, a very strong attitude
not only from a technology standpoint, which we have served the market with for years, but all the services and
processes needed to take out cost and operate a revenue cycle with far more efficiency that's going to be required in an
environment where hospitals are continued pressured on their margins.
And I think the other thing that we keep top of mind in terms of that vision of the future is we feel uniquely positioned
to help drive out the friction between payers and providers. And we also do understand that in the future the role of the
consumer and the patient experience associated with their care, their billing, is something that's very critical and I think
is part of the mission of Optum360. And the investments associated with that are, I think being able to strengthen our
technology portfolio along with on-boarding our largest clients, and as Larry said, these relationships are growing in
size and we really like the trajectory and the backlog that we built and the pipeline growth we have seen particularly
over the last, I'd say, seven eight months.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: John? Do you want to...
<A - John S. Penshorn>: No. I think [indiscernible] (50:44) Christine you talked about so that – obviously you talked
about the scope of those investment that's clearly incumbent in the $200 million that Larry's been talking about for full
year.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Right. And a lot of it is basically implementation on a much more comprehensive revenue
cycle, population health analytics paradigm to change the dynamics in large systems.

<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the MLR point. Can you maybe talk about
seasonality in the business and sort of your thoughts there with sort of the continuation of – and high penetration of
high deductible plans, whether there's a potential that sort of magnifies the cost picture I guess in the second half of the
year? And then along those lines, MLR guidance I guess is still close to that 81% level, you did 82% in the first half,
obviously that implies 80% in the second half. Is that kind of a still a fair way to think about it? Thanks.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Hi, Ralph, this is Dan Schumacher. On the seasonality-related high deductible, I mean
we continue to make inroads in high deductible offerings. I mean it's an attractive offering within our portfolio. I
wouldn't say that there's any dramatic shift. I think the normal seasonal progression is what you should expect with
regard to commercial and how deductibles play out. With regard to the consolidated loss ratio, our full-year guidance
was 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis points and we suggested that that could be the near the high end of the range and I
think that's exactly how you should think about it.

Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink. Your line is open.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to get some color on
the outlook for the small group market in 2015. Now that there's proof-of-concept for public exchanges might your
competitors and you be more incentived to price down because you will still make a margin higher than potentially
public exchange margin [indiscernible] (52:56) their offerings of benefits to their workers?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I'm not sure we got clear on the last part of your question. You want to reframe that, Ana?
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Yeah. So, I guess what I'm trying to understand is, I'm hearing generally the buzz is that small
group employers are more likely to dump or reduce their offerings for 2015. So would that potentially put more
pressure on the pricing as well as the size of the market for 2015?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Okay. Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning Ana. It's Jeff Alter. We continue to believe that the employer dumping will be
somewhat moderated. It was moderate this year. We're not sure next year is any year that would be much different than
this year as these exchanges establish and I would say as you're seeing some of the pricing normalize, which might take
another year or so for that to happen. Just on the sort of pricing interplay between the two markets, they are different
markets. And we look at them around the population that we are serving in each one of those when we think about
pricing. So right now in our thinking there is an arbitrage between those two marketplaces. They're different, there are
consumers served in those marketplaces. And our pricing for small group is really predicated on what we believe that
risk looks like, what that membership looks like and then our responses to that risk. And that would be the same for the
exchanges as well.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: And this would include your self-insured competition as well? Is this propensity for self-insured
continuing at it has been historically.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Ana, I don't know what kind of phone you're on, but it was not coming through clearly at
all. So you want to try that one more time?

<Q - Tom A. Carroll>: Hey, good morning. So a question on your Medicaid performance. You're showing very strong
results. So I wonder if you could remind us just kind of what you expect into next year. I mean do you expect outsized
enrollment growth to continue into 2015? And additionally, where do you expect pre-tax margins in this business to
settle out, given a larger population driven by the Affordable Care Act, as well as new groups like dual eligibles?
Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Austin?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Sure. Thanks for the question. We're excited about the growth as well. It's been an
outstanding year as Steve highlighted in his opening comments. We now expect that growth to be over 800,000 on the
year. And I will tell you the thing that is great about it is if you look at this quarter's growth, the 380,000 that we grew
this year, it's really evenly split between expansion populations as well as what I call core growth. So that's winning
procurement, executing those procurements, implementing new programs within states that we're already in that state
and have a relationship, good strong organic growth. I think as far as the prospects for continued growth, we feel very
strong about this business, particularly if you look at the combined strength of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, our ability
to really address state partners' needs to deliver value in complex populations. So I think the outlook is strong.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And margins?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: As we've talked about before, we expect this business to continue to perform at 3% to 5%
range.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. And that the scale will pull you to the stronger side of that?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Absolutely
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: But that's no different than where we've been for the last couple of years.
<Q - Tom A. Carroll>: Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please.

The next question comes from David Windley of Jefferies.
<Q - David Windley>: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to get a little more framing around your SG&A
expectations as the year progresses. There's been a fair amount of conversation about investments. Your first half is

well below, I think, your full-year guidance. I guess I'm trying to get at, could we expect that the full-year will trend
toward the lower end of that based on where you are looking so far this year? Or are there discrete investments that are
layering on there in a fairly significant way to drive that up? Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. I guess a couple of things come to mind is that we are clearly focused on continuing
to be focused and efficient in this. And then there's the selling season in the second half of the year is a big factor.
Dave?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: David, it's Dave Wichmann again. As Steve outlined, it's both the selling season and
the back half of the year, which affects Q3 and the preparatory work in advance of OEP and then Q4 is the actual
payment of commissions and otherwise associated with that business. But also the significant work we do to prepare
for January 1 and the incremental volumes from growth in our business. So we always see the back half of any given
year
as having a higher operating cost ratio than the first half of the year. With respect to where we're at on overall guidance,
we said it would be 16.7% plus or minus 30 basis points. We're still squarely within that range for the full year.
<Q - David Windley>: Are there – perhaps around exchange, your significant increase in participation and exchange
that you anticipate for 2015, is that in line with what you would have anticipated when you gave guidance originally?
Or is there perhaps more investment to prepare for that for 2015?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: David, it is in line with what we had planned all along. So we always anticipated a
more modest participation this year and then ramping in the 2015, 2016 time period. And that's exactly how this is
playing out.
<Q - David Windley>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next please.

The next question comes from Brian Wright of Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Brian Michael Wright>: Thanks. Good morning. Could you tell us how much of the sequential revenue growth
at Optum this quarter was internal versus – OptumRx was internal versus external?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: You know, I don't know if we can. But obviously just given the size of
UnitedHealthcare that it's a – that's meaningful in the in-sourcing. It's a meaningful element of it.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dirk, maybe you could comment on generally on your balance for the year. I think you
may have that available?
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Well, I guess what I would say is, we continue to have a pretty good year as we sit and look at
it. Some of the efficiencies that Dave pointed out, we'll continue to leverage those as well as additional purchasing
efficiencies that we have specifically in the generic area should continue to make us expand margins a little bit as we
proceed through the year.
<Q - Brian Michael Wright>: And then if I could, I'm sorry?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Please. Go ahead.
<Q - Brian Michael Wright>: Yes, no. If I could just follow up on just kind of EPS progression. Does the
commentary about the acceleration in Optum in the fourth quarter and then the getting the Medicare Advantage true
ups in the second quarter versus third quarter, does that change the back half seasonality versus more recent years like
last year?

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: No. I think in general the pattern is consistent year-to-year. And so the relative kind of
40-60 in terms of the first half to the second half and then the fourth quarter should be stronger than the third. So that
pattern holds up.
<Q - Brian Michael Wright>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question.

The next question comes from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.
<Q - Carl R. McDonald>: Great. Thank you. Six months ago you talked about growing earnings in 2015 but not at the
long-term target rate. The earnings growth you talked about this morning is that still the right context to think about?
And related to that if there's any major shift in the moving pieces that you've highlighted previously in terms of another
year of reform implementation of Medicare rate cuts that would also be interesting.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. I'm not sure I got the second half of that. But no, we wouldn't expect that our
targeted growth rate, which is kind of 13% to 16% that 2015 would be in that zone just given the continued
adjustments. But then moving 2016, 2017 beyond, we clearly are focused on getting back to that zone and see a path to
that. But the timing in terms of stepping through 2015, 2016, that's what we're navigating right now.
<Q - Carl R. McDonald>: I'm sorry. The second half of the question was just if there was any change to some of the
bigger moving pieces you talked about previously for 2015 in terms Medicare rate cuts as well as another year of
reform implementation being the biggest headwinds to getting to that long-term growth rate?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I wouldn't say there are new headwinds, which is a very positive thing to be, and I actually
think that we are making real progress on the, I think to this quarter's performance and the kind of our outlook we are
making steady progress on the challenges that are in the marketplace for us and everyone else. So I don't think there are
any dynamic elements of that. But if I go back to the things that I parse through in thinking about that, I would say the
Medicaid performance and growth is a nice upside. I think our positioning on Medicare, I see us having made a nice
adjustment here and are focused on making sure that we are attuned to kind of the next era of Medicare Advantage and
Medicare product progression. We see a nice potential in terms of the international marketplace and good work that has
been done in EMEA. We're going to keep a very positive posture towards the exchange marketplace and see that in the
kind of same margin range as our, let's say, our Medicaid business at a 3% to 5% range.
When you look at Optum and its potential and the opportunity for the collaborative care local care delivery businesses,
the potential of the major relationships, kind of anchoring relationships for OptumInsight and 360 and the ability to
kind of diversify and take a new, maybe broader, more progressive approach on the PBM that really does start to tie in
medical costs, diagnostic testing, specialty pharmacy and so forth. I think that provides a lot of potential to work with
kind of against the challenges that the ACA set in front of all of us and that we are working through right now. So that's
what gives us a view that we have a lot of work to do but there is a lot to work with.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question.

So with that, we appreciate very much your attention today UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare
delivered a I think a very solid second quarter growing both revenues and earnings per share. We remain focused on
consistent fundamental execution, innovation, service. We believe we are positively positioned for the full-year and a
strong close in 2014 as well as continuing growth in 2015 and beyond. So thank you and we will see you next quarter.
