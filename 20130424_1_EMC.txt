Anthony T. Takazawa
Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2013. Today
we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO Joe Tucci, and David Goulden, EMC President and COO. To kick things
off, David will comment on our results and how these tie with the execution of our strategy and business operations. He
will also discuss our outlook for the year 2013. Joe will then spend some time discussing his view of what is happening
in the economy IT, EMC's vision and strategy, and how EMC is helping customers navigate the massive transformation
happening in IT regarding cloud, Big Data, and trusted IT. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to
take your questions.
Today we are providing you with our projected financial model for 2013. This model lays out all of the key
assumptions and discrete financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find
this model helpful in understanding our assumptions in context and in ensuring that these expectations are correctly
incorporated into your models. This model is available as background in today's slides, available for download in the
Investor Relations section of EMC.com.

David I. Goulden
Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported a solid start to
2013, with revenue growth of 6% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 5%. While customer caution continued in the first
quarter of this year, we executed well on our mission to capture the opportunities presented by cloud, Big Data, and
trusted IT. Our growth outlook for the year of 8% and 9% for revenue and EPS is unchanged, and our Q1 results of 6%
and 5% are consistent with the seasonal progression for revenue and EPS we discussed in January. We firmly believe
our results attest that our strategy is the right one.
As demands on IT have intensified with the rise of trends towards mobile, social, and Big Data, customers are finding
greater efficiency, agility, and choice from cloud infrastructures. Whether private, public, or hybrid, cloud turns IT into
a service that can be utilized on demand. This vision has guided our strategy since 2009, and we continue to hone our
broad, best-of-breed portfolio to enable IT-as-a-Service, both on premises and off. Adhering to this vision while also
continuing to address customers' broadly varied needs as they transition to next-generation infrastructures has enabled
us to continue to gain market share. In Q1, we believe these share gains continued, with growth across all our segments
and all our geos, including solid 10% growth from our BRIC + 13 markets.
Today's dynamic environment requires IT to be able to respond to constant change, which is why flexibility and choice
are such high priorities with customers. Businesses require IT resources that can scale on demand, can handle a variety
of workloads, and can be trusted at all times. Choice is a key value proposition of what EMC offers. The federated
structure we introduced last month is instrumental to this. At the information infrastructure layer, EMC's information
storage, information protection, information security, and information intelligence businesses are built to facilitate the
agility, efficiency, and choice that makes cloud so appealing. Leading technology developed with a horizontal, open
approach ensures choice into the future. Our best-of-breed product strategy ties integration with VMware, and support
for Microsoft and OpenStack give customers choice.
At the Virtual Infrastructure layer, VMware continues to lead the market with a vision to rapidly simplify IT by
expanding capabilities beyond server virtualization to software-defined data center, hybrid cloud, and end user
experience. VMware's commitment to enabling choice is unparalleled. At the application layer, Pivotal has the
foundation and leadership in place to offer best-in-class options for new application development leveraging big and
fast data so customers can leverage a next-generation platform to develop and deploy new apps without having to
choose or commit to any one specific infrastructure. This innovative framework leaves each business free to focus on
its own mission while leveraging the advantages of one common strategic vision and creating the greatest opportunity
for customer choice.
While Pivotal was not officially formed until April 1, we wanted to give you a view of our revenue performance for Q1
along the lines of this new federated approach. With that in mind, throughout the rest of my prepared remarks, I'll be
talking about the various businesses as if Pivotal was in place in Q1 and the associated revenues were not included in
the reported EMC and VMware businesses. We're including a slide in our presentation today showing the as-if revenue
associated with the three elements of the federation, just to give you an idea of how they're distributed.
With that said, let's look at each of the businesses in turn, starting with EMC Information Infrastructure, comprising
storage, security, and information intelligence. The biggest piece within our Information Infrastructure business,
storage, grew 3% in Q1. Information growth continues, but the nature of it is changing. Different types of data grow at

different rates, with large-scale file and object-based data sets growing faster than traditional transaction data sets. The
types of workload that leverage this data are even more varied. Some workloads need very high performance; others
need high capacity. Certain workloads need very high service levels; others need very little. What this means is
different storage is needed for different workloads. From a deployment perspective, some of these workloads work well
in public clouds; some are better off in private clouds. We offer storage infrastructure for this broad variety of
workloads, for both private clouds and public clouds alike.
Both private clouds and public clouds represent growth opportunities for us. We expect far more business workloads to
run in private clouds than in public clouds in 2016 and therefore represent the larger opportunity. A recent report
estimated that IT spending on private cloud will grow at a 58% annual rate from 2012 to 2016. However, supporting
workloads running in public clouds is also a very fast-growing opportunity, and the service provider vertical continues
to be the fastest-growing vertical for our storage business. These variations within storage are important to consider,
and our new view of the storage business is designed so you can better track how each of the business lines within
storage is progressing. This format captures the varied nature of growth across our broad portfolio, with the
fastest-growing solutions captured in our emerging storage line and the more measured growth demonstrated by our
unified and backup business and our high-end business.
Year-on-year growth of our high-end storage business accelerated from the second half of last year to 10% in Q1. This
was driven by growth in the 10K and the 40K, which were over 60% of VMAX systems in the quarter. With
unmatched scalability for the largest and most mission-critical environments on the 40K, and its expanding reach
down-market with the 10K, our VMAX customer base is growing. What all our VMAX customers have in common is
a desire for the very best solution for performance, consolidation, and automation in demanding virtual data center
environments, many of which are evolving into private clouds or are powering public clouds.
We're helping to drive the transition to cloud with the Q1 launch of the Cloud Edition. This self-service enterprise-class
storage delivery platform accelerates time to value for providers of public cloud services, as well as for enterprise and
midmarket IT offering private cloud services. In Q1, we had customers buying Cloud Edition for both private and
public cloud deployments.
Our unified and backup recovery revenue declined slightly in Q1 in what has been a trough environment for this
segment of the market, although there were areas of strength. Our portfolio in this space is strong, thanks to ongoing
innovations that keep our offerings at the forefront of the market. In our unified portfolio, this means innovations to
optimize storage for cloud environments, support levels of choice, and building trust. The VNX family scored in each
of these areas in Q1, as one of the first united solutions in the market with critical integration capabilities with both
VMware and with Microsoft's latest releases, Windows Server 2012 and Hyper-V 3.0. We also enhanced security on
the VNXe, with the addition of data arrest encryption and FIPS 140 security certification. One of the most distinct
advantages of VNX is our FAST software, which enables tiering over Flash and SAS drives to deliver improvements in
efficiency and performance and is a key reason why customers select VNX over other unified storage arrays.
We also had excellent traction with VSPEX in the quarter. Our backup and recovery systems business continues to
grow nicely in Q1, as it plays an important part in enabling trusted IT. Data domain systems continue to be the gold
standard in the purpose-built backup appliance space, with a market share of over 60%. It is also a key component to
the rest of our backup portfolio and important to the portfolio effect with Data Domain plus Avamar and our network
wins in Q1 coming from just about every geo and every sector, including a Scandinavian university, an Asian telecom,
and an American tax authority. Additionally, revenue growth of our data protection software suite was very good. We
have an exciting roadmap in place for both unified storage and our backup recovery products and are very encouraged
by the potential for this part of our business in the second half of 2013.
Our emerging storage businesses grew 24% in Q1. It is an exciting time for new storage technologies right now, and
we're committed to building our market leadership position in each of the areas where we play. Our scale-out file
offering, Isilon, continues to do well, gaining ground in enterprise markets for use cases such as large-scale home
directories and archives, while continuing to maintain its leadership position in traditional strongholds in verticals like
media and life sciences. Isilon's expansion in big-name enterprise accounts has been aided by the significant uptake of

the latest generation of Isilon's scale-out operating system, OneFS 7.0, introduced last year. OneFS 7.0, which many of
you may recall was codenamed "Mavericks," has seen the fastest adoption in Isilon's history, with over 400 customers
completing installations thus far. Our scale-out NAS architecture is exceptionally well suited for extremely large-scale
big data sets, and Isilon continues to win in web companies as well.
Complementing Isilon is our scale-out object platform Atmos. The ability to store, archive, and access globally
distributed unstructured content at scale that Atmos offers is a key capability for private, public, and hybrid cloud
infrastructures, and customers are taking advantage of these capabilities on Atmos, as evidenced by the continued
sequential growth exhibited by Atmos off a strong Q4.
Our Xtrem Flash family was launched in March. The Xtrem Flash family includes XtremSF PCie cards, which
accelerate performance on the server and include MLC as well as SLC; XtremSW suite, which includes our XtremSW
Cache products; XtremSW Cache, used with XtremSF cards, accelerates application performance and leverages the
data services of a storage array to protect data; and our XtremIO all-Flash storage array, which delivers unparalleled
performance without sacrificing the rich data services customers value in their storage infrastructures.
Having different flavors of Flash allows customers to leverage the latency and throughput advantages regardless of the
workload. With server-side Flash, customers love the performance gains Flash brings, and they're pleased to see an
alternative solution on the market with the addition of our XtremSF DAS solution. The customers participating in the
XtremIO Directed Availability program are very excited about this transformational technology. XtremIO is unmatched
in its ability to be able to deliver sub-millisecond response times without compromising rich data service functionality,
including in-line deduplication, thin provisioning, data protection, and rival snaps and being able to scale out on a
linear basis. We're excited about our new Flash products contributing to the growth of our emerging storage business as
we progress through 2013.
We have not yet launched our software-defined storage solutions, but we expect them to become an increasingly
important part of our emerging storage business. Software-defined storage is part of a bigger focus across the federation
on building out the software-defined data center and involves the same approach, abstracting the control plane and the
data plane, pooling resources, and automating management of these resources through policies. The result is simplified,
scalable storage, and expanded customer choice that can fully leverage existing storage investments.
We have built on a decade of knowledge about storage to architect EMC's software-defined storage to solve the critical
problems created by complex and varied storage architectures. The goal is to provide a policy-driven storage
infrastructure capable of running all applications and managing that storage infrastructure in a consistent way.
Designed for massive scale, geo-distribution, multiple data centers across the world, compatible with heterogeneous
arrays and dovetailing with VMware's software-defined data center strategy and also supporting OpenStack and
Hyper-V, we expect our software-defined storage to be very well received by customers, both SPs and enterprises.
Our professional services and our other storage revenue declined 3% year on year. These are lower-margin businesses.
Storage professional services, which includes implementation and consulting services, benefited in Q1 from continued
data center consolidations and rationalizations globally. We're also experiencing good demand for our newly launched
continuous availability consulting service. Other storage revenue consists of third-party and other less-strategic
products within storage. When you look across our storage business, we are pleased with growth at the high end and
encouraged by the potential in our unified and backup recovery businesses and the roadmaps that will boost growth
here, and are very excited about continued growth in our emerging products and the upcoming launch of EMC's
software-defined storage solutions.
We're also encouraged by the adoption of new technologies like Flash across our entire storage portfolio. Flash
capacity in Q1 grew 60% year on year, with most of this in our hybrid storage arrays. With the right storage for the
workload, and an effective strategy to transition these workloads to the right cloud, we expect the storage share gains
that we've achieved over the past several years to continue into the foreseeable future.
Like storage, the right approach to security is also key to successful implementation of cloud, and RSA is delivering,
with revenue up 12% in Q1 over last year's first quarter, with both identity and data protection and security

management and compliance up year on year. By leveraging Big Data to create intelligence-driven security, and
integrate the capabilities across the portfolio to provide truly contextual solutions, RSA is creating powerful and
effective offerings. RSA's new security analytics suite and Authentication Manager 8.0 are being very well received by
customers after their launch in Q1, as they utilize a Big Data approach to tackle today's dynamic threat environment. It
is this intensifying threat environment that keeps security at the top of the IT priority list, as evidenced by record
attendance of about 25,000 at the RSA conference in February, record registrations for the Archer User Group
Conference, and registrations for upcoming security events in Europe and Singapore that have exceeded available
capacity. Clearly a tremendously positive response on both our strategy and our offerings.
Our information intelligence business performed well in Q1 and returned to year-on-year growth. IIG was up 7% in Q1,
as more modular, vertical-specific solutions for workflow processing resonate with customers. While IIG was helped
by a couple of large enterprise deals in Q1, we are pleased to note faster growth from several of our newer initiatives.
[indiscernible] (18:38) performance was ahead of plan, and we saw good traction for our new life sciences, healthcare,
and energy solutions.
VMware got off to a solid start for the year with revenue growth of 13%. VMware's areas of focus – software-defined
data center, hybrid cloud, and end-user computing – all showed very good growth. Customers are opting in for broader
features beyond server virtualization, with over 30% of VMware's license bookings coming from vCloud, management
and automation, and end-user computing. VMware is a highly strategic and key component of our business, a market
leader, and aggressively pursuing software-defined data center, hybrid cloud, and end-user computing.
On April 1, we formally created Pivotal. We're excited about its mission to build a platform that will accommodate
cloud and big and fast data applications, all requirements for the next generation of IT, which involves millions of aps
and billions of users. Revenues from products and services transferred to Pivotal on April 1 was almost $70 million for
the quarter, and we expect 2013 revenue to be approximately $300 million. This morning, Pivotal announced that GE
will become a significant strategic investor.
The same flexibility that characterizes our product portfolio exists in our go-to-market model, as customers want the
choice of flexibility to move to cloud in different ways. As a result, our go-to-market spans our world-class direct sales
force, deep and innovative partnerships with our reseller community, and new approaches such as VCE. Our channel
program continues to improve quarter after quarter, and Q1 was no exception. Over 50% of our storage revenue goes
through the channel, and this revenue continues to grow at a faster rate than storage overall. Our VSPEX program has
been very helpful here, and in Q1, we were able to bring the total number of VSPEXs sold to just under 2,200. This
rapid ramp in less than 12 months is remarkable and clearly much faster than any other reference architecture on the
market.
VCE also performed well in the quarter, and last year's investment to build our presence in new geographies has begun
to pay off. VCE has established significant customer presence in targeted international markets and provided entry into
numerous competitive strongholds, with nearly half of Vblock demand in Q1 coming from new accounts. VCE
continues to experience good success with surge providers, as many of the larger, established service providers are
using Vblocks for multi-tenancy and for a variety of IT-as-a-Service offerings.
Our cloud service provider partner program continues to expand, with revenue growth from this program of over 40%
from Q1 of last year, much faster than storage overall. This growth is stemming from the addition of new partners, as
well as from additional purchases from existing customers. Partners are using elements of our entire portfolio to stand
up a number of value-added, on-demand offerings, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, and
Software-as-a-Service. Their service catalogs continue to expand, with the number of unique offerings provided by
these partners up 16% from Q4.
Our solid results in a continued cautious spending environment speak to the soundness of our strategy and our
execution. Consolidated revenue grew 6% in Q1, with the strongest growth in Latin America, up 27%, followed by
growth in North America of 8%. APJ grew 4%, and EMEA was up 1%. Revenue mix shifts to higher-margin
businesses, including VMware, continued to benefit gross margin, which improved slightly on a consolidated basis.
Operating expenses grew slightly faster than revenue on a consolidated basis, due to the greater mix of OpEx from

VMware. Net-net, operating margin was 23.2%, in line with last year's first quarter. Below-the-line items all came in
pretty much where we anticipated, and non-GAAP EPS in Q1 was up 5% to $0.39.
Free cash flow was $1.4 billion in Q1, approximately flat with last year, and $592 million higher than non-GAAP net
income in the quarter. Contributing to this was continued strong growth in deferred revenue of 19% to $8.1 billion at
quarter end. While cash taxes paid impacted year-on-year free cash flow growth in Q1, we still expect to achieve 2013
free cash flow growth of 10%. We finished Q1 with $12 million in cash and investments. $5.9 billion of this was in the
U.S. Excluding VMware, EMC has $4.3 billion of U.S. cash and investments. Our cash deployment in Q1 balanced
return to shareholders with investments for the longer term. We spent about $200 million on acquisitions and spent
approximately $300 million on buybacks of EMC shares in Q1. We're on track to repurchase $1 billion worth of EMC
shares by year-end.
As we look to the rest of the year, we'll continue to focus on our strengths and take advantages of the many
opportunities before us. Our approach, which values efficiency, agility, and choice across the three layers of IT –
information infrastructure, virtual infrastructure, and next-generation applications – is differentiated . In fact, as
customers evaluate their investments more carefully in the context of how they'll use next-generation IT to their
advantage, we think our vision incorporating all three layers is especially relevant. Customers trust us help them take
full advantage of the many business benefits offered by cloud, Big Data, and trusted IT.
We are reaffirming our expectation for 2013, namely that we expect EMC revenue will grow 8% to $23.5 billion.
Non-GAAP EPS for the full year will grow faster than revenue to $1.85 per share. We also expect to grow free cash
flow by 10% to $5.5 billion. As we said last quarter, there are a few other assumptions that should be considered, and
these assumptions have not changed from what we said in January. First, we have modeled our revenue to follow a
seasonally normal percentage of total for each quarter of the year. Second, because 2012 did not follow a seasonally
normal progression, first-half revenue growth in 2013 will be lower than the full-year average of 8%, and second-half
revenue growth will be higher than 8%. Third, this revenue growth pattern means that while we will show operating
and EPS leverage for the year in 2013, the leverage benefits will come in the second half of the year. This means, of
course, that we won't see leverage in the first half of the year. We continue to expect operating leverage in 2013 to
come from both gross margin and operating expenses.
As we look out further into the future, we're confident that the industry trends driving our success in 2013 will continue
and our strategy will continue to resonate. With continued steady execution, we expect to achieve the longer-term
growth potential we laid out for you last month: over $30 billion in revenue in 2016, which represents a compound
annual growth rate of 9% from 2012, and a non-GAAP EPS CAGR of 10%-plus. This longer-term view underscores
our belief that we're well positioned to continue to grow much faster than the IT marketplace, to continue to produce
leverage in the business, and continue to innovate and evolve to capitalize on the opportunities created by cloud, Big
Data, and trust.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?
Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, David. I would like to begin by adding my welcome and thanks to everyone attending today's conference
call. It's good to have you with us. Overall, I was pleased with our results and our execution in Q1, as the quarter came
in in line with our expectations.
That said, we found the bookings flow this quarter to be quite back-end loaded. In other words, we experienced a high
level of hardware and software bookings in March, especially in the last two weeks. The very good news is that our
supply chain, our factories, and our distribution teams executed flawlessly. The main reason for the late bookings this
quarter is that customers are still being very cautious with their IT spending. For sure, most orders are subject to greater
scrutiny, and many enterprises are now requiring a higher level of executive sign-off before they give final approval.
Undoubtedly, this caution is being fueled by the continuing tide of political and economic uncertainties. Additionally,
when you look at the organic growth profile of other IT companies, I believe you will understand why we believe we

executed well. I would like to publicly thank the approximately 59,000 talented people from EMC and VMware for
their hard work and their dedication.
To add more color about the quarter, on a geographic basis, we experienced growth in North America, Latin America,
and in Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, that was greater than our overall rate of 6%. In EMEA, we experienced very
modest growth, while in Japan we declined slightly on a constant-currency basis. From a vertical market point of view,
we saw strength and high growth from our service providers. We saw good growth in the financial services and
healthcare industries, and we experienced weakness in public sector and U.S. federal. Looking forward, we still believe
that overall IT spending in 2013 will grow in a 3% range over last year.
Against this backdrop, we continue to expect to grow our top line 8% this year, reduce some leverage, and grow our
non-GAAP EPS by 9% and our free cash flow by 10%. What underpins our confidence in 2013 is our winning strategy
of cloud, Big Data, and trusted IT. The way we have divided this strategy and executional focus between VMware,
EMCII, and Pivotal, a unique business model that focuses each entity on a set of clearly distinct, yet related missions,
giving each of them the charter to build the products, go-to-market capabilities, and the ecosystem necessary to win.
Also what gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our goals in 2013 is the expectation of a strong roadmap and
product cycle, especially in the second half of this year. And most importantly, what underpins our confidence is the
fact that our customers are not only giving us permission to play in our chosen markets; they are downright
encouraging us to play and play hard.
I would like to thank the hundreds of you that attended our Strategic Forum on March 13, either in person in New York
City or virtually via our webcast. Your feedback was both very positive and indeed very helpful. As we stated that day,
we understand and appreciate the vast opportunities that the trusted cloud, Big Data, mobile, and the social IT world of
the future will avail to us. Additionally, we believe that there is still plenty of growth ahead in today's IT environments,
environment which power almost all enterprises today. And make no mistake about it, we are well placed to introduce
disruptive technology into today's world, and we will help our customers in their journey to private and hybrid cloud
computing and to new and big fast data technologies that will dramatically change every industry and business.
Also at our March Strategic Forum, we used the opportunity to formally unveil the newest member of the EMC family,
Pivotal, under the leadership of CEO Paul Maritz. Pivotal, for those of you that might have missed it, will focus on Big
Data and predictive analytics, fast data, as pervasive telemetry and the Internet of things becomes reality, and a
platform for enabling a new generation of applications that can exploit big and fast data, interact with legacy, and do so
in a cloud independent way, offering choice and portability across the world's leading private and public clouds, from
the likes of VMware, Amazon, and OpenStack.
And today, I am extremely pleased to announce that GE will become a strategic investor in and 10% owner of Pivotal.
GE, from the very top down, is laser-focused on using third platform IT to transform its winning businesses and
business models. The EMC family is thrilled that GE chose to participate in Pivotal. GE has our deep appreciation,
thanks, and commitment. To get more details, please join Paul Maritz from Pivotal and Bill Rue from GE for their
webcast today at 1 p.m. Eastern Time, 10 a.m. Pacific Time. The call and details are in Pivotal's press release that was
issued this morning.
Again, thank you very much for being with us today. I would now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A
portion of today's call. Tony?

Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Your line is
open.
<Q - Shebly Seyrafi>: Yeah, thank you very much. So question for you, Joe. It looks like the storage market has
slowed down since the second quarter of 2012, and I'm wondering – you talk about political and other factors. I'm
wondering what are your thoughts about the movement to the cloud slowing down storage spending secularly, and what
do you think needs to happen to accelerate growth in storage?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Shebly, remember, we – David, I think, both today, a little bit, and in depth at the Strategic
Forum we had in February, talked about application workloads. And depending on where those application workloads
are, depending on when they were written, how they were written, really dictates what kind of storage it needs and
where it could run. So the truth of the matter is – I don't really – the cloud today has been a net benefit to us so far, for I
don't know how many quarters in a row; I haven't been counting. But at least the last four, we've said that our
highest-growth business has been to service providers. So we're selling a lot of business.
First of all, cloud is not only public cloud, it's private cloud. We're leading the journey to the private cloud, and that is
using it. And of course when you put – let's put it Platform II type of applications into a cloud, you need storage which
has a rich set of services, which favors us. Our market share within storage is going up. I do believe you're seeing a
tremendous amount of shadow IT go to the public clouds, and that's both good and bad. Good in that new things are
tried. Bad in that I think we lose – the enterprises lose some control of the information. But over time, this will be, I
think, net good, and we're going to play in both the private and public side, and it's all about what we're doing in terms
of adopting HGFS with native, our scale-out in NAS, our object storage Atmos, our software-defined storage – stay
tuned, we're going to do a lot of that at VMworld in a couple of weeks – our Flash program. So we have a great
portfolio that plays both with the cloud and traditional data centers. And, remember, the cloud is both private and
public. So we do not see this as a negative trend for us.
<Q - Shebly Seyrafi>: Okay.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: – please?

Our next question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great, thanks, guys. Obviously when you look at consolidated EMC gross margins on a
year-over-year basis, the trajectory is nice in the sense that it's improving year over year. But when you break apart
VMware as well as core EMC, it looks as though EMC actually declined from a core standpoint year over year in terms
of margins. And so I think this is obviously atypical for you guys. I was wondering if you could talk about the key
drivers of that year-over-year decline. And then is this a trend that's going to continue throughout calendar 2013? If you
can give any color there. Thank you.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I'll start out. David is fighting a little bit of a – voice problems here. But I mentioned how late
this Q1 came in. And in anticipation of that, because obviously we also said we had a late – not as late, but a late – Q4.
So that caused us to say, okay, if it's going to be late, we need to build up more inventory. In the end, when you get
orders late, you need to buy different kinds of inventory, which, when you buy inventory late in the quarter, it tends to
cost you a little bit more. We have more people and more costs in the factories. We have higher shipping costs. Also,
our fixed costs are up a bit this quarter. Our fixed costs grew faster than revenue, due to software capitalization,
amortization, warranty costs, and manufacturing overhead. So that's kind of what happened to us. We told you very
clearly – David stated it again today – that we did not expect leverage in the first half of the year. We expect good
leverage in the second half of the year, and this quarter came in very close to our expectations. And I think when you
look at it on the proverbial curve, I really think we had a good quarter.

<Q - Brian Marshall>: Thanks, Joe.
<A - David I. Goulden>: And I'll try and pick up. Unfortunately, I have very bad laryngitis this morning. So I taped
my comments last night, knowing that I couldn't speak today probably. But just to pick up where Joe left off, the
fixed-cost issues, we don't expect fixed costs to rise as much during the year. We expect our volumes in storage to
increase, so that factor's going to become less of an issue going forward. So we do expect the EMCII gross margin to
increase sequentially during the year. We expect that the consolidated company margin will be up year over year, and
that with the OpEx is what's going to drive leverage in the business in 2013.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Get better, David. Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Thank you. Thanks Brian.

Our next question comes from Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
<Q - Alex Kurtz>: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Just a following up with the earlier question about the clouds,
Joe. It seems like there's an opportunity to take Symmetrix into some of these public clouds that you're not in today. We
get a lot of questions around AWS. Why couldn't a Symmetrix be stripped down and reconfigured in a format that
could allow a provider like AWS to provide a Tier 1, high-end kind of service? Have you guys thought about that as a
strategic direction for Symmetrix longer term?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Well, one of the things David alluded to – I don't think he alluded to it; he actually said it in
his remarks – was the Cloud Edition of Symmetrix coming out. And some of the attributes that you mentioned will be
front and center. So obviously, it's a very – Symmetrix has the richest set, by far, of functionality and software
capability, and it's doing well in the private side of the cloud, doing okay in the public side of the cloud. And we think
there's lot more we can do with that platform. So stay tuned.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks. Next question, please?

Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, Joe. This is definitely for you, not for David.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: David said thank you; you just couldn't hear him.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Joe, I wanted to ask you about the strategy of having a company of companies. And that is
to say you've announced that Pivotal is taking some money from GE and will ultimately look to go public. VMware is a
public company. And I'm confused on why you're doing that. Originally VMware, I think, was done, at least partially,
to give currency for employee retention purposes, but in effect, you're adding to G&A, and you're also deleveraging a
consolidated global sales force. So I'm unclear about the strategy about why you have these assets. As a matter of fact, I
could make an argument the spinoff of VMware really hasn't added value to the EMC shareholders and indeed today is
detracting from the upside potential of EMC given the volatility in that stock. So maybe you could just speak to why
you continue to head down this path. Thank you.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Well, I think the major reason is – you nailed it. When you see an opportunity as massive as
big and fast data, the opportunity to build cloud – you have to be free to build an ecosystem that not only includes EMC
and VMware, in that case, but others.

<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: And I think you'll see that come to fruition. There's a lot of – I don't want to go further than
I'm going, but there's a lot of interest in what we're doing in Pivotal.
On the other side, having a family stack also gives us a lot of clout and credibility. Also, when you get a company like
Pivotal and you're going to make a huge bet on it, having the EMC, let's say, Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on
it, and our balance sheet, and working together with our sales force and our capabilities, gives customers a lot of
confidence to try something newer, if you will. So I think there's great benefits. But the biggest benefit is that you have
this ability to attract an incredible talent pool under the Pivotal stock, if you will, having a leader like Paul Maritz,
having a company with the prestige and the thrust they have for the industrial Internet as a core owner and partner in
this. I think it's a great way to go.
You're right, there's some times when VMware was adding a lot of value; now it's got a little more volatility. But I
think when this all plays out and the software-defined data center and the hybrid cloud and what we're doing in storage,
and what we're doing in security, and what's happening on big and fast data and the platform for the next – I mean,
these are assets that most companies would kill for. So when you look at our strategic play and you look at the
opportunities that the third platform – the third great platform of IT's going to present, I think that's what we're aligning
for. Over time, there'll be a lot of different ways we can get – you can look to monetize things, but I think we're on a
great track right now, because we're building up a great set of assets and tremendous leadership capability. And people
are excited as heck in any of those companies, including EMC, including Pivotal, including VMware.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: All right. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew J. Nowinski>: Okay. Good morning. Nice quarter. Just had a question on the VNX, the midrange. I
know you're calling it unified now. But it's been over two years since you've launched the VNX, which I believe is near
the end of your typical refresh life cycle. So regarding the 2% year-over-year decline, given all the chatter in the
channel regarding a pending refresh, did that have any impact on your unified revenue this quarter? And then could you
also talk about the impact to your sales cycles when you introduce new platforms? Thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Well, I think we've done everything but say it, so I'll probably say more than I'm supposed to
say. And David's cringing here because he wishes he could talk. But you're exactly right. There is – and I'm not going
to give the date, but in the second half of the year, okay, there is a considerable refresh and cycle, really positive
product cycle, for the VNX. And I think that's what product cycles are all about. They wouldn't be cycles if that didn't
happen. So near of the end of a life, things do slow down in anticipation of a new one. So are we experiencing some of
that now? Of course we are.

broadening portfolio, more workload-specific needs, you've got more competition – the complexity just seems to be

more important in this industry landscape? Thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I think it's not an or. You asked a question as an or. I think it's an and. I think the companies
that will fare best – which is certainly what we are committed to do, focused to do, are doing – is to have a strong direct
sales force that works in harmony, that is comp neutral, to work with a growing and vibrant channel, and you do both.
And you're right about one point: You have to worry about your channel, because it's in effect an extension of your
selling capability, and you have to worry about their profitability. You have to worry about, are they trained properly?
Are they providing value to customers? So all those things go into the mix, but we are incredibly committed. I couldn't
be more committed to channels than I am, and I think the channels and direct sales forces, if you have your comp plans
right – and we spend a lot of time on our comp plans – are best friends.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Have you changed the way, though, that you've incentivized the channel at all, kind of given
all the changes that's been happening?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Yes, we continually change. Is there a specific you're after?
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Well, I'm just wondering if, I guess, there's more pressure, related to those gross margins,
whether there's more pressure because of the incentivization of the channel.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I don't think that's it. Because we find if we can get a channel to invest, invest in inside sales,
invest around knowing our technology, invest in field sales and support, the margins through the channel are quite
good, because when you look at operating margins, you get a maybe a little bit less gross margin, but, again, you don't
have as much selling cost because our sales force says, "Hey, I have a trusted partner. I'll turn it over to them, and I'll
go do something else." And when you get a channel that can do the lifting, it turns out positive and is actually net-net
margin neutral.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Perfect, thank you.

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to touch on the Flash solution that you guys
launched. I believe it's supposed to go [ph] GEA (45:56) sometime late Q2, early Q3. But broadly, when you look at
the intake so far that you've had for XIO and the PCIAS II solutions, can you talk about, are these products helping you
gain new customer relationships or new channel relationships? Or is it more about selling these solutions to existing
customers so they don't look at other vendors? And then longer term, how big do you see Flash becoming as a percent
of EMC's storage portfolio?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: David says he wants to try again. Go ahead.
<A - David I. Goulden>: I will try, and if I can't get it out, then I'll give it over to you.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Now I feel bad.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Sorry. But thanks for asking me a question. So the XIO is in what we're calling right now
Directed Availability, which means it's available for sale to select customers where we have a cab-defined plan that we
both agreed to. I'd say that's a combination of existing and new. Obviously, though, a lot of customers are looking at
Flash generally. And we want to make we've got our Flash solutions in front of our existing customers so they can
really look at their strengths, because we do believe that XIO is something that's very different and very new.
In terms of becoming a major piece of revenue, the Flash products we introduced are all brand new; they're not really
contributing anything now. They're going to start contributing to the emerging product segment in the second half, and
I think you'll see them contributing to the storage business more broadly in 2014.

Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I have a question, just going back to the gross margin. I guess one of the things
– it's the first time that we've seen the information storage side's gross margin decline year on year in some time, and I
take your point, Joe, that there was some -
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Kulbinder, you're really fading. Can – ?
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay, can you hear me now?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Better. Thank you.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay. Yes, so my question is on the information gross margins. I take the point that the
quarter was late and that there's some costs that also came in as a result impacting that, but it is the first time they're
down year on year. I'm just wondering, Joe, is there anything that you've seen really change in the competitive
environment over the last few months? And specifically, are you seeing any impact from not necessarily the NetApps
of the world, but from the newer startups being more aggressive? I think Nimble, for example, are seeing some really
good traction in the market. And they often talk about targeting both yourselves and NetApp. I'm wondering, has
anything changed there that could be explaining this as well, or is it simply just the cost basis you mentioned?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: There's a tremendous amount of noise out there, but I can tell you point blank, most of our
competition's coming from our traditional sources, whether it be one of the server vendors that also sells storage,
whether it be from the traditional, the established storage players, whether it be Hitachi or NetApp, et cetera. There's a
lot of noise being made by these new startup crews, but in reality, that's just not who we're facing. You keep coming
back to is how much of the business is, like, an Amazon stealing?
I still think it's basically customers being cautious. The customers are for sure sweating their assets more. That's a term
we use. They're keeping them longer. We see that in terms of how long we – we have a very good genealogy on all our
products. We know how long they've been out in every customer, what drives are in them, what et cetera, et cetera. For
sure customers are keeping their assets longer. For sure the industry – right? – us leading the industry is giving them
better tools: compression, deduplication, better ways to do copies or snaps or clones, more efficient thin provisioning.
And I could go on and on – and then software-defined storage will give them, again, another set of capabilities. So I
really think that's more of what you're seeing, is the caution and customers, to use our term, sweating their assets
longer, and the fact that we have given the industry – and others, our industry has given tremendous benefits in terms of
utilization tools and productivity tools within storage. And I think that's what you're seeing right now, a combination of
those two things.

terms of pushing those products?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Well, obviously, a lot of anticipation, both us and the market, on XtremIO. And, of course,
again, that's a second-half product. As David said, it's in directed distribution now. I can tell you that customers that
have the beta versions are not only high on it, they are wild about it. This does more than advertised, so we expect that
to be a significant hit.
Obviously there are certain applications – this is very application specific – where customers with the application like
high-frequency trading, where they want the storage right on a PCI slot in the server. And of course we're getting
growth there. But I don't think the cycles for selling are materially different. They might be longer for a new product
because customers want to kick the tires longer, but in terms of we're not anticipating any change in selling cycles.
We're looking forward to these new lines of products hitting, let's call it maturity, so that they'll be readily adopted,
whether it be in the server-side Flash or storage-side Flash.

Our next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on the free cash flow, as you think about the usage going
forward – and this kind of relates to Keith Bachman's question a little bit. But how do you think about, strategically,
buybacks and distributing that between EMC, VMware, and then you're going to have Pivotal out there as well?
Because, clearly, some analysts would rather see you buying back more EMC stock as opposed to other entities. So I'm
just curious how you strategize that use of free cash flow amongst the entities you're building out and just in general.
Thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Okay, let me make just a couple comments on that. But I'll make them very hard and very
succinct. I want to assure you that this area is in a very active discussion with our board. Very active. I also assure you
we are committed to increasing – I'll repeat the word increasing – our return of capital to our shareholders going

Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Great. Thank you very much. We'll look forward to that $60 billion buyback anytime
soon. Could you talk about the cloud a bit more, specifically Storage-as-a-Service? In private cloud, you're doing
managed services. Could you explain kind of what that is, how that works, if at some point in the future you might
actually have to take assets on your balance sheet, or you'll just basically kind of run storage for your enterprise
customers? And then in the cloud, obviously, you're having some success selling to service providers, but some of the
ones we talk to do indicate that having branded EMC-type equipment's a little less important than it used to be. Some
of them are investing in their own storage technologies potentially. And I'm not talking about a Google or an Amazon,
but more the Terremarks of the world. What are you running into in that part of the world as well?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Okay. Kind of related, but two different questions. On the managed storage services side, our
method is we let the customer make the call. So, in other words, we will basically go into a customer's site and manage
their estate on their premise that they bought. Number two, we'll basically say we'll manage it on your site; it'll be our
asset. There are cases where we have bought back some equipment and put that in the equation also. There are places
where the customer wants to manage you but they want us right by their side. So the customer basically can dial it in

anyplace there. The difference is we don't take it offsite. We leave it on their site or one of their service provider sites.
There are service providers we also have run that service for.
And then, of course, what you're talking about is there are service providers that run dual strategies, several of them,
where they'll offer enterprise storage, and maybe to compete with an Amazon on their higher end elastic cloud and
elastic storage services, or whatever they – I forgot what they call it. But they have the higher-end services. And then
they'll build more of their own or use our Atmos, right – we see both of those happen – to compete more with Amazon
S3. So all those things are happening, Steve. And we basically, as part of what we're doing with software-defined
storage, as part of what we're doing with Atmos, as part of what we're doing with scale-out Isilon, are very focused on
convincing a lot of the service providers – and we've had some pretty good success – that with our expertise, we can do
that for them or with them very economically and very efficiently, and they can use their firepower in other areas.

we have to have quite a bit of acceleration in the second half. If you could talk a little bit more about maybe specifics
and also maybe throw in some geographic color – maybe does Europe get better as well? Because I noticed that was
pretty slow in the quarter. Thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Yeah, Ben. First – and I love you, Ben – I got to take a little exception. 6% growth, I think if
you look on a curve, is hardly a pause. But I understand your point. We have to accelerate in the second half of the
year.
As far as your comment on Europe, I don't think anybody is smart enough to call what Europe might or might not do.
So certainly I'd say we're not counting on it getting a whole lot worse, but we're not counting on it getting a whole lot
better either. It'll be what it'll be. I hope it gets better. What we're really – really counting on is very much a product
cycle – we know good things happen when we put good products out. We will delay products rather than put anything
that's not ready for prime time. So we have a very good handle on this second half map, and we think it's gone.
And, remember, when you think about last year, we grew 11% – this is from memory – we grew – but David's feigning
that he can't talk, so he wants me to do all the work, see if I still know this stuff. We grew 11% in Q1. We grew 10% in
Q2 last year. We grew 6%, and then 8%. And so, obviously, the compares in the second half are easier because we're
comparing to an 11% and a 10%. We got to compare to a 6% and 8%. So that helps you, too. So it's a combination of
that, the product cycle, and every day the team gets more confident, and I'm really pleased with our progress. So thanks
for asking that, Ben.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yeah, thanks, Joe. And thanks for saying you love me, too. I need it on a day like – it's a tough
tape. Thanks.

Well, let me just do the little close here, and Tony is giving me the signal. Or am I supposed to say – Tony, you're
supposed to ask me to close?

Why don't you -
Joseph M. Tucci
I've been doing so much talking today. I will just keep doing it.
Anthony T. Takazawa
Do you have anything else you want to say, Joe?
Joseph M. Tucci
But any rate, I thank all of you for being with us. David is not putting us on. He really – right after he taped yesterday,
he could hardly talk, and he does a great job, and I'm just thrilled to have him as partner.
But in summary, we truly believe that our cloud, our Big Data, and trusted IT strategies are really well placed. And
more importantly, they're being well received by our customers and our partners. I think we beat this over the head too
many times, but we're very excited about our 2013 product roadmap, albeit mostly that roadmap does fall into the
second half of the year. So we're particularly excited about the second half of the year.
I'm just proud and privileged to work with a great team. I believe we have momentum, and we are excited about our
prospects to grow and take share in 2013 and beyond. And hopefully many of you will join us either virtually or in
person at EMC World, which is in Las Vegas on May 6 to 9. And, again, thank you very much for being with us. We
really appreciate your interest in EMC. Have a good day.
