Today's presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most
comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement, which is available on AIG's website, www.aig.com.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert H. Benmosche
Thank you very much, Liz, and good morning, everybody. As I shared in May of 2011 with all of you that, I said the
AIG crisis was over as we re-IPO the company. As we look at the fourth quarter of 2012, we're just about to close the
door completely on all of the issues that AIG faced during this period of time.
You saw during the quarter, on our strategic activities and I'm on page three of the presentation. We sold the remaining
shares of AIA for $6.5 billion. We entered into an agreement to sell approximately 90% of ILFC, that sale, by the way,
is continuing. We're now just starting down the regulatory review process, so that's on its way. We would hope that we
could close this in the second quarter of 2012 and that time, we can say the door is completely closed and everything is
behind us.
We also are building towards the future and so, we made a strategic investment in PICC. That investment, as you saw,
is performing well as an investment but it's more important in that it's strategic, it is allowing us to work with the PICC
to build a very big and strong life business in China. And of course, the Department of Treasury has now sold all of
their shares and they are completely gone.
As you look at our liquidity, we're sitting here with about $16.1 billion as a result of the AIA sale and this is on top of
very, very strong capital in all of our insurance companies. We're continuing to get strong dividend flows from our
insurance companies, which is helping us deal with our strength and especially in this measure of liquidity.
But when we talk about capital management, some of you keep asking, what we said last time is still in play today, our
highest priority is to make sure that we focus on getting high cost debt out, reducing our expenses for interest and
improving our coverage ratio. As the year progresses, we will then begin to look at things like, could we add a dividend
to the stock and also could we have some kind of a modest stock buyback, but we're going to wait until we are very,
very sure, we're in great shape, because what I've said, it's important we retain our ratings and improve those rates, if
you saw some upticks here, we want those upticks to continue.
On the AIG Property Casualty business, Peter is going to talk to you this morning. But we see continued gradual
progress in the loss ratio, the mix of business, you can see is changing. So if you look at the major business on the
commercial front, we're continuing to do well on the consumer front. And we're able to overcome the fact on direct
business we can no longer amortize that over the life of the policies. We're also getting rate in the commercial arena.
So while Sandy took a big hit of $2 billion, which I believe actually reflects the size of AIG and how we do business
and the kind of business we do. But with that kind of a hit in a quarter you saw we actually made a profit, operating
profit in the fourth quarter for the company.
Life and Retirement again continues to do well. Our variable annuity sales, which are very well designed, continue to
grow, at a time when many of our competitors feel the need to contract, because of more aggressive features on their
products versus what we're doing now. Continue to see less sales in fixed annuities, which you would expect in a lower
interest rate environment.
And in our Mortgage Guarantee business, we did have to take a reserve charge to deal with the fact that as some of the
legacy book is now aging, we see less rescission. So we made an adjustment in some of the future expected claims. But
other than that, the underlying business continues to do extremely well.
So, we're continuing to work hard to make sure that 2013 is a year where you see clearly that all the fundamental
investment and hard work in this company is coming to fruition. And you'll see us continually work towards our
aspirational goals in 2015.

What I'd like to do now, is turn it over to David. David will take you through a little bit more detail on the financials.
David?
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Bob and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, there was quite a bit of activity on the capital
management and the operating fronts this quarter. We remain committed to our aspirational goals including our $25
billion to $30 billion in capital management and 10% ROE by 2015. Debt capital management is a current priority, as
you've seen from our recent tender.
If you turn to slide four, our fourth quarter net income included a $4.4 billion loss related to the agreement to sell ILFC,
which reduced book value per share by $2.97. Book value per share excluding AOCI was $57.87, up 15.5% from 2011.
Operating results begin on slide five, and as you can see, storm Sandy meaningfully affected Property Casualty results.
Sandy losses are coming in as expected at about $2 billion. Life and Retirement delivered another strong quarter with
operating income of $1.1 billion and strong investment returns. Both Peter and Jay will comment on these results in
more detail.
The direct investment book and global capital markets benefited from positive marks in the quarter, driven largely by
tightening credit spreads. At the direct investment book, NAV came down by about $1.7 billion to $4.8 billion which is
primarily attributable to our ability to extract value and deploy it towards generating incremental parent liquidity.
Subject to our stress testing framework to ensure that the direct investment book can meet its liabilities, even under
stress scenarios will be regularly evaluated. We'll regularly evaluate the DIB [direct investment book] for further
opportunities to extract value from – for our company and our shareholders.
As a reminder, the bulk of the hedges associated with the assets and liabilities of the direct investment book reside
within global capital markets. Over time, we expect to realize additional value from the DIB and its hedges in excess of
what is required to service the liabilities, even under stress.
However, it's important to note that approximately 60% of the direct investment book's debt is maturing in the next five
years. So, it's safe to assume that for the near term, a significant portion of the DIB's maturing assets and their
corresponding hedges will go towards satisfying these upcoming liability maturities.
Interest expense came in as expected, corporate expenses, which were slightly elevated in the quarter, included the
impact of costs incurred from continuing infrastructure build-out, our branding and advertising expenditures and some
modest restructuring related costs.
The effective operating tax rate decreased during the quarter to just under 23% due to a impact from discrete items, as
well as some permanent items for the quarter. Looking to 2013, we continue to expect our operating tax rate to be
roughly in the 30% range. As you may recall, we will not be paying any U.S. corporate income taxes for some time,
given our NOLs.
Slide six shows the current status of our deferred tax assets. Despite losses from Storm Sandy, we will – on a tax return
basis, we will utilize about $4.4 billion of the gross NOLs in 2012 aided by the non-core asset monetizations. We also
utilized a little over $4 billion of our gross capital-loss carry-forwards.
Additional capital-loss carry forwards may be realized in the future if and when other prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies are identified.
Our capital position remains solid and on slide 7, you can see our debt levels reflect the $1.8 billion of senior debt
issuances earlier in the year and our shareholders equity reflects the $13 billion in share repurchases. As we mentioned
last quarter, our targeted improvement in fixed charge coverage ratio is one to two turns over the next year or so
through both capital management and earnings growth. Towards that end, we recently announced a tender offer
targeting a number of our hybrids and legacy SunAmerica Securities.

We've been very clear about our intention to streamline our balance sheet and intend to execute on that plan in a very
disciplined manner. Between this tender offer, scheduled maturities and the hybrid calls that are available to us, we
believe that we will have made substantial progress towards our liability management goals in 2013. Anything else
beyond this for the remainder of the year is likely to be opportunistic. We continue to optimize our capital structure
across the enterprise on an ongoing basis.
During the fourth quarter we invested $500 million in our Life and Retirement companies and a strategic cornerstone
investment in PICC Group that Bob earlier referenced. The Life and Retirement companies and our Property Causality
companies are teaming up to further develop our distribution and sales capabilities in China. Our insurance subsidiaries
remain well capitalized and above their CMA thresholds and they are well positioned to deliver dividends to the
holding company going forward.
The new CMA levels are effective in 2013 and reset based on our annual refresh of rating agency and regulatory capital
models. The Property Casualty CMA level declined due to the exclusion of the deferred tax asset from the computation
and the Life and Retirement CMA level declined due to the reduction in rating agency minimum requirements and
greater capital efficiency from the consolidation of several Life and Retirement legal entities. Cash flow remains
strong, despite that of the effects of storm Sandy.
Slide eight illustrates the pace of the quarterly distributions from the insurance subsidiaries, which was over $5 billion
in 2012. In the fourth quarter, post-Sandy, we chose to make a $1 billion capital contribution to the Property Casualty
companies. We continue to expect $4 billion to $5 billion in annual dividends and distributions from our insurance
subsidiaries. Parent company available liquidity is over $16 billion, reflecting the recent AIA sale proceeds. As we
stated last quarter, the AIA sale generated about $2.5 billion in deployable capital.
And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter for greater detail of the Property Casualty results. Peter?
Peter D. Hancock
Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter marked continued progress towards achieving our
goals, increasing risk-adjusted profitability, and implementing our main strategic initiatives. This morning, I'll
comment on our quarterly performance, while discussing our underwriting improvements, efforts to reduce risk and
maximize capital efficiency, as well as several profitable growth opportunities.
Turning to slide nine, operating earnings exceeded $1 billion, excluding the $2 billion net Storm Sandy loss. This
reflects healthier underlying underwriting results and strong investment performance, partially offset by higher
expenses. The fourth quarter accident year loss ratio as adjusted improved to 63.3%, reflecting the steps we've taken to
refine business mix and enhanced risk selection through predictive modeling, technical price and account management
tools. The accident year loss ratio has improved approximately 3 points per annum over the last eight quarters, and we
expect that trend to continue in 2013.
Fourth quarter net premiums written were flat excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We experienced growth in
high value products and geographies offset by non-renewals on underperforming businesses primarily in U.S. Casualty.
The steps we're taking to improve business mix are producing more favorable underwriting results. We expect modest
real net premium growth in 2013 as we pursue new profitable business and corrective underwriting actions begin to
stabilize.
In the fourth quarter, net prior-year adverse development was a modest $116 million or 0.2% of total reserves. This was
primarily driven by adverse development in Casualty, partially offset by favorable development in financial lines and
Property. During the quarter, we completed our annual reserve study of workers' compensation and other long-tail
lines, which supported current reserve levels. Despite the long-tail nature of workers' compensation, the work we've
done to identify the structural drivers of losses has increased our confidence in our reserve adequacy.
We continue to actively manage our runoff lines of business. In the fourth quarter, certain pre-2004, environmental
business was moved from the Commercial segment to Other to improve regulatory capital efficiency and claims

handling. We've revised prior period results to reflect the transfer of this business. This exposure is part of the same
portfolio that was subjected to a claim by claim review, which we discussed in previous quarters.
Although Storm Sandy was most unusual in its nature and path, we do not consider it an outsized event for AIG. Total
Sandy losses were 2.7% of AIG Property Casualty's shareholders' equity, which is in line with our risk appetite and
year comparisons. Over the past three years, we took deliberate steps to reduce U.S. Cat exposure generally. We've also
implemented flood supplements on renewals, instituted changes to deductibles and terms and conditions and have
pushed for rate increases, in particular, following Hurricane Irene, which mitigated the extent of Sandy's impact. Our
primary responsibility is to our customers and I'm pleased to say that our claims service was recently recognized as
best-in-class in response to Sandy by a major global broker.
This quarter, we provided additional disclosures on acquisition and general operating expenses to offer more
transparency on their main drivers. Acquisition costs grew as expected as high value business, including the direct
marketing channel, accounted for a greater proportion of our overall portfolio. We're comfortable with higher
acquisition expenses as we target business that will increase risk-adjusted profitability.
Our investments in technology, talent, and infrastructure impacted the general operating expense ratio, but we believe
these initiatives will reduce losses through better claims handling and analytics. In addition, they will drive shared
service efficiencies in mature markets and will also help us build scalable platforms to support our growth ambitions in
emerging markets.
In the fourth quarter, we recorded approximately $100 million in severance charges. In 2013, we expect that GOE will
approximate full year 2012 levels. We continue to expect a decline in GOE beginning in 2014.
Turning to slide 10, commercial insurance net premiums written were flat, excluding foreign exchange, a result of
growth in high value business offset by improved risk selection and rate discipline, particularly in U.S. Casualty.
In the fourth quarter, we entered into a new reinsurance program in U.S. excess casualty that reduced Commercials' net
premiums written by about 1%, but the agreement is expected to improve overall risk adjusted profitability.
We reported positive rate change in many of the areas, where it was most needed in the fourth quarter. U.S.
Commercial Insurance rates increased 8.6% and Property and Workers' Compensation rates in the U.S. increased by
14.6% and 12.4%, respectively. However, we continue to observe more competitive conditions in Europe and some
specialty lines.
Commercials' accident year loss ratio improved over five points on a full year basis and we believe, it should continue
to improve compared to full year 2012 results. However, I would not expect its progression to be linear given quarterly
fluctuations as evidenced in the fourth quarter comparisons.
Moving on to the Consumer business, as most of you are aware, Jeff Hayman recently resigned as the leader of the
business. I am working more closely with our experienced consumer management team to advance their business goals,
as I assume his role on an interim basis.
Our broad product set and multiple distribution networks provide significant opportunities for expansion and we
remained very bullish on this business.
Turning to slide 11, consumer's premium growth, excluding foreign exchange, was approximately 1% and we are
pursuing growth strategies across its two major lines of business. Direct marketing remains a focus for us and it
represents 15% of the consumer business.
In total, we wrote $1 billion in premiums in growth economies in the fourth quarter. We experienced strong growth in
Asia-Pacific excluding Japan, where premiums increased 15% and Latin America, which had 13% growth over the
prior year.
We pursued investments and joint venture agreements as part of our international expansion plans. A good example is
AIGs investment in the PICC Group, which strengthens our partnership with the PICC, Property Casualty Company

We have also achieved profitable growth through our long-term accident and health relationship with PICC and we're
excited about additional consumer opportunities in China.
We recently announced a bancassurance agreement with HSBC. AIG will act as the exclusive provider of non-life
insurance products to customers in Turkey and France through this agreement. We anticipate it will significantly
enhance our ability to market A&H products in Turkey, one of our strategic business expansion countries.
In Israel, we purchased our partner's 50% share in AIG Israel, a successful direct marketing business with strong
in-country brand recognition.
Slide 12, demonstrates our investment portfolio mix. Fourth quarter net investment income increased 21%, reflecting
strong alternative investment returns. We achieved greater diversification by further reducing our concentration in
municipal bonds and investing in higher yield securities while remaining aligned with AIG's overall risk appetite.
We made $902 million in dividend payments to AIG Parent in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year 2012 total to
$2.5 billion before the $1 billion capital contribution that David referred to. Our capital efficiency efforts, which
include legal entity simplification and restructuring of reinsurance arrangements helped make 2012 our largest dividend
paying year in recent history.
2012 included a series of achievements that contributed to advancing AIG Property Casualty's intrinsic value. Our shift
to high value business and underwriting improvements produced better margins. We maintained our focus on capital
efficiency and optimizing our risk profile. Finally, investments in our business, people and profitable growth
opportunities provided us with a strong competitive advantage.
In closing, I'm satisfied with the progress we've made, and I'm confident that we'll build on our success in 2013.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jay.
Jay S. Wintrob
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin on page 13.
AIG Life and Retirement delivered another strong quarter with operating income growth of 20% for the quarter and
27% for the full year. Our results continue to benefit from actions on both the asset and liability sides of the balance
sheet to manage spread income in the current interest rate environment, from growth in assets under management and
related fee income growth, aided by strong fixed income and equity markets and from continued expense management.
The fourth quarter also benefited from strong alternative investment returns, a $57 million gain on our investment in
PICC Group and a net favorable DAC and reserve unlocking of $41 million. These items were partially offset by less
favorable individual life mortality results, though still in line with pricing assumptions, and a loss recognition reserve
strengthening of $61 million on legacy long-term care business written between 1997 and 2001. We no longer write
long-term care insurance and have total run off reserves of $245 million.
For the full year, operating income was $4.2 billion, up from $3.3 billion last year, due in large part to improved net
investment spreads. While reported earnings growth will be challenging this year due to continued low interest rates
and certain one-time positives this year, in 2012, we will continue to proactively address the low rate environment and
actively manage net investment spreads.
As David mentioned, in the fourth quarter, AIG Life and Retirement was a significant contributor to capital
management, providing $440 million of liquidity to the holding company through dividends and distributions from our
operating Life companies thus, bringing our full year 2012 total to $2.9 billion. Our year end RBC ratio is estimated at
approximately 510%, well above our capital maintenance agreement threshold of 385%.
In the fourth quarter, sales results once again reflect the value of our diversified business model. Variable annuity sales
were strong at $1.2 billion in the quarter, just short of our high watermark in the second quarter of 2012. For the full

year, VA sales were an all-time record $4.6 billion, up 42% versus 2011.
As Bob mentioned, we benefited from some dislocation in the VA market this year, although we remain a relatively
small percentage of industry sales. More importantly, our competitive product offerings designed and priced with risk
control as a primary goal, were embraced by the market. Longer term, we would expect product innovation and
broadening distribution to continue to drive sales. And looking ahead to this year, VA sales growth should continue,
although not at the same growth rate as in 2012.
Fixed annuity sales did improve sequentially in the quarter, but do remain low relative to historical levels. Lower fixed
annuity sales and an increase in large group surrenders at VALIC contributed to negative net flows for the fourth
quarter. We also voluntarily waived certain surrender restrictions on VALIC contracts with high-guaranteed minimum
rates, which contributed to the higher surrender activity.
While we're taking actions to improve our deposit growth in 2013, through expanded distribution and growth initiatives
in all of our business lines, low interest rates, should they continue, are expected to restrain fixed annuity sales growth
in particular.
We completed the merger of six life insurance operating legal entities into American General Life Insurance Company
at year end 2012. Besides improving the capital efficiency of our remaining three life operating companies and
providing expense savings, this merger along with our reorganized and united distribution organization will make it
easier for distribution firms and producers to do business with us and better position us to sell multiple products across
all of our distribution channels. We plan to modify our presentation of results to reflect our new organizational
structure in the first quarter of this year.
We mentioned our investment in the PICC Group earlier and in close collaboration with our colleagues at AIG Property
Casualty, we are currently negotiating a definitive agreement with PICC Life Insurance Company to establish a joint
venture to distribute life insurance and other insurance products through a specialized agency force with the focus on
major cities in China, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.
We're also negotiating reinsurance and other economic sharing agreements with PICC Life for jointly developed
products. We'll be providing more information on these activities once the final agreements are executed with PICC
Life.
Moving on to slide 14, we've provided additional information on our asset allocation and investment portfolio yields.
While portfolio base yield for the full year increased to 5.43%, we continue to see modest pressure as we reinvest
currently at lower rates. The fourth quarter base yield of 5.33% is down from the third quarter base yield of 5.38% and
of course down from the 5.44% a year ago. As we mentioned in our press release, our total yield in the quarter
benefited from strong alternative investment returns and the gain on our PICC stock investment.
Our total fourth quarter yield, as reported, of 6.09% is up from 5.86% in the third quarter and 5.33% a year ago. This
quarter alternative investment returns were higher than our expected trend, while the fourth quarter a year ago was
below expected trend and full year total yield again was 6.04% versus 5.63% a year ago.
Turning to slide 15, we continue to proactively manage net investment spreads Western National crediting rates
declined both sequentially and year-over-year contributing to the improvement in net investment spreads. VALIC's
crediting rates have been relatively stable, since the second quarter and spreads have consequently declined due to
slightly lower portfolio yields, both due to lower reinvestment yields and the fact that we have been repositioning the
VALIC portfolio to improve credit quality. Close to two thirds of our fixed annuity and universal life account values
are currently at guaranteed minimum crediting rates, up from 45% at the end of 2011.
In closing, with a very solid 2012 August behind us, we remained focused on our strategic initiatives for 2013:
increasing sales of profitable products; proactively managing interest spreads; growing our assets under management;
increasing our life insurance in force; and of course improving our return on equity.
At this time, I'll turn it back to David.

David L. Herzog
Thank you, Jay. On slide 16, you'll see the growth and improving operating trends of our Mortgage Guarantee business.
The loss in the quarter was due to a reserve strengthening, which was tied to more conservative assumptions for the
cure rates, which I think Bob referenced earlier.
So with that, I would like to turn it back to Liz for Q&A.
Elizabeth A. Werner
Thank you, David. And Operator, can we open it up for questions now?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks. Peter, maybe I have one question on – you commented on the three point loss ratio
improvement, is that in just U.S. commercial or is that overall commercial, or across the entire book? And can you help
us understand what is driving that? Is it mix or in the future, do you expect it to be less mix and more kind of a
rate-driven margin? And just one follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: It's – to be precise, if you draw a trend line through the total P&C accident year loss ratio
over eight quarters, it's an annualized decline of about 2.6% per annum. It's a bit more of a rapid improvement in the
fourth quarter, but that's slightly out of line of trend because you had an elevated number in Q4 2011 versus a
depressed level in Q4 of 2012. So, as you normalize that out, you can think about an improving trend of about 2.6% per
annum.
It's a result of a number of initiatives that we have signaled very clearly, business mix shift as we re-underwrite out of
business lines where we had clear unattractive economics and managing the account relationships in multiline
relationships in an intelligent way to shift to a better mix of business by customer, by geography, but also through
greater use of analytics and technical pricing models and segmentation at a more granular level. And then finally,
through a number of initiatives to reduce claims leakage, where we are seeing significant benefits from applying
analytics to fraud management and other management of legal expense and other factors.
So, we continue to see progress, no letup in that trend and we're making a conscious tradeoff between expense and loss
ratio as we improve the quality and repeatability of our business.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: So, when you look ahead, it sounds like so you're going to have – you expect to see
continued improvement on the loss ratio. The expense ratio is higher as you make these investments, but that should
begin to recede in 2014. So, the net should be – the overall combined continuing to fall once you get to 2014 and
beyond. Is that kind of how I should read that comment?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Correct. Correct.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thank you.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: We stand-by our aspirational goals that we laid out 18 months ago, which have an ROE of
the business north of 10%, an expense ratio – I mean a combined ratio between 90% and 95% and that the interplay
between that combined ratio target and the ROE target is a function of interest rate environment. And so, we feel that
we're on the path and continuing to implement the initiatives I mentioned.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. Thank you.

For our next question, we go to Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking the call. So, love to start with Peter. And first
of all, say thank you from all the investors who you guys must have spent a year working on the improvements to
disclosures in the K and sort of crystallizing the story. And, so, normally I ask a more detailed question, I'm not sure
that I have to this time.
I'd love to ask a higher level thing though, which is related – as you – sort of following up on Mike's commentary,
when you add up a couple of points, it sounds like three is a reasonable target of loss ratio improvement next year and
you assume that continues for perhaps into 2014. And then you assume that expenses start to improve as well when we
get to 2014. Is it right to say that sort of implicitly you guys think you'll be running in a low 90s accident year ex-cat
combined ratio by 2014?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think that we haven't provided specific guidance on ex-cat. So, I wouldn't want to go
beyond what we've indicated as our goal which is 90 to 95 combined which includes a normalized cat number in it. I
would also reemphasize what I've said many times before, that I prefer to view the combined ratio at ROEs as
outcomes of what we're really trying to optimize, which is growth in risk adjusted profitability, which is – may give
rise to a slightly higher or lower combined than the numbers I mentioned or ROE, because we're looking at the quantity
and quality of earnings to really get that balance right between profitability growth and risk but we believe that doing
so is completely consistent with the guidance we've given to date on those aspirational goals.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: That's helpful. Thank you. David, I wanted to switch over and just talk about capital for
briefly. Thank you for the clarification on sort of the debt tender and generally, I think I understood you to say it was
you guys are looking to only do opportunistic things once you sort of cover the two debt deleveraging initiatives you've
targeted.
The question I'd love to talk a little bit more about, not the rating agencies, but rather is the Fed. Your Chairman had a
bunch of interesting comments in your letter around how closely the board has been working with the Fed. I'd love to,
if you guys can sort of bring us up-to-date broadly on what all the things you did to get the Fed ready and where you
are now in terms of conversations with the Fed and ultimately sort of when you will or perhaps if you already have had
sort of the conversations around establishing what the level of capital a firm like AIG needs in the world it now exists
in?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah, sure. I'll start off, Josh and welcome others to join in. I would characterize the
conversations with the Fed really as constructive, open and frequent. I think is the clearest way I can describe that for
you.
So, with that as a backdrop, we're not going to comment on specifics, but again we continue to work with the Fed to
prepare ourselves for what we believe will ultimately be designated as a SIFI and we've taken great steps to prepare
ourselves through mock exams, through enhanced documentation of procedures and the like and processes and risk
limits and the like, working hand-in-hand with Sid Sankaran, our Chief Risk Officer, and then our Treasury Group in
terms of providing reporting and controls around liquidity and stress tests and forecasts. So, as we prepare ourselves for
eventual SIFI designation, we'll put ourselves as best we can to carry on with the capital management objectives that
we've laid out. But again, I would go back to my first characterization, constructive, open and frequent.
So, with that, Bob, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: No. I think David covered it well. They're here. There is a lot to be looked at. We have
some days you wish you could have a simple company, but then we wouldn't be AIG. So, they're working through it
and they're doing it very effectively and we have a good partnership and I'm sure that they will be able to get a better
sense of us in the months to come, but it's a long road because there is a lot to learn.

<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: That's helpful. Just very briefly, David, the debt tender that you guys have just
announced, those are for hybrids that at least in the old days would have been thought of as sort of capital for purposes
of the Fed. Did you have to sort of satisfy to them that you guys would be sufficiently well capitalized after you
reduced your capital for that – for the tender that's on track to be completed?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah. We're well – again, we're in the tender, I think, but we're not going to comment on any
specific conversations we've had with our colleagues at the Fed. Again, I think we're targeting those securities that are
most efficient and effective for us in terms of our capital structure, the cost of them and the like. So, I think we – as
we've done in the past, we've targeted our capital management activities to those securities that are most beneficial to
our many stakeholders.
Brian, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: No. I think that sums it up and again, these are securities that are generally viewed as
having sort of low capital content and certainly, looking forward into what we anticipate will be the regime in which
these securities will be evaluated, they'll have even less capital credit in the future.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Okay. Thanks so much.

We now move to Randy Binner with FBR.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the reserves in particular with the 10-K data,
there was kind of continued drag from excess in Primary Casualty, so a couple of questions there. One, was that drag
mostly legacy? It kind of looks like it, meaning 2002 and prior and how should we think about the 2002 and prior
years, because they obviously had significant drag before the last two years, but now it seems like it's a deficiency of
maybe $0.5 billion a year? Can we get some color on kind of where that stuff is coming from, from an adverse
perspective and if we kind of plan on $0.5 billion of drag there from the 2002 and prior going forward?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I'm going to ask – this is Peter Hancock. I'm going to ask Charlie Shamiah, our Chief
Actuary, to comment on that. But I would not in any way annualize any number that you just did in terms of deficiency.
We look at our reserves on a quarterly basis with a clean slate every time to make sure that we are adequate in any
given time. So, any kind of correlation of adjustments up or down from quarter-to-quarter is entirely coincidental. So,
why don't we turn over to Charlie?
<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: I'd just respond to your question about the excess casualty line and in terms of legacy
versus current business, the vast majority of that was actually related to a run-off portfolio in our public entity business,
general liability. And that is – the number in the 10-K represents the latest quarter and also prior quarters where we saw
deteriorating experience. That portfolio has been in run-off since 2008.
On the Primary Causality side, the main driver of that was more general liability and especially on property damage
and it was much more of a severity issue, as we disclosed in the 10-K and coming from more recent years. And we
don't see any of that as an indicator of future adverse development, we believe the reserves are very adequately set to
our best estimate today.
<Q - Randy Binner>: And then, one that – that's helpful. I mean, it's just, there is an above average amount of legacy
reserve drag from AIG versus other insurers. So that's helpful added color. The other question I had is, the D&O had a
favorable result in 2012 and so, just kind of some color on what accident years that came from and how that's trending?
<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: Well, the main year in D&O which was favorable in financial services was the 2010 year.
And as we're emerging from the – what we had referred to earlier as the credit crisis years, we have a lot more data and
actual reported claims and pays on those claims and they are coming in more favorably than we had anticipated. And
that was the major driver of the $307 million favorable result in 2012.

<A - Peter D. Hancock>: John Doyle, do you want to elaborate on that?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: I think we're – there's been a lot of commentary on the financial lines business overall, I've
heard from others markets and we have a terrific book, a well-diversified book around the world that continues to
perform well, and we saw growth in the portfolio. We saw improved rate in the portfolio during the course of the year
as well. So, financial lines is a mix of products. So there are certain segments in the U.S. market, primarily, that do
need some improvement and we're focused on that, but we continue to be very pleased with our business there overall.
<Q - Randy Binner>: So in layman's terms though, the kind of concerns a lot of people had about D&O exposure from
the financial crisis seem – it seems that those are fading and at the same time you are getting rate going forward and so
that's the dynamic right now in D&O broadly speaking?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Yeah, I think that's right. I think we probably have a better balanced book than some as well.
But, yeah, we continue to get improved pricing and terms in the book and although most of that's in the U.S. it's a bit
more competitive from a price point of view outside of the U.S., but yeah, we continue to be pleased with that business
overall.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Oh, that's great. Thank you.

And now we move to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Just quickly following up on Randy's question. I noticed there were some deficiencies in 2005
and 2007, which is somewhat irregular given what we've seen elsewhere. Can you talk about those years in particular?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think you'll have to elaborate on your question, Josh.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Yeah, if I break out the development for 2012 by accident year, I get very favorable results in
2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, deficiencies prior to 2002 and then I get a mixed bag in the hard market years, some were
redundant, but were some were deficient. But I don't see too many companies out there reporting any deficiencies from
the hard market years.
<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: A lot of the movements that you're observing, which as a percentage of reserves, are very
trivial, less than 1%, are really attributable to some large losses that we had reported in the 10-K that go back to those
accident years, especially on our occurrence based casualty lines of business where that is not an unusual occurrence.
So, it's very hard to extract a trend from the numbers that you're looking at as that's not at all the way that we look at it.
I'd draw your attention, for example, Josh to the disclosure on page 94 for the healthcare business, which gives an
indication of just that occurrence.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Okay. I'll pay close attention there. And then, on the debt repurchase, can you contrast what
you've currently reported to your thoughts about debt refinancing some of the hybrids as opposed to repurchasing them
and if you're going to repurchase, why not start with the callable bonds that are trading at par rather than ones trading at
premiums?
<A - David L. Herzog>: I think, Josh, the simple way to think about it or the cleanest way to think about that is we
maintain financial flexibility to the largest extent possible and the callables are – the calls are available to us and it
gives us the flexibility that we desire.
Brian, you want to comment further?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: No, I think you summed it up well. We believe by doing the tender first and having the
calls available, we'll be able to most effectively meet our liability management goals for the year.

<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: And any thought about issuing some debt to give yourselves greater flexibility for
repurchasing some of the hybrids?

And for our next question we move to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yes. Thank you. Couple of questions, maybe the first one for Peter. Can you talk about what
you're seeing from a pricing standpoint in 2013 and January, you must have some data already?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, I think – I'll have also John to elaborate on this, but I think that for the most part we
continue to see continued improvement in rate in the U.S. commercial lines. And that's good news, because it was
needed there. So, we're getting closer to rate adequacy, but we're still not at rate adequacy in the longer-tail casualty
line. So, just ways to go.
Europe is softer, but we're starting from a much more rate adequate environment there. And in a couple of specialty
lines, we're actually seeing a softer market, in particular in aviation.
But, John, if you want to elaborate on that, perhaps you want to add to that.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Jay, I think Peter hit the theme. Casualty pricing in the fourth quarter in the U.S. for us was up
just about 10%. Property pricing was up 14%. We expect continued casualty pricing improvement in 2013 and so far,
it's met expectations. So, there was a lot of capacity out there. So, I do think the larger players in the market are being
disciplined and the reality is that the entire industry needs to drive a better underwriting result given the current interest
rate environment.
So pricing is moving in the right direction there and you know we're not just relying on pricing, we're focused
obviously on a lot of other levers that Peter mentioned, in terms of mix, better terms, better engineering, better
underwriting tools, et cetera, claims tools that will drive further improvement, but price continues to move in the right
direction there.
1/1 is a big continental Europe renewal date, a little bit better than the fourth quarter, but again lagging on the U.S.as
Peter indicated. So we're optimistic about the environment, there are, you know, other geographies where property
pricing has been improving, which is important to us.
And so, we think, we don't see much to get in the way in the near term of some decent pricing improvements in the
early part of 2013.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: That's great. Thank you. The second question, if I look at the proceeds from AIA and the
eventual proceeds from ILFC, it doesn't sound like you'll be using them either for buybacks and you certainly won't be
using all of that for debt repayment. What should we assume in the near-term happens to those proceeds? They'll – I
guess, they'll generate some investment income and where will that show up in your numbers?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Jay, its David. Again, we haven't – we've not given a projection about future capital actions,
capital management actions that we will take. As we've said, we remained committed to the $25 billion to $30 billion
over the period through 2015 and I think a safe assumption would be that we'll put the money to work at the parent
company level for a period of time until we assess our financial flexibility and our capital position, our liquidity
position and then carry on with the capital management. Bill?
<A - William N. Dooley>: Yeah, Jay. We're in the process because cash now is building up at the parent level and
we've already sat down between the risk group and the investment group and the capital management group to look at
exactly what free cash will emerge over this period of time and into the future for the parent. The parent over the last

few years has not had excess cash to any great degree to invest in longer term security.
So, we're in the process right now of putting together investment plans. We've already started to invest some of the
money in very conservative investments at the moment to get additional yield and additional investment income. And
that will...
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: And does that show up in the capital markets earnings? Where would it show up in your actual
presentation?
<A - William N. Dooley>: In the parent.
<A - David L. Herzog>: They'll show up in the parent.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Okay. Thanks.

And we'll move now to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, for Peter, you mentioned you expect
the loss ratio to improve over time and if I look at the loss ratio ex-cats and development in the fourth quarter, the
63.6%, it was one of the best levels you've had in a long, long time. So, do you expect an improvement off of these
levels as well or was this partly because of just unusually low non-cat claims?
And then maybe for Bob, on capital management, you mentioned several actions, debt reduction, buybacks, dividends,
do you expect to do these simultaneously or should we expect that you'd reduce the debt and improve your coverage by
like the one to two turns you mentioned before paying dividends or resuming buybacks?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I would take you back to an earlier question where I tried to give as much guidance as to
how to think about the trend in accident year loss ratio. Look at the eight quarters, the last eight quarters, do a
regression line through them and see that the fourth quarter of last year is below that trend line. That trend line is
declining at a rate of about 2.6% points per year, 2.6 points per year. That's not a bad estimate for what we think will
happen going forward. So, yes, there is a little bit of a fair wind in the fourth quarter, but I think that continued
improvement is embedded in our expectations and our strategy. So, I think that's a fair assumption to make.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: On the capital management side, that – what we've said is, we need to – some of it's
geography and some of it is reducing interest expense and some of it is – which would be our debt reduction and
improving profits. All of that gets you a better coverage ratio, covered by the operating companies. And so, that's our
highest priority, continues to be our highest priority. We are working very closely with the rating agencies to make sure
they are comfortable. Keep in mind that we came out of this crisis much more rapidly than anybody – I won't say
anybody, but I'm not sure there aren't more than two or three of you on the phone that was with us three years ago
realized when we'd get to where we are today. And so, the speed that this has occurred in, they just want more time to
see us continue to evolve with the good solid earnings that you've seen so far.
Having said that, as they continue to be comfortable, as we continue to perform through the year, we continue to make
progress on our coverage ratio, what I've said was, I would love to be able to put a dividend on the stock. I think that
makes sense, because it increases the number of potential shareholders for this company and as we continue to progress
through the year to the extent we could do a share buyback, we'd like to be able to do that as well. But we're going at a
pace, so that clearly – we're looking for, as you saw with two rating agencies already, [indiscernible] (57:31) pieces of
our company staring to turn positive and potential upgrades.
So, an upgrade to AIG over the next couple of years, I think would be the important statement that says, we have
accomplished a strong comeback as an investment grade company and that's the goal we have in 2015 is our

aspirational date and we're still marching pretty quickly towards that date and things we need to achieve for it.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay, got you. And then on the ILFC proceeds lastly, if we think about the sales price,
you're getting 90% of that, assuming that you end up selling 90%. You're putting back $1.1 billion into ILFC. If you
were to get out completely from ILFC, would you get that $1 billion back or that's sort of a permanent contribution
back to ILFC?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah, Jimmy, it's David. The – think of it as just a settlement of a intercompany pooling.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay.
<A - David L. Herzog>: A pooling the cash. So, it's going to go back to them when we close.
