MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Tabatha and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Actavis Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms.
DeFrancesco, please go ahead.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, Tabatha, and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Actavis second quarter 2014 earnings
conference call. Earlier this morning we issued a press release reporting Actavis' earnings for the second quarter ended
June 30, 2014. The press release together with additional materials including slides and reconciling GAAP and
non-GAAP financial results and forecasts are available on our website at www.actavis.com. We are conducting a live
webcast of this call, a replay of which will also be available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's
call is copyrighted material of Actavis and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's express written consent.
Turing to slide two, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make projections or
other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's
important to note that such statements about estimated or anticipated Actavis results, prospects, or other non-historical

Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and production, depending on a number of factors
affecting the Actavis business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including but not limited to the Actavis PLC Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2013 as
amended by the 8-K. Actavis disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements, except as
expressly required by law.
Turning to slide three. With us on todays call are Paul Bisaro, our Executive Chairman who will provide an overview
of the second quarter business highlights for Actavis; Todd Joyce, our Chief Financial Officer who will then discuss
Actavis' second quarter results in more detail. Following Todd, Brett Saunders, our new CEO and President will give
highlights of Forest's calendar year second quarter performance, detail our outlook for the remainder of 2014 and
provide an overview of our full year 2015 expectations. Brent will also detail our roadmap for accelerated growth of
our newly combined company.
Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Bob Stewart, our Chief Operating Officer; Bill Meury, Executive
Vice President of Commercial Operations for North American Brands; David Buchen, Executive Vice President of
Commercial Operations for North American Generics and International; and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer. If
you are not on the webcast, we have slides accompanying our presentation available at ir.actavis.com.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thank you Lisa, and good morning everyone and thanks for joining the call. Turning to slide five, we are pleased to
report another exceptionally strong quarter for Actavis. Second quarter net revenues increased 34% to approximately
$2.7 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased 70% to $3.42 in the second quarter, and adjusted
EBITDA increased 82% to $862 million.
Turning to slide six, our Actavis North American Brands business reported revenues of $587 million. Certain key
products including the Asacol/Delzicol franchise, Minastrin and Doryx under-performed relative to expectations as a
result of the continued impact from the sales force transition which occurred earlier this year. Now, with the addition of
the Forest team, we are optimistic we can continue growth for Lo Loestrin, Estrace Cream and Rapaflo while
stabilizing the Asacol/Delzicol, Minastrin and Doryx franchises. In our oral contraceptive franchise, Lo Loestrin has
become a key promotional focus with its unique low dose profile and the durability of the IP portfolio surrounding the
product.
Moving to our North American Generics business on slide seven, our limited competition products in the U.S. market
including generic versions of Lidoderm, Concerta, Adderall XR and others continued to drive exceptional performance
during the second quarter. Our over-performance resulted from lower than anticipated competition on generic versions
of Lidoderm and Cymbalta.
A key highlight was our announcement of the extension of our exclusive authorized generic agreement with Janssen
Pharmaceuticals covering Concerta, now continuing through the end of 2017. In Canada we became the fifth largest
generic company, and the fastest grower amongst the top five in the Canadian generic market. We have seven
additional product launches planned in Canada this year.
Moving to our International business on slide eight. Following the divestiture of our Western European commercial
businesses earlier this year, our remaining businesses in Ireland, the UK, the Nordics, and Continental Europe
continued to perform well. In fact, we are now the second largest generic company in Ireland. In addition, we recently
launched several important OTC products in Finland and Switzerland. Notwithstanding the difficulties in the region,
our business continues to outperform the market in Russia and CIS as we expand our OTC presence in the region.
Following the acquisition of Silom Medical in the beginning of the second quarter, Actavis is now the fourth largest
generic company in the Thai market, another building block for expanding our presence in Southeast Asia.

On slide nine, our generic pipeline continued to expand in the first half of 2014, with 24 ANDA filings in the U.S.
market, 11 of which could be potential first-to-file opportunities. Despite concerns otherwise, there is no shortage of
opportunities for generic development in the U.S. market. In the first half of the year, we have identified 41 new
products for development, the majority of which are first-to-file or potential first-to-market opportunities. Outside the
U.S., we continue to see ample development opportunities, as Actavis and Medis have filed close to 1,000 marketing
authorizations in the first half of the year.
As you can see, the Actavis business is strong and has now been further strengthened with the addition of the Forest
portfolio of products and its strong commercial team. After being one team for just four weeks, I'm even more excited
about the future as we come together to build a new breed of pharmaceutical companies. A little later, Brent will set out
our expectation for the combined company, but first let me turn the call over to Todd who will provide more details on
Actavis' second quarter results. Todd?
Robert Todd Joyce
Thanks Paul. I will now review our second quarter results on a divisional and consolidated basis. Turning to slide 13,
consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $2.667 billion, an increase of 34% over the prior-year period,
reflecting strong growth in both our Actavis pharma and Anda distribution segments.
GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $158 million compared to $136 million in the prior-year period, an
increase of 16%. Non-GAAP R&D investment was $185 million.
On a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate was 17.1% in the second quarter, down from 26.9% in the prior-year
period of as a result of the acquisition of Warner Chilcott. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization,
impairment charges, acquisition related expenses and other items detailed in table four of our earnings press release,
and detailed further in the non-GAAP reconciliations available on our website, earnings for the second quarter were
$3.42 per diluted share, up 70% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $862 million compared
to $475 million in the prior year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was strong at $470 million.
Turning to slide 12, net revenue on our Actavis Pharma segment was $2.24 billion, up 31% year-over-year due to the
acquisition of Warner Chilcott, better than expected performance from our U.S. Generics business and strong
International performance. North American brand revenue was $587 million, up from $145 million in the prior year
period due to the acquisition of Warner Chilcott. Within North American Brands, net revenue in our women's health
portfolio was $231 million, up from $21 million in the prior year. Revenue from our urology and GI portfolio was $215
million, up from $56 million in the prior year, and revenue from our dermatology and established brands portfolio was
$142 million, up from $68 million in the second quarter of 2013.
Revenue for our key branded products is provided in the appendix at the conclusion of this presentation. North
American Generic revenues was $1.031 billion for the quarter, up 9% from $950 million in the second quarter of 2013.
The increase was driven by new product launches including the generic versions of Lidoderm and Cymbalta, which
performed ahead of expectations in the quarter, partially offset by competition on certain extended release products,
including our authorized generic version of Concerta.
Finally, International revenue, which consists of all revenue derived outside of North America, was $622 million
compared to $620 million in the second quarter of 2013. The current year period reflects our divestiture of our Western
European markets to Aurobindo on April 1. The current year period includes $37.3 million of revenue from our
divested generic operations related to the continued supply revenue from those markets. Revenue from this supply
arrangement is excluded for non-GAAP reporting purposes.
Actavis Pharma's adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 64.8%, up from 53.9% in the prior year period, primarily
due to the addition of the Warner Chilcott portfolio. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue for
Actavis Pharma in the second quarter was 20.7%, down from 22% in the prior-year period.

Turning to slide 13, net revenue from our distribution segment was $427 million, up 55% on volume increases and new
third-party launches. Anda's gross margin for the quarter was 12.3%, down from 13.4% in the second quarter of 2013,
primarily due to product mix. Anda's SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter was 8.4%, down
from 11.1% in the prior-year period on significantly higher revenues.
Slide 14 shows that cash and marketable securities were $4.3 billion at the quarter end, primarily due to cash received
from the senior notes offering to fund the Forest Laboratories acquisition. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio shortly
after funding the Forest acquisition was 3.52 times, reflecting the strong performance of both businesses prior to the
close. With that I'll turn the call over to Brent, for details on Forest calendar second quarter performance and our
outlook for the combined company. Brent?
Brenton L. Saunders
Thanks, Todd. Turning to slide 16. Forest had strong performance in the calendar second quarter with over $1.1 billion
in net revenue. Revenue growth of 41% was powered by the Aptalis acquisition, new launches and continued strong
product performance from Namenda, Linzess, our anti-depressant line and Bystolic.
Namenda XR accounted for approximately 42% of total Namenda volume at the end of the quarter, and is
approximately 46% of the total volume today. We continue to focus on transitioning the franchise to the XR version by
year-end. Patient and caregiver response to the Namenda XR product has been exceptionally positive, and as we have
previously stated, the successful conversion of Namenda XR is based on three things: patient, caregiver and healthcare
provider responding favorably to the benefits of the once-daily dosing of the Namenda XR product; ensuring that we
achieve appropriate levels of managed care coverage and formulary planning; and ensuring that we optimize the
efficiency of our manufacturing capabilities to ensure adequate supply to support the ultimate conversion to the XR
product. Conversion rates are demonstrating patient and payer acceptance of the benefits of the single daily dose.
Managed care coverage rates remain high, in fact nine out of the ten Part D plans cover XR. We continue to make
progress in improving manufacturing yield and efficiency. Our decision to defer final conversion to the Namenda XR
product until later this year will not affect our ability to meet the financial objectives we have set for this product line.
The Linzess DTC campaign, which started early in the calendar second quarter, continues to raise awareness about
IBS-C and demand is significantly increasing for the product with both primary care physicians and gastroenterologists.
Approximately two out of three new patients are coming from the OTC market. And sales of our anti-depressant
franchise, with promotion behind both Viibryd and Fetzima continue to climb.
On the branded R&D front, we are excited to welcome David Nicholson to Actavis and look forward to his leadership
in harmonizing our combined development portfolio and accelerating our progress.
Previously it was Forest's practice to announce NDAs on filing, but we have now adopted the industry practice to
publicly announce on acceptance for filing. As a bridge to the policy, we are disclosing that we expect to be in a
position to announce the acceptance of filing for eluxadoline and ceftazidime/avibactam combination later this quarter.
Turning to slide 17. Actavis and Forest have been actively planning for integration since February and following the
July 1 close. We are hard at work to achieve rapid integration and maximize synergy capture. Our goal is to use this
integration as an opportunity for transformation. We want to exit the process as a more efficient company with the right
teams in place to drive continued long-term growth. We are working tirelessly to make sure we strike the right balance
between cost cutting and investing in the future of our business. Today, we are approximately one month into the
operation of the combined company.
To provide investors with insight into our vision for the company and the value of this combination, we will today
provide a forecast for the remainder of 2014, as well as an initial forecast for 2015. It has been Actavis' practice to give
yearly guidance and our view of the out years at our Annual Investor Conference in early January. Given the unique
circumstances with this combination, we are significantly advancing this activity so we can share our excitement about
the value creation of this combination. I would ask investors to recognize that this is an initial forecast. We will provide

updates and revisions as we move forward and as we develop more actual experience operating as a single company.
But I believe that this initial forecast offers a sound foundation for understanding the potential of the new Actavis.
As you can see on slide 19, we are providing two important data points, our forecast for the second half of 2014 as a
combined company, and our first look at 2015. We expect to report second half 2014 earnings of $6.25 to $6.50. This
includes Forest as of July 1 and a blended share count of 222 million shares for the full year of 2014. For our first full
year as a combined company, 2015, our initial estimate reflects an initial forecast for a full year earnings between
$15.60 to $16.80. This estimate reflects strong earning growth on a pro forma basis, as if the transaction had closed on
the first day of 2014, of 25% to 35% when compared to our full year 2014 forecast.
On slide 20 we have detailed our expectations for R&D, SG&A, adjusted EBITDA and shares. I would draw your
attention to the SG&A and R&D estimates. We have decided to invest in the business to grow our product franchises
and support our pipeline. It is the right thing to do to create long-term organic growth. While we remain absolutely
committed to capturing the synergies we've previously announced as quickly as possible, we will not sacrifice investing
in our products and pipeline for long-term growth and our products will continue to receive our full support.
On slide 21 we've provided some additional second half 2014 revenue forecast detail for our North American Brands,
North American Generics, International and Anda distribution business. As you can see, we have a very balanced and
more diversified business as a combined company.
Turning to slide 22. We've provided franchise level revenue expectations for our North American Brands business.
Revenue growth in the second half of 2014 will be driven by continued growth of key franchises including women's
health, GI, cardiovascular and CNS, driven by key products such as Lo Loestrin, Estrace Cream, Linzess and Bystolic.
As we expected, our respiratory and dermatology franchise are undersized and may face some challenges, but we view
these as future opportunities to strengthen these franchises as a combined company.
As Paul stated earlier, the first half of the year for the legacy Actavis North American Brands business faced some
headwinds related to the sales force transition that continued to depress marketing activities into the second quarter. We
believe the combined company will have the resources to stabilize these franchises and working hard to do just that.
Slide 23 and 24 outline our assumptions for the North American Generics and specialty brand business for the
remainder of 2014. As we show on slide 23, in our U.S. generics business, we expect no additional competitive
launches for key products including generic Lidoderm. We also expect normal seasonality to favor a higher fourth
quarter performance when compared to the third quarter.
As you can see on slide 24, within our North American Brands business, we expect continued growth in our CNS, GI,
women's health and cardiovascular franchises, and key promoted products. This growth will be in part offset by modest
declines in Namenda and in Actonel, which now has generic competition. We expect that price increases will be
consistent with industry practice and expect no change to our formulary coverage.
I would also like to provide some additional comments on factors that have an impact on the overall second half
forecast in slide 25. In short, we are committed to continue investment in expanding our business, as demonstrated by
the completion of the acquisition of Furiex on July 2. We also expect, as we have stated throughout today's call, that we
will spend to support future growth in the business in both SG&A and R&D. We remain absolute in our commitment to
meeting and even beating our synergy target. We now anticipate that the second half will reflect a modest amount of
realized synergy, with the heavy lifting to occur in the fourth quarter, and ramp up by year-end to achieve a strong run
rate of synergy capture throughout 2015.
On slide 26 we provided our initial look at 2015, which we believe demonstrates the strength of the combination and
our opportunity to drive long-term growth. We expect to generate approximately $15 billion in revenue and non-GAAP
earnings per share of $15.60 to $16.80. As we stated earlier, this reflects an exceptional organic growth rate of 25% to
35%, maintaining our ability to pay down debt and continue to invest in the business to best position ourselves for our
future.

Our initial 2015 forecast includes high-level assumptions as outlined on slide 27. We expect to launch approximately
six products within our North American Brands business in 2015, and expect strong growth in key existing products
and franchises, while factoring in reductions in sales and earnings related to generic competition on Namenda, Actonel
and Generess.
In our generics business, we anticipate additional competition on key products including generic versions of Lidoderm
and Concerta. We expect a pricing environment consistent with 2014, and we expect growth both in the U.S. and
internationally driven by new product launches and expanded portfolios.
For 2015, as we stated earlier, we're focused on striking the right balance between cutting costs and making the right
investments to grow our business. We expect our SG&A as a percent of revenue to be slightly above 20% by year end.
For R&D, we will spend the remainder of the year with our new leadership team in place evaluating the return on
investment and timelines for a development pipeline. Free cash flow will be approximately $4 billion. We will continue
to refine this initial estimate in the coming quarters and update you as appropriate.
Finally, I want to outline our roadmap to accelerated growth as a combined company. Our strategy for accelerated
growth has three phases which build upon each other over time. First, we will focus on combining the two businesses,
then building for the future throughout 2015 and finally focusing on accelerating growth in 2016 and beyond. For the
remainder of this year our job is straightforward, make sure both the generics and brands business continue to deliver
results and keep the emphasis on investment in organic growth for the future, while accelerating our integration and
synergy capture.
As we build throughout 2015, the focus is on maintaining laser-like focus on the current brand and generic portfolios,
while building both businesses through new product launches and pipeline advancement. We will also continue to
optimize our global commercial engine and remain committed to our synergy achievement. 2014 and 2015 provide a
solid foundation for the opportunity to accelerate growth in 2016 and beyond. We will generate a significant amount of
cash that we can deploy along the way in strategic ways. We will focus our investment on adding long duration assets
to expand our franchise, with both marketed products and development pipeline, expanding our commercial presence in
strong growth markets outside the U.S. and selectively globalizing our existing franchises.
If we are successful in achieving all of this, and I'm confident that we will be, Actavis will experience accelerated
growth during 2016 and beyond with an aspirational goal of $20 per share in earnings. The combined company is
poised to capitalize on a wealth of opportunities as a new breed of pharmaceutical company. I couldn't be more excited
with the bright future that I see in front of me for Actavis. I believe that we have one of the strongest companies in the
industry, an experienced and motivated team and are committed to driving industry leading return for our shareholders.
With that, let me turn the call back to Lisa to get our Q&A underway.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Okay Tabatha, I think we're ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Hi, Jami, you there?
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay. I assume you can hear me. So you gave guidance for 2014 and 2015 and long-term
aspirational guidance of $20 in EPS by 2017. Brent, would you be willing to provide top line guidance beyond 2015? I
don't anticipate you're going to give us specific numbers, but if you can sort of qualitatively share with us your

aspirations for top line growth. And how do you marry the two businesses with brands being all about the focus on
growth and generics about profitability. Maybe you can comment on that. And then secondly, just based on the second
half R&D guidance of $700 million and your guidance for 2015 that assumes 8% of sales, is that the level of
investment that we should anticipate going forward? Thanks very much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Hey, Jami. Let me see if I can address all those questions. If I forget one just ask again.
I'm sorry.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So I think as we think about top line as you look at the generics business, I'm not sure
that top line is a good performance indicator for that business. It's really about bottom line. On the other hand, on the
branded side of the business, top line is a very important performance indicator, and so we are looking at ways to think
about balancing those two and look at guidance. I think where we're headed towards is really providing thoughts
around product franchises. And so I think as we think about where the organic growth is coming from on the branded
side, we feel we have a very strong story for organic growth and perhaps I'll ask Bill to chime in on his views of the top
line growth on the branded side.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes, Jami. This is Bill. There are I'd say five product lines that you'd want to focus on over
the next several years and that would be CNS, GI, cardio respiratory, women's health and anti-infectives, and we're
looking at double-digit growth rates. In the case of CNS, you'd have to exclude Namenda of course, but double-digit
growth rates over the next several years. In at least four out of those five categories, there's an anchor or a flagship
product. Eluxadoline from Furiex has got a lot of promise, ceftazidime/avibactam in the anti-infective space. Then of
course you know Cariprazine and then another product called Esmya, which is a women's health product. It's a
progesterone receptor modulator for uterine fibroids. And so, those five product lines and a flagship in each one of
them is probably going to tell the top line story for the next several years.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I think the second question you asked about R&D as a percentage of sales, you know you
think we just hired a new head of branded R&D. He started yesterday, David Nicholson. We are in the midst of doing a
portfolio review and we'll complete that now that once he gets grounded and we give him more than a day to be here.
And so we'll have a better thought there.
And in terms of the generics side of R&D, we have a team here that has led the way in first-to-files and ANDAs for a
few years now and we expect to ultimately be the beneficiaries of all that great work as the FDA starts to ultimately
approve some of these filings. And so we're committed to maintaining our leadership position in the generics industry
by investing in generic R&D.
So that being said, I think a percent of sales is not a good way to think about R&D. I think you have to look at the
opportunities and how you feel about them, and then the success rate of that group. And I would say our generic group
has proven to be best-in-class, and our branded group has got a new leader that's doing a portfolio review, and we'll
have a better thought around that probably at the next call or the next time I see you. Did I miss any of your questions,
Jami?
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: I guess we'll take our next question.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Hi Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Good morning, hi. So Brent, obviously you have a lot to do from an integration standpoint, but
in a market that seems to be addicted to M&A growth, M&A driven growth, how would you like to set expectations
around your desire to do deals with some color around the size, the flavor of deals, the pace of deals? Set the bar
however you'd like. And my follow-up is, in light of the changes in the distribution industry, is Anda still an asset that

belongs with Actavis? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. Thanks, Gregg. I was going to joke with you and say we did close one deal in July.
Furiex closed on July 2, so we're now into August and the team's looking at me, wondering what we're going to do in
the month of August. But I don't want to give them heart attacks.
Look, I think when you think of both Actavis under Paul and Forest for the year I was there, or slightly less than the
year I was there, both are companies that are willing to, and leadership teams that were willing to go out and do what
was necessary to strategically build the business for the long term. And I don't think anything has changed with respect
to that. So I think as we look at opportunities, we're currently focused on building out our therapeutic areas in North
American Brands. We're also equally looking at building out our geographic footprint around the world, places like
Latin America, Russia, Southeast Asia are great geographies where we are evaluating lots of opportunities.
And then third, we are looking at late-stage pipeline opportunities. I think that then the overhang on all of those are do
you do other transformational deals. And I think those you've got to think about more opportunistically, but I think if
we saw an opportunity that we believed would be strategically sound and drive continued long-term performance of our
organization with strong durable assets, we would avail ourselves of that opportunity if we thought it was right. So this
isn't a gun-shy team. This is a very proven M&A group that knows how to act on deals and integrate and we're very
comfortable. We know what we're doing and we've got the best team in the business, and so we'd be very comfortable
making those moves if we thought it was right for our shareholders.
I think with respect to Anda, as I've always said, there are no sacred cows in the company. We like Anda. We actually
have been surprised in one month, and albeit it's been one month since we've been operating as a combined company,
at some of the strategic soundness of having Anda and a branded business. Bill Meury and his team have been meeting
with the folks at Anda, and we're looking for ways to use Anda to launch new products, as well as service lower
promoted products with details and other things. So Anda has only become more strategic for us in a very short four
weeks.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Morning. A couple of questions. Firstly as a thought for Brent or Bill, regarding pricing on the
branded side of the business, do you have any incremental concerns regarding pricing push-back from payers on some
of the Forest products where generic alternatives are available? I'm thinking of two of your largest franchises, Bystolic
at the moment and Namenda XR going forward. Perhaps you can be a little bit more clear on your assumptions going
forward for both of those franchises.
And then my second question is on your respiratory portfolio. In light of the additional trial required for the Forest
LAMA/LABA, any thoughts on the potential divestiture of this portfolio of assets, especially taking into account the
agreement reached last week between Almirall and AstraZeneca and given AstraZeneca's strength and expertise in the
respiratory space, would it not be perhaps a better allocation of resources for the large sales force promoting your
respiratory products in primary position to be reallocated to areas of higher growth or perhaps to inorganic growth
opportunities?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. Let me take, Liav, let me take the second question first and we'll come back to
Namenda and Bystolic pricing with Bill. I think with respect to respiratory, as I said in my opening remarks, we do face
some challenges in the respiratory market. It is still a bit of an arms race therapeutic area, with lots of new product
entries, with lots of sales reps and lots of promotion. That being said, we have a very strong product in Teflaro and
Daliresp. And the combined franchise is doing well, perhaps not as well as we had hoped but doing well. And we are
still engaged in getting better managed care coverage, which has been improving over time, as well as hand-to-hand
combat in the doctors' offices. And there's a place for that therapy.

As we think about the LAMA/LABA, we've been working with Almirall and now we have AstraZeneca in the mix and
that's only a week old development. But we're going to sit down with them and talk about how we can continue to
advance that program in a smart, right way. We'll get David Nicholson involved in that discussion and absolutely
committed to it. That being said, just like I said about Anda, there are no sacred cows. So if somebody believes they're
a better owner for our products, then we'd like to hear from them. But as long as we own it, we're going to do
everything we possibly can to maximize it and be as competitive as possible.
With respect to pricing on Namenda and Bystolic, I think you have clearly very different situations. Namenda XR, this
is a strategy about bringing the best medicine to patients in one daily dose and making sure that we drive the
conversion in an appropriate way. And I think as you look at Namenda, the discounts that we have to offer on Namenda
and the price increases don't truly net out. And that will become a declining franchise, as I've always said. The question
is can we slow the rate of decline and manage the rate of decline, and I think we're confident we'll be able to execute
that. On Bystolic, the same type of situation. We can continue to take price increases, but rebate levels also continue to
climb. So we don't actually feel the full effect of those price increases and I'll ask Bill to add any color commentary to
that statement.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes Liav, it's a good question. I mean, we're very aware of the downward pressure on price.
I think all the companies are experiencing it. The good thing about Namenda and Bystolic right now is both products
are in a very strong position when you think about 2014 and 2015 in terms of formulary coverage, we don't expect any
surprises.
As it relates to price appreciation, I think usually you're getting something in the mid single digits, maybe a little bit
better, which is basically a composite of your actual price increase and any incremental rebates. I think Brent makes a
good point, that with XR it's a little bit different because we did make it economical for health plans to put XR in
formulary, and so volume was our aim with that product. But I think as we look forward to the next several quarters
and the next several years, mid single digits is a pretty good bet.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Ken C. Cacciatore>: I just wanted to know if you guys could give a sense of your risk profile versus large
pharmaceuticals. Is it different as you approach some of these late-stage development assets? Is there any way you can
give us a sense of your willingness to be aggressive, why they sometimes are on the sidelines and you all get a product,
or sorry, a company like a Furiex? Can you just expand on that?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes, I don't know, Ken, if it's necessarily a risk profile. I would point out, the one point I
made in the prepared remarks was that this combined business is highly diversified, both geographically and from a
product line and therapeutic perspective. And so with the exception of Namenda, which I think we have a very sound
strategy, there really aren't any one product or area that we have any real risks associated with that. They're long
durability assets where we have lots of diversity within the lines.
So I think we have a very good, positive risk profile vis-à-vis our competitors and others, but that's just my opinion. I
think the reason we can do a Furiex, or we find some of these gems, is because we're a big contrarian sometimes. We
like therapeutic areas where other people have walked away. And so when you think about GI, there really are no big
companies in GI anymore. We are the big company in GI, is perhaps the better way to say it.
And so Furiex was just, eluxadoline was an opportunity that I followed from my very first week at Forest, developing a
relationship with the management team at Furiex, following the data, and staying close to them so that when the time
came, we could move incredibly quickly without bureaucracy and get a deal done, which made it very favorable for

their team and their shareholders. So I think it's about staying close to your therapeutic areas. It's about staying focused.
It's about being ready to strike when the opportunities are hot.
So I think what you see at other companies is they just move kind of slow and cumbersome, and they have to go
through committee after committee after committee, and each committee is looking for reasons why not to do
something where here it's a very flat organization. The folks in this room and on this call make the decision. We do the
appropriate diligence, and we move. And that's just a big difference between us and everybody else, I think.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Leerink Partners.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Hey good morning, and thanks for taking the question. First question just on U.S. generic
pricing outlook for 2014 and 2015, just kind of curious if there is an opportunity for upside relative to your guidance of
mid single digit erosion, just in the context of a lot of smaller generic players seem to be taking very aggressive pricing
increases, and I'm wondering if you've factored any aggressive pricing increases of your own into numbers. And then
just as my follow-up question, just kind of curious your thoughts in terms of excluding Lidoderm competitors in the
second half of 2014, if there's anything new that you've learned there. Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. I'll ask David to weigh in here. But I think as you think about aggressive price
increase, we certainly didn't do that in our models. I think we've tried to stay consistent with 2014. Clearly we think
there are more opportunities to take price, particularly as we leverage our strong supply chain and the reliability of high
quality supply that we can offer customers that perhaps you're seeing with some of our competitors not to be as true.
And so that always creates opportunity. But David, you want to add some thoughts?
<A - David A. Buchen>: Sure. I mean, I think it's a dynamic environment. We have a very broad portfolio, and we
take pricing opportunities where we can. Some of those come along due to competitive problems with supply, things
like that. But then you also have situations where pricing will decline rapidly, things like duloxetine where we have
opportunities in the short term, but then they drop off. So we look for ways to offset those. And that's one of the
advantages of having a very diverse portfolio, is we can, with our supply chain the way it is, we can react very quickly
when there are pricing opportunities and the ability to take more share.
On Lidocaine, we don't really know anything new. We think based on what we know today and where the slowdowns
have been at the FDA, we've taken into account the competitive intelligence that we have. We know there are at least
three other filers, two of whom have settled for dates in 2015. And just based on our current best estimates, we think
the right approach for looking at the second half of 2014 is that it's just going to be us and the authorized generic by
Qualitest in this marketplace.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes, and Jason as you know, one of our competitors was talking a lot about it, and then
went completely radio silent. So that also seems to give us a better feeling about 2014.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Thanks, guys. Brent, when you and Paul were putting the two business together, you
talked about the revenue synergy opportunity. So I guess when can you see that? How many for could it be? And then
how do you convince investors that there is a synergy opportunity on the top line for these two businesses? And then I
have one follow-up.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. I mean I think we always said that revenue synergies are very hard to measure. I can
tell you that we do think about it quite often, particularly four weeks in as we're really starting to integrate. I think in

fairness though, you're not going to start to see the benefits of some of that until we get through a lot of the
restructuring that will happen in this quarter and the heavy lifting that will happen in the fourth quarter of this calendar
year. But I do think there are opportunities. I think as we look at driving some of the anti-depressants into the women's
health line, perhaps Linzess into gynecologists and OBs and other areas like that, there are clearly upsides. As I
mentioned, Anda looks more strategic to us as well. And I ask Bill, would you offer?
<A - William J. Meury>: No. I think that's right. I think the anti-depressant line could benefit from OB/GYN
coverage, which we were not able to provide at Forest. Clearly the Actavis GI product line is going to benefit from our
sales force capacity. We even look at a product like Rapaflo, which is going to benefit from coverage in the long-term
care segment, and so conceptually there are several steps that we're taking right now, but it's going to take a little time
to actually realize sales synergies.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. And I think I would view those all as potential upside. So I mean we're not baking
in a lot of, because they're so hard to measure, we're not baking those in. But we're going to certainly look to exploit
them everywhere we can. I think that's kind of our DNA is we're a scrappy kind of organization, so if we see an
opportunity, even a small one to do better, we're going to avail ourselves of that opportunity.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Got it. And should we continue to view Actavis as a double digit organic growth EPS
story, and so should we think about the $20 EPS number in 2017 as an organic number with the $4 billion plus in free
cash flow annually as a source of possible upside to that number?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. I think that's a fair way to think about it. I think we're absolutely committed to our
double digit EPS growth, and as I mentioned, if we reach our organic, I mean our initial 2015 forecast, on a pro forma
basis that's strong double digit growth, 25% to 35% EPS growth. So we're clearly looking at doing that. I think the $20
aspirational target could be impacted forward or backward, depending on how we deploy our cash and other strategic
actions we decide to take. And I would again go out on a limb here, but I don't think this is a group, a management
team, or an organization that will sit still for three years.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks, Brent.

Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Hi. Good morning. Brent, maybe you could clarify things a little bit. I think in your prepared
remarks, you initially referred to respiratory as one in which you're sort of under-scaled, and then you highlighted it
again as one of the opportunities in terms of blockbuster franchises and/or, but your attempt to go after franchises that
are perhaps ignored by major pharma. And that's certainly not the case with respiratory, where there are several large
competitors. Just provide some perspective in terms of how you see that franchise proceeding. Is it something you can
do with the products you have in-house, or is that going to be a target for M&A and business development to bring in
more products into the portfolio?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes, I think it's a good question. As we sit here today, right, with Daliresp and Teflaro,
we have two good products. But clearly to create the line call strategy, we need more product flow there. We do have a
LAMA/LABA that we're working through with Almirall. Now we have to add AZ into the mix to figure out how to
best advance. And so clearly we need more product for our reps to carry to create that line call atmosphere or the
economies of scale that you get from having a line call in respiratory.
The reason I said it's my least favorite of our therapeutic areas is exactly what you said, it's a highly competitive area
with lots of new products coming in. We could see some of our competitors not doing as well as they had hoped in this
space, and so it's not just a challenge for us, it's a challenge for even the really big guys. We still kind of think of
ourselves as a small company even though we're getting bigger, but we've kind of have that internal, as I said, scrappy
way of thinking about ourselves. And so look, at the end of the day we have to figure out a way to get scale in that
category. We want to be highly competitive in every area that we compete. We are on the cusp of getting there, but

we're not there yet, and so that means we have some work to do. I don't know, Bill, if you'd add anything else in
respiratory?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes, I think right now Tudorza and Daliresp are steady climbers. But as Brent said, its
sub-scale. It's a highly competitive category. We've cleared the first hurdle, which is to get into respiratory. Incumbents
clearly have an advantage. If you just take a look at the performance of Breo and Anoro, you can see it's not easy to
enter the category. And so once you're there, if you can capitalize on it, it's a real benefit. But right now we need more
products for it to make a lot of sense.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And I would just add the last thought. Staying in respiratory also has a strategic link to
our generics business. We are very focused on some very key generic respiratory programs. Clearly the goal is to get an
A/B rated version of some of these products. But if we had to go the 505(b)(2) route, having a sales forces gives us a lot
of flexibility to do things. And going back to the earlier question on revenue synergies, that would be a perfect example
of a revenue synergy if we had to go there. We just don't have any of that baked into these models because clearly the
A/B rated is the goal. But it gives us a backstop in respiratory as well. So respiratory is a little bit more strategic in the
combined activist world than it was for a standalone. But again I think if there was something better to do with our
focus, we'd certainly be willing to think about it. It's not a slam dunk that we'd just sell it or anything like that. But I
think we're very committed to being competitive.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay, great. And then just Brent, maybe if you could touch on, obviously you gave an initial
forecast for 2015 and highlighted that you'll be providing refinements as we approach the beginning of next year, which
is typically when you would have given guidance. Perhaps just provide some of the moving parts and uncertainties, or
variables if you will, that you'll be refining over the course of the year, or the things that you're most focused on in
terms of updating the guidance for next year?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes, I think there's some big things that we'll be looking. One is on the generics business.
It really relates to competition as well as the ability to approve our products. And clearly that cuts both ways because if
the FDA decides to continue to not move their backlog along and get product approved, that bodes well for our existing
products, but ultimately we'd like to see the FDA start approving things because we have a best-in-class pipeline sitting
at the FDA. So net-net it would be better for us for those things to start moving through, and so that's something we're
watching very carefully.
I think we also are going to watch how Linzess continues to respond to DTC. We've got to watch the Namenda
conversion and any potential disruption in Namenda as a key factor for 2015. And then we've got about six product
launches on the branded side of 2015 and we want to be able to invest behind those. We only get a chance to launch
each product once, and so you want to make sure you get those off to a strong start. And then I think from there, it
really is about moving as quickly as we can to get to a strong run rate on synergies in 2015 and trying to pull forward as
many actions as we can without disrupting our ability to launch and drive our pipeline in the business.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal of Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Congratulations on finally closing the deal. I've got two questions. First, just can you remind us on
respiratory, does your agreement with Almirall include access to MABA/ICS and triple therapies, or is this still
something that you'll have to negotiate? Do you have access to the Genuair device for anything other than the two
products that you have currently, the LAMA/LABA and obviously the one that you currently have, the LAMA
standalone? And then for Bill, Bill can you let us know if your current guidance reflects kind of like where you actually
completed your negotiations for 2015 with formularies? And how does that influence the mesalamines that were kind
of a sore point for a little bit, and do you expect to be able to change the trajectory of that franchise based on the
existing contracts for 2015?

<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Hey Ronny. I was going to joke with you. Which deal are you congratulating us?
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Yes, exactly.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Closing Actavis/Forest or Actavis/Furiex?
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Actually Allergan, but that's on the next call.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: That was a good comeback. Now you made me forget the question. On our deal with
Almirall, we only have rights to the device for the single agent of the LAMA/LABA combination. We have had some
discussions with them about the MABA and the triple therapy as standalone Forest and clearly we have an incredibly
strong relationship with them, with the guys in Spain, in Barcelona. We know a lot about what's going on there, and
we're excited to have AstraZeneca as a part of the partnership. As you know, we have AstraZeneca as our partner in
anti-infectives. We have a very good relationship with the team over at AstraZeneca, and so in fairness, if they had to
pick a new partner for their respiratory assets, we're favorably inclined to it being AstraZeneca because of our
experience working with them. Bill, you want to talk about the formulary?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes. Our assumptions for pricing and formulary coverage rates are based on roughly
completing all of our negotiations with CMS and Part D plans rather, for 2015. There shouldn't be any surprises,
especially as it relates to our largest Part D product of course, Namenda and Namenda XR are at the top of that list. I'd
throw Tudorza in there and Bystolic and I think we're in a pretty good position as it relates to 2015.
And then as it relates to Asacol HD and Delzicol, our focus right now is on Delzicol, which has a longer runway, and
on maintaining Asacol HD which has a high volume of sales. The promotional levels in 2015 on that product line,
again with emphasis on Delzicol, will be significantly higher than what they were in 2014. And keep in mind in the
first part of 2014, there was a great deal of disruption from a promotional standpoint and from a formulary coverage
perspective. We can fix the promotional situation, or we already have. Regaining formulary position, as you know
Ronny, takes a bit more time. I think that if you look at the performance of Delzicol, it's best right now to look at it in
terms of quarter-over-quarter as opposed to versus prior year. And I think that picture will continue to improve.
Delzicol is the only mesalamine that has both an acute and a maintenance indication, and it's also got a pediatric
indication. And there's a really nice portfolio play with the other mesalamine that we picked up when we acquired
Aptalis. And so single digit volume gains would be something nice to see over time, with price appreciation that would
reflect a mature product.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Can you talk about the key drivers, the key issues that will get you to that $20 a share in 2017?
And how do you factor in Namenda? Because obviously if we're switching everything to Namenda XR, do you assume
XR is exclusive through 2017, or do you assume there could be generic competition? Second question is Delzicol HD,
can you tell us what the timing is on that product, and what are the six launches in 2015 planned in the brand space?
Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. I think as you think about the aspirational $20, I think that the best way to think
about that, or the big drivers that affect that is clearly use of cash and strategic use of cash, which in my mind really
thinks about M&A and product opportunities. And so that would be a big driver one way or the other. I think the other
big factors are around the product profile launches of some of the late-stage products like eluxadoline, [ph] Cazavi
(57:43) and Cariprazine. And so we're working very hard to advance those and get them through the pipeline.
Another big factor that could swing is, as I mentioned earlier, is the FDA really tackling the backlog of ANDAs. We've
invested a lot of money over time in building an industry leading pipeline of ANDAs and first-to-files. We'd like see

that pay dividends in the out years that the FDA can clear some of their backlog and start approving some of these
products in a timely way. And so I think a lot of those are big factors.
As you think about Namenda XR, we clearly believe our patents go into the late 2020s. We will vigorously defend our
patents. I think we have a good alter ego to understand patent strategy inside the new Actavis. And we've already
started meeting and discussing on the best ways to defend our intellectual property. And so we believe we have some
runway with XR and that's what we have modeled.
That being said, I do think you've got to think about the Namenda franchise as a declining franchise, not a growth
franchise. I think the other leg of that stool will be the fixed dose combination of Namenda, which should launch and
give us a real possibility, depending on formulary coverage, to go after new starts. And so the combination of having a
product to go out and try to get new starts, as well as managing XR in the appropriate way, I think gives us a lot of
opportunity to keep Namenda as a slowly declining asset versus a patent cliff. And I'll turn it over to Bill for the other
thoughts.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes, the only thing I would add on XR and FDC is, over the next several quarters we're
going to be able to move a market that was three tablets twice a day to one tablet once a day. And even with pressure
on price and formulary coverage rates, we should have success in preserving some of that business.
In terms of the six product launches, two of the six are line extensions on our two largest products. Of course we have
the Bystolic fixed dose combination, which is a combination of Bystolic and valsartan. So we've taken two very
popular anti-hypertensives and combined it. Then we have the Namenda fixed dose combination. Just as a reminder,
70% of our sales for Namenda are with [ph] Ornament XR (1:00:24) or with Aricept.
We have Levosert, which is an IUD. There's only two other IUDs on the market. This product has utility in women
who have and have not had a child, and we do expect to have long-term efficacy data, which we think is an important
marketable point. [ph] Nuvessa (1:00:45) is a high dose version of Estrace, which is for vaginal atrophy. We also have
a progestin patch, which is an oral contraceptive for a special high-risk group of women. And then in 2016 we're
looking at eluxadoline, Cariprazine and Esmya, which is another asset in our women's health product line. As it relates
to Delzicol HD, we have a number of projects ongoing with Asacol and Delzicol.

Okay, our final question will come from the line of David Maris with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - David W. Maris>: The debate of inversion certainly has heated up. What's your current take on the debate? I'm
sure you're happy having done it a while ago versus contemplating that now, but what do you think the eventual
outcome will be, the timing of the outcome? How do you view that as a risk factor or as a competitive advantage? And
then separately, can you update us on the status of the key programs in the biosimilar program?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure. So, on the inversion debate, I think you wanted me to stand on a soapbox. In fact,
Paul may even want to weigh in. He's chomping at the bit here. Look, I think David, it's kind of a sad situation, right. I
think that ultimately this is about an overhaul of the U.S. tax system. And I think a lot of people get distracted by
making this a debate about rates when it's really around the global tax system or territorial tax system. As I best
understand, it's the United States and North Korea are the only countries with a global tax system, but I'm not sure
that's the company we should be keeping as a country.
So net-net what's going to happen here? What should happen is corporate tax reform. I think what likely is going to
happen is either nothing or they're going to try to do something to stop future inversions. I think doing something
retroactively becomes more difficult, and doing something that would impact us is almost impossible. Remember,
Forest and Actavis was not an inversion. The inversion occurred in 2013 with Warner Chilcott. So we are on rock solid
ground, we believe, and we have a very good structure and like our Irish heritage.

And so that's a long-winded way of saying I don't think that this Congress and what we see of our government right
now is actually going to do what they should do, which is a complete overhaul, but likely will try to do something
piecemeal to change the requirements to future inversions. That's my belief. And that would then of course embed a
competitive advantage for those companies that are already inverted, which is good for Actavis but doesn't seem like
the right thing for the country. Your second question was, David, I forget now.
<Q - Paul M. Bisaro>: Biosimilars.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Biosimilars. We have a very strong partnership with Amgen. I think it's, as I've said
earlier, now that I've had some chance to – a few weeks to look at it, it is absolutely the right partner to be doing these
programs with. If we continue to look at additional opportunities to look at biosimilars, perhaps even on our own or do
more with Amgen. But I'll turn it over maybe to Bob Stewart to add any other comments on that relationship or the
programs.
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Sure. Hi David, it's Bob. With respect to the Amgen relationship, as Brent mentioned, it's
going incredibly well. Two of our products, Avastin as well as Herceptin are advancing well through the timelines that
we had laid out. We do expect to complete Phase III of those programs within, by 2016 or in 2016, and our internal
development around our FSH program, we continue to enroll patients in our Phase III study, but the uptake in our
Phase III study has been a little slower than anticipated, which we somewhat expected based on [ph] we're still doing
(1:05:16) that, and that program continues to go successfully at this point.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Thank you very much.
Brenton L. Saunders
So I think that wraps up our call today. I would just like to conclude again by trying to convey my excitement for our
combination. Four weeks in, we have only come together as a stronger team. Our team is motivated. We're excited
about our future. We see lots of optionality for future growth, and we're absolutely focused on executing both our
synergies as well as our opportunities to drive revenue growth. We look forward to keeping you updated as we continue
to progress along our journey and our roadmap for accelerated growth and look forward to those discussions. Thank
you.
