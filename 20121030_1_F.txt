MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter Ford Fixed Income Conference Call. My name is
Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will
conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for
replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Molly Tripp, Manager, Fixed Income, Investor
Relations. And you have the floor, ma'am.
Molly Tripp
Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us today either by
phone or by webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with
us this morning and also note that our thoughts are with everyone impacted by Hurricane Sandy.
With me this morning are Michael Seneski, Ford Credit Chief Financial Officer and Neil Schloss, Ford's Vice President
and Treasurer. We also have some other members of management, who are joining us for the call today including
Stuart Rowley, Ford's Vice President and Controller; Marion Harris, Assistant Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of
Global Accounting; and George Sharp, Executive Director – Investor Relations.
Before we begin, I would like to review a few items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and slides we'll be using
today have posted on Ford Motor Company's Investor and Media website for your reference. The financial results
discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q. Additionally, the
financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP
financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as a part of the appendix to the
slide deck.
Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations about Ford's future
performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. The most significant
factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of the presentation. These risk factors and other key

information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Credit CFO, Michael Seneski. Michael?
Michael L. Seneski
Thanks, Molly. Consistent with prior quarters, today's presentation will cover Ford Credit's profit and credit loss
performance, Ford Credit funding and liquidity highlights, automotive cash, debt and liquidity and then we'll wrap
things up with a summary of the quarter.
Let's start off with Ford Credit's operating highlights on slide two. Ford Credit had another strong quarter with pre-tax
profit of $393 million and net income of $355 million. Net income includes a favorable one-time non-cash item from
the release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in South America.
Managed receivables were $87 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $2 billion from year-end 2011 and $1 billion
from the second quarter. For credit losses, we've had several consecutive quarters at or near historic lows. Third quarter
charge-offs were $35 million, down $10 million from the third quarter of 2011 and the loss-to-receivables ratio was 17
basis points.
At September 30, the allowance for credit losses or reserve was $416 million, or 48 basis points of receivables. We
paid distributions of $300 million in the third quarter and $600 million year-to-date. Managed leverage was 8.0 to 1 at
September 30, 2012 compared with 8.3 to 1 at December 31, 2011. At the end of the third quarter, our equity was $9.4
billion.
Slide three shows the $188 million decrease in third quarter pre-tax results compared with the year ago by causal factor.
The results are more than explained by fewer lease terminations, which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain, lower
financing margin, as higher yielding assets originated in prior years run off and the non-recurrence of credit loss
reserve reduction. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pre-tax profit decreased by $45 million compared with the
second quarter.
For full year 2012, Ford Credit now projects full year pre-tax profit of about $1.6 billion and total distributions to its
parent of about $600 million. For full year 2012, Ford Credit continues to project managed receivables at year-end to
be in the range of $85 million to $90 million.
Slide four shows our quarterly trends of charge-offs, loss-to-receivables ratios and credit loss reserve. Our third quarter
credit losses continue to be at or near historically low levels. Year-over-year charge-offs were down $10 million,
reflecting lower repossessions in the United States. Quarter-over-quarter charge-offs were up $18 million, reflecting
lower recoveries and higher repossessions and severities, which is consistent with historical seasonality.
Although credit loss performance continues to be in line with historical lows, we're starting to see a reduction in our
year-over-year improvement. The credit loss reserve was $416 million, down $182 million from a year ago, reflecting
primarily lower repossessions, and up $10 million from the second quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting the growth of
the portfolio.
Slide five shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. retail and lease business, which comprises about 70%
of our consumer portfolio. Over 60-day delinquencies were 18 basis points in the third quarter, up 3 basis points from
the same period a year ago. Although higher our over 60-day delinquencies are still below our historical average.
Repossessions in the third quarter were 8,000 units or 1.36% of average accounts outstanding, down 57 basis points
from the same period a year ago. Severity of $6,900 in the third quarter was up $600 from the same period a year ago,
reflecting primarily a younger portfolio as we are experiencing growth. U.S. year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter
credit loss performance is consistent with the worldwide results discussed on the prior slide.
Slide six shows the U.S. Ford and Lincoln lease residual performance. Lease returned volumes in the third quarter were
2,000 units lower than the same period last year, reflecting primarily lower lease placements in 2009. The third quarter
lease return rate was 61%, up 13 percentage points compared with the same period last year, reflecting a higher mix of

24-month contracts which typically have higher return rates than longer term contracts.
In the third quarter, our auction values for 36-month vehicles were comparable with both the same period last year and
the second quarter. Our 24-month auction values declined about $125 per unit from the second quarter. Our worldwide
net investment in operating leases was $14 billion at the end of the third quarter, up from $11.1 billion at year-end
2011.
With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.
Neil M. Schloss
Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide seven, we are largely complete with our 2012 public term funding plan with $21 billion
issued year-to-date. During the quarter, we issued $6 billion of public term funding and an additional $1 billion in
October. This includes U.S. and European unsecured debt transactions totaling about $3 billion.
Additionally, we completed over $4 billion of public asset-backed transactions which included $1.6 billion U.S. retail,
$800 million of U.S. lease and $2.1 billion of U.S. wholesale, all at improving credit spreads. We ended the quarter
with about $32 billion of committed capacity and renewed about $2 billion during the quarter.
Our liquidity remains strong and we will maintain cash balances and committed capacity that meet our business and
funding requirements through economic cycles. Also, during the quarter, DBRS upgraded our ratings to investment
grade and S&P revised its outlook to positive from stable. These are more proof points of our continued progress the
team is making with our ONE Ford plan.
Our funding strategy remains focused on diversification and we plan to continue accessing a variety of market channels
and investors. We will remain focused on maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet.
Slide eight shows the trend in funding of our managed receivables. At the end of the third quarter, managed receivables
were $87 billion. We ended the quarter with about $11 billion in cash and securitized funding was 47% of managed
receivables. At year-end 2012, we're projecting managed receivables in the range of $85 billion to $90 billion and
securitized funding is expected to represent about 48% of total managed receivables. Securitized funding as a percent
of managed receivables will continue to decline going forward
Slide nine shows our 2012 public term funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term funding programs.
Year-to-date, we have completed $21 billion of public term funding in the U.S, Canada and Europe, including about $9
billion of unsecured debt and $12 billion of securitization. Both these levels represent the low end of our projected
range for the year.
Turning to slide 10, our liquidity remains strong at almost $21 billion, down about $1 billion from the prior quarter.
Ford Credit sources of liquidity include cash, unsecured credit facilities, FCAR Asset-Backed Commercial Paper lines
and other asset-backed bank capacity. As of September 30, we had $43 billion of cash and committed liquidity sources,
down about $1 billion from the second quarter. Utilization of that liquidity totaled $17.9 billion and we ended the
quarter with gross liquidity of over $25 billion.
Capacity in excess of eligible receivables increased to $4.4 billion in the third quarter. This provides a committed
funding source for future origination and flexibility to transfer capacity among different asset classes in different
markets. We remain focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet our business and funding requirements through
economic cycles.
Slide 11 summarizes our Automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the third quarter. Automotive debt at
the end of third quarter was $14.2 billion, unchanged from the second quarter. In August, we completed the final
drawdown of low cost loans for Advanced Technologies and we began repayment of these same loans in September.
We ended the quarter with net cash of $9.9 billion and Automotive liquidity of $34.4 billion, both increased when
compared with the second quarter.

Now, let's turn and close with a summary of the third quarter. We achieved record total company and Automotive
pre-tax profits for the third quarter. Total company pre-tax operating profit was $2.2 billion and net income was $1.6
billion. Ford North America achieved its highest quarterly pre-tax profit and operating margin since at least 2000 when
we began reflecting it as a separate business unit. South America and Asia-Pacific were profitable and Europe as
expected incurred a substantial loss. Ford generated positive Automotive operating-related cash flow and ended the
period with strong liquidity. Automotive net cash was about $10 billion and liquidity was about $34 billion.
Ford Credit had another strong quarter with pre-tax profits of $393 million. Managed receivables were $87 billion at
the end of the third quarter, up $2 billion from year-end and up $1 billion from second quarter. Credit losses continued
at or near historically low levels. Year-to-date, Ford Credit has completed $21 billion in public term funding, largely
completing our public term funding plan for the year. Ford Credit's liquidity was about $21 billion for the quarter,
which is an addition to Ford's Automotive liquidity of about $34 billion. Ford Credit continued to support Ford
business with $300 million in distributions in the quarter, and $600 million year-to-date.
And with that I'll turn it back to Molly to start the Q&A session.
Molly Tripp
Thank you, Neil. With that, we'll start the question-and-answer session. Jeff, can you please have the first question?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Selle with JPMorgan.
Please proceed.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Hey, good morning. I guess just to get the elephant out of the room, Sandy, I just saw $35 billion
in damages, is there any negative on insurance or a positive on restocking that you can think of, that we should start
thinking about here? Is there anything major on either one of those?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Well, Eric, obviously there have been a number of dealers that would have – that the storm
would have been in the path of, and like with all storms, we'll evaluate. Dealers do a very good job when there is
advanced warning to try and move vehicles out of the way or get them under storage. And if there is, we'll evaluate
that. This year has not been nearly as bad as last year from storm losses, so I should have knocked on wood before this
occurred, but I don't think we'd expect it to be material.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: So, no big change. And then staying with the Finance business, has there been any changes thus
far in the fourth quarter looking at loan application trends? We had a very strong end of September. How are the loan
application trends trending thus far in the fourth quarter?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Actually, it's pretty interesting when you look at credit availability in U.S. When you look
at all the lending surveys, we're certainly seeing a greater propensity for lending. At the same time, we are not seeing a
really huge pickup particularly in sub-prime lenders or anything like that. I guess there is a still lot of customers that are
under water and are finding it difficult to take on added debt. So, although the propensity for providing credit is
improving, we're not seeing that loan demand keep up with it.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: That makes sense. That makes sense. Switching to Europe, you guys have, I think, gone in front of
the market in making steps towards the capacity which is obviously the issue and thank you guys for doing that and
getting the ball rolling over there. But looking at the – you're break even in mid-decade and then UK closing by the end
of 2013 and the Belgium at end of 2014. Is there any milestones and upcoming steps with the Labor Council that
caused concern on that timeline? Is there – do they get to come in here or is this a – do they negotiate buyouts, or is this
something that they are going to have to approve? How smooth is the process with the Labor Council?

<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Hi. This is Stuart Rowley speaking. So, as we communicated last week, our actions in
Belgium are the subject of a consultation process with the employee representatives there. And we expect that that
process to take between four and six months and that includes elements of how we will assist employees who will leave
when that business closes.
So, we don't preempt the outcome of that process, however, of course, we have communicated clearly that it is our
intent that we will shut the facility at the end of 2014. In the case of the UK, we also consult with employee
representatives, although the process is somewhat different and we have communicated that the separation of
employees in the UK will be voluntary. So, we expect to work through those items into early next year with the UK
facilities closing in 2013 and Belgium in 2014, and as a result, we've communicated we expect our breakeven level to
improve progressively as we move to mid-decade.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: That's great, that is great color. And then finally, just my final question is could you go through
specifically by region looking at Europe, North America and Asia, kind of give a review of the luxury market. I know
it's been very strong through this recovery versus the midline market, but if you can kind of speak to trends in pricing
and demand. Obviously, pricing reflective of MSRP and financing, but kind of – what do you guys feel about the
luxury market in those three regions, just kind of health wise right now with some potential weakening?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Well, thanks for that question. Obviously, we are a participant in the luxury market here in
North America with our Lincoln brand. Elsewhere in the world, we do not participate in that segment although we have
announced our plans to enter China with Lincoln and we will be doing that starting over the next 24 months or so. In
terms of pricing in the luxury segment in North America, I don't think anything unique in that segment vis-à-vis the
volume segment in which we participate. We have seen good pricing across all segments in North America. We expect
as we execute our investments in the Lincoln portfolio to have more pricing power moving forward with Lincoln in
North America, but I don't think we're particularly well placed beyond that to comment on the luxury market.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: All right. Great and once again, I appreciate the color and solid quarter guidance, really, really
good results. I appreciate your time.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Thanks, Eric.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thanks, Eric.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Jacoby with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Couple of quick ones, can you give us a rough idea on what the
cash costs could look like as a result of the restructuring actions in Europe? I know you did – I was on the call last
week and you did provide some rough idea on what it could be per an employee level and based on that, we kind of
came to a number somewhere around $850 million or so in cash costs over the next 18 to 24 months. Is that in the zone
or are we thinking about that right?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Well – thank you, Brian. It's Stuart here again. We didn't provide any specific guidance on
the cash costs although we did advise that it will be significant. And that those costs we will incur progressively
starting in fourth quarter of this year for the salary program that we have in progress through 2013 for the UK actions
and into 2014 in Belgium. The costs are significant, in excess of $100,000 per person and in excess of as opposed to
being that level, but beyond that, we haven't provided specific guidance.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. And the employee count that you provided in the press release, what I wasn't clear on is,
how much of that employee count is salaried versus the hourly? Is there a percentage or any type of number you can
give there? I mean, if you don't have it now, maybe we can get it off-line but -?

Page 6 of 8
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Well, what we've – what we did communicate is that there is specifically in progress a
program targeted at reducing our salary-related levels by about 500 people, that's primarily in the UK and Germany,
although there will be select actions elsewhere in Europe. And then in the specific three facilities, there are salaried
personnel who will be affected. We communicated there would be in total 5,700 people affected in those three
facilities. And a portion of those, although a relatively small portion, will be salaried employees who are located at the
facilities.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. And then a question related to Ford Motor Credit, just along the lines of what was asked
earlier, but can you give us, I mean, how much of the portfolio now is what you call high-risk or subprime? I mean, I
know it's pretty low but just as a rough gauge, where are we today?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yeah, we actually use those two terms, Brian, separately. High-risk obviously to us
includes more than just FICO; it's all of our internal models and how we evaluate customers and we've been very stable
at 5% to 6% for high-risk customers. Looking at subprime, which we call less than 620 FICO, again we've been very
stable there and the measure that we use for that is when we look at the amount of subprime customers who buy Ford
products, Ford Credit finances three out of every four of them and that's been very consistent. So, those are the kind of
the two book ends on how we are measuring the stability of our portfolio.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. And then last one, DOE loans, you said you're paying down some and is this something
that – I've asked this probably every quarter now for the last couple years but I'll ask it again. Can you just remind us
again what the metrics are that you look at when you decide to spend cash to either increase the dividend, spend on
CapEx, repay DOE loans, things of that nature? I mean kind of – and the priority scale how you are thinking about
those DOE loans when you're using your cash.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Well, DOE loan is quite simple. We finished drawing down on it on August 1 to the full
balance outstanding of $5.9 billion, and then beginning in September, we actually have a requirement to pay 1/40th of
it per quarter for the next ten years. So, it essentially pays off at about $150 million a quarter over the next ten years.
And that's sort of programmed now in the maturity profile. And you can actually see that – at least one year's worth in
the sort of current portion of long term debt as it will be reported in the balance sheet. So, that's a fixed number; it's at a
very low interest rate. So, the prepayment of that is something that we don't intend to do. On the more broader
question...
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: You don't intend to prepay, because I mean, I thought the goal was – maybe I'm
misunderstanding, but I thought the goal was to get $10 billion in Automotive debt by mid-decade, I would have
thought you would have to prepay that more rapidly to get to that?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: No. We ended the third quarter with $14 billion in debt and that's consistent with getting down
to $10 billion by the mid-decade, including the run-off of the DOE loans through 2022.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. All right, that's it.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Thank you, Brian.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Karson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please proceed.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Thanks, guys. I have a couple of questions, some relating to Ford Credit and some relating to
Ford. Just to get a color on the managed receivables book, I think we were at $87 billion at Q3 and I know that is
intending to grow. I think the target for year-end was $85 billion to $90 billion, so kind of roughly unchanged. Where
do you see that number two to three years out that gives us a sense as fixed income investors of kind of how much debt
you'll be bringing?

<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Well, Doug, we're still really on path for our mid-decade guidance, which says $110 billion
to $120 billion receivables, really growing along with Ford's growth and the industry growth throughout all the regions.
So, we're very excited about that. It's now – it's one of the first quarters where we're showing some substantive growth
and we're pretty excited about it. It's very good growth. It's in the retail and lease portfolios, both in Europe and North
America.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Excellent. And I'm looking at page – slide nine and it looks like we had unsecured issuance of
$9 billion year-to-date and securitizations of $12 billion. Do you have an idea, I guess, you haven't put it out yet for
2013, if we'll start seeing more unsecured issuances relative to securitizations?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: I think we have not yet come out with what our 2013 funding plan would be, but I think you
can expect it to continue on a trend of continuing to do more unsecured and less secured as we go forward to bring –
and that's both private and public – to be able to continue to bring down our sold receivables as a percent of managed
receivables. And I think that's going to continue as we strive to get a stronger and stronger investment-grade balance
sheet.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay. I guess on the balance sheet side, the Automotive cash is a good number at I think
$24.1 billion. I'd like to follow on Brian Jacoby's question about cash deployment. Have you guys thought more maybe
about further investment into the pension or if you can give us an update on that? Because it seems that you have got a
healthy excess of cash on the balance sheet.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: I think in general and I'll follow on to Bob's answer in the call this morning that was addressing
dividends specifically. I think we look at our capital strategy which includes dividends, it includes pension and the risk
associated with that. It includes our debt balance in the run down to our mid-decade target, and we continue to evaluate
those over time. To date, this, in 2012, we've put $1.5 billion of voluntary contributions into the pension fund and that's
against the $2 billion that we said we would do at the beginning of the year. So, there is another $0.5 billion of pension
contributions planned for the fourth quarter.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay. And then I'll ask one question on Europe, and I know there has been a lot of discussion
around it. And I may have missed it, but it looks like there is an 18% reduction in installed vehicle assembly capacity in
Europe on slide 10 of the presentation from a week or so ago. I'm wondering, have you guys publicly come out what
exactly is the capacity utilization in Europe right now for Ford and what will this $18 billion get you, how close to
100% will you be?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yes, I think on the call last week, we did provide some clarification around that, but we
are presently operating below 70% utilization this year and if we were to have executed the capacity reductions that we
communicated, if they were in effect to be in place this year then our utilization rate would have gone to over 80%.
Now, obviously between now and future points in time, other things will change including the industry demand and our
share and other factors, but I think that gives some guidance towards the quantum of change in today's industry.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great. All right, that's it from me. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thanks, Doug.
