David M. Cote
Morning, everyone. While we finish 2016 with a strong fourth quarter, delivering earnings per share of $1.74 and that's
up 14% year-over-year. The quality of earnings was strong, driven by double-digit growth in our UOP and Solstice
portfolios within Performance Materials and Technologies as well as continued strength in Transportation Systems and
the Home and Building Technologies Distribution business. We also funded more than $30 million in new restructuring
projects and absorbed more than $115 million in Aerospace OEM incentives.
We finished the year by exceeding the segment margin and free cash flow estimates that we provided you in December.
Segment margins for the fourth quarter expanded by 90 basis points, excluding M&A, mostly due to productivity and
benefits from significant restructuring actions we executed throughout the year.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion with 126% conversion, driven by improved working capital. For the full
year, earnings of $6.60 increased 8% year-over-year. Operationally, our segment margins improved by 80 basis points
for the year.
In 2016 we also completed several significant portfolio actions that'll deliver attractive future returns for our share
owners. The spinoff of our Resins and Chemicals business not only reduced the cyclicality and improved the margin
profile of our Performance Materials and Technologies business but it also created nearly $800 million in shareowner
value. And at today's advancing stock price, that value is $1.1 billion.
We sold our Aerospace government services business and reinvested $175 million of the proceeds into earnings
enhancing restructuring projects. We split the former Automation and Control Solutions business into two new more
nimble reporting segments that will deliver better growth, speed and productivity.
In 2016 we also funded more than $250 million in restructuring projects that'll provide a significant tailwind this year
and beyond. We also deployed more than $2 billion for share repurchases, funded high-return capital projects through
$1.1 billion of CapEx and refinanced our debt, reducing our expected 2017 interest expense by about 8% while
increasing our aggregate borrowings by $4 billion. Lastly, we successfully implemented a comprehensive CEO and
segment leadership succession plan. Darius has hit the ground running and has worked extensively with our businesses
on their 2017 operations and strategic plans.
As Darius and Tom shared during our outlook call in December, we remain optimistic about 2017 and we are
reaffirming our 2017 guidance of 6% to 10% earnings growth ex-divestitures and organic sales growth of 1% to 3%.
For the first quarter, we are initiating EPS guidance of $1.60 to $1.64, which is a 6% to 9% increase year-over-year
ex-divestitures.
I'd like to share some of our recent highlights on this next slide, which includes some great wins and progress in our
connected initiatives. Our long-cycle backlog is improving in a number of our businesses, including a double-digit
improvement in Building Solutions, driven by projects growth; a mid-single digit increase in Defense and Space, driven
by U.S. Defense; and a mid-single digit improvement in UOP, driven by increased equipment demand. We're seeing
continued strength in Intelligrated, with backlog up more than 40%, and in Transportation Systems, where our win rate
for 2016 was more than 50%.
Also, the pipeline of orders for Solstice remains above $3 billion. Significant wins in the fourth quarter include a large
utility energy service contract to modernize the Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City. The upgraded water and
HVAC systems, energy-efficient lighting and other advances will significantly reduce their carbon footprint, while
saving the Air Force more than $3.5 million a year.
UOP booked two additional licensing agreements in China. We licensed our Unicracking technology for the production
of diesel and naphtha to meet growing Chinese demand for transportation fuels. And we licensed our
methanol-to-olefins technology, which enables the conversion of domestic coal resources to ethylene and propylene,
the essential ingredients for making plastics. This is UOP's ninth MTO license in China. UOP continues to win in
China because of our local expertise, local manufacturing capabilities and our 80-year history of helping the Chinese
petroleum industry solve its toughest challenges.

Also in UOP, we announced that our modular XCeed bioreactor technology is helping a fresh-cut fruit and vegetable
company in the U.S. to treat wastewater. The unit treats roughly 150,000 gallons a day to meet local standards.
Wastewater regulations are getting increasingly strict, and we have unique technology to help our customers meet these
requirements more efficiently and cost-effectively with simple modular equipment for fast installation and low
maintenance. This is our first XCeed facility for the food and beverage industry, and growth in segments outside of oil
and gas will help reduce the cyclicality of UOP in the future.
In Home and Building Technologies, we finalized a $250 million advanced meter project with Entergy to help improve
electricity service and reliability for utility customers across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. And our HBT
business continues to make advances in high-growth regions, providing connected security solutions like a new
municipal surveillance system, and our new line of INNCOM Elements guestroom controls for hospitality customers.
We're also making significant progress on our connected initiatives, which are powered by the Honeywell Sentience
platform.
Within connected aircraft, our equipment is available for use on all Airbus platforms, and system integrations are in
process on the Boeing 737 MAX, 787 and 777X. In the business jet market Bombardier and Gulfstream will be
offering JetWave on selected models of new aircraft and we are certifying the system for aftermarket upgrades on over
30 models. We are nearing a milestone of 500 JetWave deliveries and we continue to receive significant orders. It will
be a big part of our growth story in 2017 and beyond.
We have JetWave on our planes and it is awesome. While I was live streaming a TV show on my iPad, I got a phone
call on my iPad, answered it, had no noticeable latency, completed the call and returned to the show. It is awesome,
really simply awesome.
For connected homes, we made some exciting announcements at this year's Consumer Electronics Show. We
introduced new Lyric do-it-yourself security cameras, which let homeowners monitor motion and sound while away
from their homes. We also announced the compatibility of the Lyric Home Security and Control System with Apple
HomeKit, giving homeowners control of their security system through Siri or the Apple Home app.
The ever-expanding suite of Lyric connected products now includes cameras, a water leak and freeze detector,
thermostats and security products to keep home safe and comfortable. Within connected plant, we announced new
INspire partnerships in Honeywell Process Solutions with Dover Automation and Aereon. It will help manufacturers
leverage the Industrial Internet-of-Things to improve the safety, efficiency and reliability of operations across a single
plant or several plants across an enterprise.
We currently have four partners as part of the INspire program, which fosters collaboration between customers,
equipment vendors, process licensors, consultants and Honeywell experts, and we expect that number to grow
considerably throughout the year. We also continue to gain traction for our family of cloud-based services for the oil
and gas industry, that anticipates operational complications, offering real-time solutions to overcome them. In the last
few months we've announced agreements to help PetroVietnam produce more gasoline and consume less energy, and to
help Delek Refining avoid down time and improve its operations.
Lastly a few weeks ago we announced a collaboration with Intel to develop IoT solutions for the retail industry.
Honeywell and Intel will jointly develop solutions that utilize the two companies' technology offerings, including our
sensors, handheld computers, processors, barcode scanners, RFID tags and readers and cloud-based software. These
solutions will help retailers and supply chain firms gain greater visibility into in-store inventory, enhance customer
service and ensure items ordered online are available for in-store pickup. A number of these technologies will be on
display at our Annual Investor Conference, which will take place on March 1 at the Plaza in New York City. Darius
and I look forward to talking with you more about our progress then.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.

Thanks, Dave. I'm slide four. Earnings per share of $1.74 for the quarter increased 14% from 2015, as Dave indicated.
Now this excludes the charges for debt refinancing and pension mark-to-market we talked about in our guidance. And
it also from 2015 excludes the divestitures that we did in 2016.
To reemphasize Dave's point, the double-digit increase was achieved even while absorbing the impact of $48 million in
incremental year-over-year OEM incentives. The fourth quarter reported earnings per share were $1.34. The lower
amount reflects that $0.12 for that debt refinancing and as well as the pension mark-to-market of approximately $0.28 a
share, driven by lower discount rates in UK, Germany and the U.S. The 2015 pension mark-to-market charge was about
$0.05 a share.
Segment profit for the quarter was $1.9 billion, and we expanded segment margin by 20 basis points to 19%. Now
that's 90 basis points at 19.7%, excluding the first year dilutive impacts from M&A. Productivity and restructuring
benefits along with higher catalyst and Solstice volumes were the key drivers of our margin expansion, partially offset
by the higher Aerospace OEM incentives I just mentioned.
Sales of $10 billion were flat on a reported basis and declined by 1% on a core organic basis. In PMT we delivered
double-digit core organic sales growth in UOP and in Solstice. In addition, our Transportation Systems and Home and
Building Distribution businesses continued to grow nicely. However, we did see declines in Defense & Space and
Business and General Aviation similar to what others are seeing, and we had unanticipated supply chain delays within
our Safety and Productivity Solutions business at the end of December, which modestly diluted our performance in
SPS.
Free cash flow in the quarter of $1.7 billion, up 8% with conversion of 126%, largely driven by improvement in
working capital. Our CapEx reinvestment ratio for the quarter exceeded 190% as we continued to invest in high ROI
projects. This is the third consecutive year of reinvesting at over 150% of depreciation, but we expect the reinvestment
rate to normalize to around one times depreciation as we complete this investment cycle. CapEx is expected to decrease
by about 5% in 2017. Overall, the fourth quarter was a very nice finish to the year.
I'm now on slide five to discuss the segment performance. Starting with Aerospace, our core organic sales came in at
the high end of our December outlook with softness in Business and General Aviation and prior-year program
completions at International Defense & Space leading to an overall 5% decline. Turbo continued to be a great story,
driven by our penetration in light vehicle gas applications. For the year, core organic sales in our gas business were up
more than 20% and over 30% in the fourth quarter, and we booked more than $5 billion in new platform wins, bringing
our 2016 win rate for all of TS north of 50%, as Dave indicated. Our Aerospace segment margin came in above our
forecast, driven by stronger productivity and slightly lower OEM incentives than we anticipated, but still higher
year-over-year.
Home and Building Technologies delivered 2% core organic growth led by Building Solutions, Global Distribution and
our high-growth regions, where we grew more than 10% in both China and in India. Growth in our Smart Energy
business improved, driven by smart meter program rollouts in Europe. HBT margins, excluding the first-year dilutive
impact of M&A expanded by 60 basis points, driven by benefits from previously funded restructuring and commercial
excellence, that was just partially offset by the impact of higher distribution sales in the mix.
In PMT, core organic sales grew by 5%. UOP was very strong, growing 10% in the fourth quarter, driven by catalysts,
licensing and equipment. Process Solutions finished the year with strong sales on software migration services. Now the
positive sentiment in our oil and gas businesses continues, and we see signs of improving activity with our customers
around the world, including a 5% increase in the UOP backlog, driven by equipment, engineering and services.
And fourth-quarter orders growth in HPS of 8%, driven primarily by global mega projects and the industrial thermal
business. Finally, Solstice low global warming refrigerant volumes in Fluorine Products drove 8% core organic sales
growth in Advanced Materials and we expect this trend to continue in 2017.
PMT margin expanded by more than 500 basis points, driven by those strong volumes, as well as productivity and
higher catalyst and licensing volumes in the mix. In SPS, we ended the quarter slightly below expectations, as I
mentioned earlier. Intelligrated continues to perform quite well, its order rates have been strong, increasing by double

digits in calendar year 2016. And the business is exceeding its income targets despite the acquisition and integration
costs we've incurred. SPS segment margin expanded 100 basis points, excluding the first year dilutive impact of M&A.
This was driven by benefits from restructuring and commercial excellence.
Slide six shows the elements that contributed to our EPS growth in the quarter. This was a quarter of strong earnings
growth, driven principally by the performance in our business segments. Starting on the left, earnings per share for the
fourth quarter of 2015 was $1.53 if you exclude last year's pension mark-to-market charge and the fourth quarter [ph]
2000 – (17:26) earnings associated with the 2016 divestitures.
Operational segment profit reflects our core business performance, so it excludes non-operational impacts such as
one-time M&A costs, the dilutive impacts from the strengthened U.S. dollar and incremental OEM incentives.
Operational segment profit was the big driver, contributing $0.19 to earnings. Our continued productivity across the
portfolio, the increased volumes, most notably from UOP and Solstice, the operating earnings from the nine
acquisitions we've completed since 2015 and the benefits from restructuring we continue to fund are all fueling the
operational improvement.
All other is a $0.02 tailwind and includes benefits from below-the-line items, a slightly lower share count and a lower
tax rate, partially offset by the non-operational components of segment profit I mentioned. This works to earnings of
$1.74 per share a 14% increase, our strongest quarter of 2016.
Let's turn to slide seven to quickly recap our full-year performance. Our full-year sales increased 2% on a reported
basis. For the year, we had good growth in Home and Building Distribution, global gas platforms within Transportation
Systems, the commercial aviation aftermarket in Aerospace and in our Solstice business in Performance Materials and
Technologies. You can see a summary of our segment performance on the right of this slide. And more details about
our segment's fourth quarter and full-year sales performance are in the appendix.
Segment margins expanded by 10 basis points, excluding the dilutive first year impact of M&A, driven by productivity
and restructuring benefits, partially offset by higher Aerospace OEM incentives and the unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange. Now the incremental year-over-year Aerospace OEM incentives diluted our segment margin by 50 basis
points in 2016. As you'll recall, this turns into a slight tailwind in 2017.
The results of all this were earnings of $6.60, up 8% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $4.4 billion was slightly better
than we previewed in December, driven by better working capital performance.
So with 2016 now behind us, let's take a quick look at some market trends we are seeing as we head into 2017. I'm on
slide eight. In our oil and gas businesses, the positive trends we started to see at the end of the third quarter continued to
evolve. UOP orders were up more than 30% from the first half to the second half and all of our UOP businesses
contributed to a strong book to bill ratio of 1.04 in 2016. UOP project activity is improving and a number of projects
that were on hold, particularly in China, are restarting. We see good momentum in our high-growth regions driven by
the demand for refined product in China and India's accelerated transition to the Euro 6 emission standards.
Domestically, our modular gas processing orders picked up in 2016 and we expect that to continue in 2017.
The activity in our international gas processing business continues to be slow, although the pipeline is encouraging. We
see similar encouraging trends in process solutions. While the pipeline of new megaprojects continue to be lumpy,
there have recently been expansions of previous awards and startups of awards that were on hold from prior years. The
activity in our short cycle and software businesses, so in advanced solutions, lifecycle solutions and services businesses
should continue to improve as our customers resume spend in small and mid-sized projects. And on a regional basis,
activity in the U.S., China, and Russia remains positive.
We're also starting to see signs of improvement in our Defense & Space portfolio, including 7% growth in our backlog
and increased activity in our U.S. core Defense business. However, there is continued softness, albeit moderating, in
our commercial helicopters and domestic space businesses, consistent with what others are experiencing. Our plan
continues to assume that the U.S. DOD continuing resolution is in place through April. For the year, we expect Defense
& Space to be roughly flat on a core organic basis versus 2016.

Regarding construction, while commentators have been expecting a slowdown in growth rates in 2017, recent
indicators have been more positive. The U.S. Dodge Momentum Index has risen for three consecutive months, reaching
a new high in December, with a surge in commercial planning intentions. Nevertheless, we continue to plan
conservatively in this space and continue to forecast low single-digit growth in residential and commercial
construction, leading to low to mid single-digit growth in HBT.
In Aerospace, we expect the weakness in the business jet market will persist over 2017. This is most prominent on the
OEM side and our outlook here has not changed. In the aftermarket, the number of engine maintenance events is down.
This will drive variation in growth quarter-to-quarter. But for the full year, we expect aftermarket revenue to be in line
with flight hours as our accelerated growth in connectivity solutions and repairs, modifications and upgrades provides
offsetting momentum.
Regarding currency, as you know, most of our exposure in the euro is hedged at $1.15 and we have selectively hedged
other currencies as well, thanks to this hedging approach. There's no change to our EPS outlook despite the stronger
U.S. dollar compared to the assumptions we had in our outlook call.
Currency headwinds, however, will bring down our full year reported sales outlook by about 1.5% and our revised
guidance is now $38.6 billion to $39.5 billion in 2017 sales. The reduction is solely due to the foreign exchange I just
mentioned. So on an overall basis, the markets we serve are largely unchanged from what we said in December and
we'll continue to monitor this as we move through the first quarter.
Let me move to slide 9 with a preview of Q1. For total Honeywell, we're expecting first quarter earnings per share of
$1.60 to $1.64. That's up 6% to 9% year-over-year, excluding from 2016 the earnings associated with our 2016
divestitures, which was about $0.05 in the first quarter.
Sales are expected to be between $9.2 billion and $9.4 billion, which is flat to up 2% on an organic basis, or down 2%
to 4% reported. The difference between the reported and core organic sales is due to the divestitures and the impact of
foreign exchange, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, primarily Intelligrated. Segment margins are expected
to expand by 50 basis points to 80 basis points. We expect that the sales in the second half of 2017 will be stronger than
the first half. PMT and HBT will have a steady quarterly progression as they have in recent years.
The differences between first and second half are more pronounced in Aerospace and Safety and Productivity
Solutions, but we have good visibility to the acceleration. For example, in Aerospace, in the first half of the year, we
expect higher year-over-year OEM incentives, which as you know, impacts the top line, but we expect that trend to
reverse in the second half. The decrease will drive a 1% incremental growth for Aerospace in the second half of the
year. In addition, we anticipate Aerospace aftermarket will be stronger in the second half due to increased sales, repairs,
modifications and upgrades, including further growth of connected aircraft offerings.
In Transportation Systems, we also have second half growth acceleration. This is driven by scheduled new launches
and the lapping of a large program completion that will negatively impact sales in the first three quarters of 2017.
In Safety and Productivity Solutions, our second half is expected to be stronger, as Intelligrated reaches the one-year
point in our portfolio in September and its growth is then included as organic.
In the Safety business, we expect positive impacts of a stronger oil and gas industry and are already beginning to see
small signs of improvement, including increased bookings in gas detection and personal protection equipment and
increasing activity from distribution partners in the Gulf. Lastly, we have significant new products launching in the
Productivity business in the spring, including mobile printers and computers.
For the full year, our guidance assumes a tax rate of approximately 25%, which is slightly higher than the full year
2016. The tax rate is based on an assumed level of employee stock option exercises and any change in that exercise rate
could impact the tax rate. We'll update you on that as we progress through the quarter. Our first quarter guide assumes a
weighted average share count of approximately 772 million shares.
In Aerospace, first quarter sales are expected be down on a reported basis primarily due to divestiture of the Aerospace
government services business. The strong deliveries to our air transport OE customers for newer platforms are expected

to continue, driven by the 737, A320 and A350, but will be offset by declines in legacy platforms as we previewed in
December.
Additionally, sales in business and general aviation will be down and aftermarket sales are expected to be slightly up.
Defense & Space will also be slightly up, driven by growth in our U.S. core Defense business, partially outside by
declines in International Defense, U.S. Space and commercial helos.
Finally, in turbo, the strong growth we experienced in 2016 will continue, building on continued platform wins in gas
and diesel. Light vehicle gas will continue to be the main driver, while we expect a slight improvement in commercial
vehicles, following a strong fourth quarter there. Aerospace margins are expected to expand by 40 basis points to 70
basis points, driven primarily by productivity, repositioning benefits and the effects to our foreign exchange hedging
strategy, partially offset by the unfavorable mix of new versus legacy platform deliveries.
HBT sales are expected to be up 1% to 3%, driven by new product introductions, including the Lyric launches that
Dave highlighted, as well as Elster smart meter programs and another quarter of double-digit growth in China,
primarily driven by our air and water business. Our high-growth region strategy and [ph] One China (27:56)
organization continue to serve us very well in this regard.
In Distribution, we expect to see continued conversion of backlog in the Energy business and Building Solutions, and
strengthen global distribution, which continues to outgrow its markets and peers. We anticipate HBT margins will
expand by 130 basis points to 160 basis points, driven by improving volumes in the products business, commercial
excellence and the benefits from our 2016 restructuring action.
In PMT, sales are expected to be up 3% to 5% on an organic basis, or down 10% to 12% on a reported basis due to the
spin-off of the Resins and Chemicals business. We expect strong orders and sales growth throughout the PMT
portfolio, as I mentioned earlier. The segment margin expansion will be driven by productivity and the impact of the
spin-off. PMT continues to execute very well on their productivity initiatives.
In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we expect that organic sales will be down 1% to up 1%, or up 19% to 21% on a
reported basis, including the Intelligrated acquisition. The Safety business is expected be up slightly in the first quarter,
driven by new product introductions in both the industrial safety and retail footwear businesses, improving orders in the
industrial vertical overall and improvement in our supply chain.
The Productivity business is expected to be flat to slightly down, driven by continued retail market softness that is
impacting demand for scanners and mobile computers. That being said, we are seeing significant orders growth in our
supply chain related business, particularly in our voice-enabled Connected Worker solutions and we expect to clear the
supply chain challenges we faced in the fourth quarter.
In addition, double-digit growth in Intelligrated is expected to continue. We are confident that our investments in
connected retail solutions, coupled with Intelligrated warehouse automation solutions, are positioning the business for
long-term growth. SPF segment margins are expected be up more than 150 basis points, excluding the first year dilutive
impacts of M&A, driven primarily by the impact of productivity and restructuring benefits.
Let me move to slide 10, where we're reaffirming our 2017 earnings and organic sales guidance and have updated the
year-over-year figures to reflect the 2016 actual results.
From a total Honeywell perspective, we expect sales in the range of $38.6 billion to $39.5 billion, up 1% to 3% on a
core organic basis. Reported sales growth will be lower in the range of flat to down 2% primarily due to the impact of
foreign exchange and the divestitures we completed in 2016. As I indicated earlier, the difference in 2017 sales from
our outlook call is solely related to our FX assumptions.
Segment margins are expected to be 19% to 19.4%, or up 70 basis points to 110 basis points versus 2016. Earnings per
share expected to be between $6.85 and $7.10 or 6% to 10% growth versus 2016. The quarterly linearity for EPS
remains roughly in line with prior years. Free cash flow forecast remains in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion
that's up 5% to 7% from 2016.

On the right side of the page, we've updated our segment guidance to reflect the impact of final 2016 results on the
variances and updated foreign currency impact in each business on the sales line. Otherwise, there are no changes to the
outlook from December.
As I said earlier, our tax rate maybe more volatile quarter-to-quarter depending on the number of employee stock
options that are exercised. Our guidance assumes an approximate 25% tax rate at present, slightly higher than last year.
Let's turn to slide 11, to sum up, we finished 2016 strongly. 14% earnings growth, 8% free cash flow growth in the
fourth quarter and 8% earnings growth for the full year. We reaffirmed our 2017 outlook and expect first quarter EPS
to be up 6% to 9% excluding divestitures. We've put together an incredible 2017 plan under Darius' leadership that
continue to deliver significant value to our shareholders, our customers and our employees.
With that Mark, let's turn it over to Q&A.

Thanks, Tom. Dave, Darius and Tom are here to answer your questions. So, Tamara, if we could, let's open the line for

Thank you. We will take our first question from Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Dave, is this your last conference call?
<A - David M. Cote>: It is. This is the last one and I can promise you, I'm really going to miss it.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Well...
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, that wasn't a joke. I was serious.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: It's good for everybody, right? Well, you will be missed. But I'm sure Darius will do a great job.
Anyways...
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: I'm looking for it.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Well, we know where you live, if he doesn't do a good job. Let's put it that way. So...
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, you do now.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yeah. So look, I have a nitpicky question, this JetWave thing. Is this – sounds interesting, for
sure, and you've talked about it for the couple of years. It's not brand new, but is this more of a – just new platforms or
can you do a rip and replace and get rid of some of the existing slow Wi-Fi that's out there with GoGo?
<A - David M. Cote>: You can absolutely retrofit and that's one of the comments that I had made because we're in that
process and I think as consumers start to see what's possible when you are using this JetWave service, they're going to
be demanding it. I mean, it really is stellar. I was on the plane. I wanted to test all the stuff myself. My guy – I've given
all the guys a hard time by going faster. So I started live streaming a show. It worked perfectly. I got a phone call
through the iPad, while I was watching the show, answered the phone almost – in fact, I noticed no latency in the call at
all. And then when I ended the call, the show resumed exactly where I'd left off. It was quite impressive.

<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I'd add to that that. I'd add Scott that we have over 1,000 aircraft that are committed
to JetWave. We've got over 20 airline wins to-date. It's a selectable on the Airbus. We've been certified on the
platforms that we mentioned earlier. We're working with Boeing to get certified, as we said. So it looks pretty good.
The growth is very strong double digits for us in 2017.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: So how does the profitability on this stuff work? I mean, are you going – I assume this is some
sort of monthly charge, but when do you start making money on something like JetWave? Is it a couple years of
investment and then it really starts to kick in or on day one are you shipping out units that are profitable?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, we make money now.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Is that a monthly charge, Dave, or is it – how does it work?
<A - David M. Cote>: It's going to vary on some of the – depending on the segment. So I don't know, if we've shared
all that on the business model but it'll vary between large planes and biz jets.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, but to be clear, Scott, I mean there is a significant amount of equipment that goes
along with this, which is [ph] sell and install (35:40) model for us. So that is also helping the growth and creates that
profitability for us immediately.
<A - David M. Cote>: This is a good one.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Good. That's why I ask. Good luck, guys. Thanks.
<A - David M. Cote>: Scott? Scott?
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yes? Yes.
<A - David M. Cote>: Before you go, I will always remember that you were our first supporter back in those dark days
when I first got here. So that's not something I'll forget and I was obviously pleased that we could prove you correct for
the 15 years but thank you for that.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: You're quite welcome. I was pretty – I got lucky. That's all. But best of luck. Thanks, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: It was a bold move at the time and I appreciate it.

<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: First of all, congrats to Scott for getting the call right early. It's been a good one for him,
so congratulations to him. First question, what TV show were you watching?
<A - David M. Cote>: It was The Americans. I don't know if you see it but I'm only in the first season, so don't tell me
anything.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Glad to see you're still working hard out there. So...
<A - David M. Cote>: I got to test the system. You don't want me flying the plane.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: I can picture Darius in the same jet just doing something different on his iPad. So just a
question on tax. Can you maybe just talk about what the dynamics are around how, if repatriation comes through,
border adjustments, just give us some color on your kind of net export position? If the Brady Bill does go through, I'm

Page 10 of 20
sure you guys have done some analysis, what should we expect?
<A - David M. Cote>: We're a net exporter, so on balance, it would benefit us from a tax standpoint. When it comes to
repatriation, it depends on what the final deal is if there's a really high tax rate that's put on it, well, that makes it a lot
less interesting. So we'll have to judge it when we see it.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: And again, how much – if it was a very low rate on repatriation, I mean, would you be
able to do something pretty quickly?
<A - David M. Cote>: Sure.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: There's going to be some latency between when something's enacted and there's some work
that we have to do on earnings and profit studies but it's nothing that's...
<A - David M. Cote>: It doesn't take years.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No, not at all.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Right. Okay. And then just kind of an annual run rate on Intelligrated. Just kind of back
of the envelope I'm getting something for this year kind of close to – you've given us the first eight months contribution
getting something close to about $1.1 billion. Is that around the right number? And what was the annual revenue that it
finished out in 2016 for Intelligrated?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I mean, it's a little bit less than that, I mean, around $900 million is what we would
call the annual run rate but it is growing at that 20% clip. So you can see that it could get pretty quickly to the numbers
you mentioned, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So the $900 million is kind of where it's growing today in – for 2016?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I'd say that's an annual run rate that we can work off of.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And the margin there was relatively low this quarter. I think it was kind of low
single digits. How do you kind of see that margin? I know it's not going to be one of your best margin businesses here
in the near term but what's kind of the trajectory of getting that to at least a double-digit range? I know it's a growth
story. I'm just curious as to when the contribution really picks up.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I mean, as you can appreciate, the first year is always a tough one for M&A
particularly one of that size. So that's why we've referenced those lower margin rates but when those first year charges
go away as well as when the synergies kick in, we'll be low double-digit kind of margin rates.
The interesting thing though is that the installed base that we built really gives us a platform for other offerings,
particularly on the software side and that's one of the main reasons we bought the business is to be in the supply chain
and distribution arena from a technology perspective, that's going to help that margin rate as well.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Great. And then one last quick one. Dave and Darius, at the March investor
meeting, I think Dave you're still going to be around for that one. How prominent of a role will Darius play as far as
presentation? And what should we expect to hear in March from Darius?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, they made room for my walker, so I should be just fine. Darius?
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: I think we just kind of laid out – in the finalization of laying out the agenda, but you should
expect me to do a majority of the presentations that Dave normally does. Obviously Dave will have a role at the
beginning of the conference, but the expectation should be that I'll be leading most of the presentations that Dave led in
the past.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Well, then I'll save the congratulations and farewells for then. Thanks a lot.

We will take our next question from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. Thanks and good morning all. I'm glad everyone is in such good spirits.
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I got to tell you, Steve, I really enjoyed your headline this morning. It's always nice to
wrap up on a good quarter.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: You're the best, Dave. I can always count on you. Listen, I want to go back to the
meetings that we had in December when you and Darius talked about, you used the word animal spirits a lot and maybe
best describer of what you were seeing globally with your customer base. Could you maybe – it's been a month or so
since then, a month and a half, how has that changed?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say it's changed to become more positive. I've really been impressed to see that
improvement in animal spirits, small company CEOs, big company CEOs, small banks that I've talked to, really quite
surprising. So the animal spirits are real. There's no doubt about it. And hopefully if we can just get a few sparks here
with some actual actions, it could be enough to really start to turn the herd. I don't think it takes us crazy levels of GDP
growth. If it did, that would be a problem, but I think we are going to see an improvement here, not ready to bet on it.
We're going to continue to plan for a slow growth global economy, but it still feels more positive than it has in a while
coming off of well, the worst recession since the Great Depression.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: Just to maybe add one other comment to that. I certainly would agree with Dave's
commentary regards what we're seeing. Maybe the one offset to that and I think our clarity sooner rather than later
would be particularly helpful would be on a lot of the discussions and that's really what they are at the moment, are
discussion around trade policies as they relate to both Mexico, China, and some of the other trade partners that we
have. So I think in our view the sooner that gets cleared up and resolved, I actually think there could be a further uptick.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Great. You guys talked in your main comments about – your prepared comments about
safety and productivity and some of the issues there. But a little more color would be helpful on the supply chain,
especially in terms of these things that – those issues are reversing? Do you expect this thing to get back to normal or is
some sense of timing around that, a little bit more color would be helpful there.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: Yeah, sure. It really goes around some of the issues were primarily around some of our
voice and product lines, essentially it was due to a supplier issue due to a transition. We do expect those issues to be
cleared up in Q1 and right now we're seeing a recovery plan that's in place, so it did impact us. Think about an impact
in the tens of millions of dollars, not hundreds. But nevertheless, it had a meaningful impact to our Q4 and we expect a
full recovery in Q1.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And just, if I could, Solstice, the big backlog, how do you see that? I think you
said $3 billion. How do you see that playing – or how do you see that sequencing out over the next few years?
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: Well, we see it, obviously, accelerating this year and continue next year, as particularly with
all the European new cars having Solstice in them or a competitive offering and then a further acceleration in the U.S.
So we continue to seek tailwinds for that product as we move forward and continue to expect a double-digit growth rate
both in 2017 as well as we head into 2018 and beyond.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And sorry, just quickly on Steve's question and you said you were a net exporter
on tax. You guys report $5.5 billion, I think, on gross export. So there have been some guesses out there. Could you
just put a finer point on the size of the imports just to give folks some idea of the order of magnitude here in the delta?

We will take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thank you and good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Jeff.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Hey, Dave. Feel a little nostalgic, this is the last call, we'll see you in March. But good
work, congrats.
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, thanks and I was going to wait till the end of the call, but you were – while you took some
convincing you were also an early supporter and I'll not forget that either.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: All right. Well, you put it up. That's great. By the way, I was guessing you might have
been watching Celebrity Apprentice to try to get a read on who the next president could be, No?
<A - David M. Cote>: I think they already had that argument six or seven years ago. So I think you still got to be a
citizen, I mean, born here.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Hey, just a couple of questions. Can you and perhaps it's Tom, but just put a finer point
on anything we should know on the timing of Aero OE incentives quarterly in 2017, just to kind of avoid any confusion
or surprises to the extent that you do have visibility on timing?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, the way I'd characterize it, Jeff, is overall, it's a modest tailwind for the year and –
but the first half will be different than the second half. In the first half it's actually a headwind as we talked about for
the first quarter. That does moderate in the second half to result that overall modest impact year-over-year. I'm talking
less than $50 million or so on that.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Okay. And then I'm sorry if I missed it in the kind of the preamble, but also a finer point
on commercial aero aftermarket if you could, large OE versus business jet and kind of what – how flight hours tracked
for you in the quarter?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I mean, we expect in 2017 to be – on the aftermarket side to be largely in line with
flight hours on the air transport side. And that shows up in both the spares as well as the repair and overhaul businesses.
I would say that there is a somewhat of a shift into the newer platforms that we've talked about with the extensive
buildups on both air transport and business jet side and that changes the installed base, the character of the installed
base. It freshens it, it has more units under warranty. So particularly on the business jet side that can have a timing
impact while you are still under warranty in some of the new platforms. So we'll also, on the business jet side,
hopefully track the flight hours, but you could see some – a little bit of a softness as a result of that factor I explained.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: What's the actual performance in Q4, Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Actual performance overall on the business jet side was low single-digit for both the spares
and the [ph] R&Os (49:17).
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: And then finally, just I would imagine the pension funding took a nice repair here at the
end of the year, it was in pretty good shape anyhow. But is pension funding kind of off the table for you guys in the
foreseeable future?

<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I would say that we continue to have obligations on the international side. We have a
number of plans. I mentioned, Germany and the U.K. are some bigger ones and there's modest contribution required
there, but for the big U.S. plan, it's in pretty good shape. We see no funding requirements for the foreseeable future.

And our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - David M. Cote>: Howard, how are you doing?
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: I'm all right, Dave. You've always watched head count and you've always been
conservative in your forecast and there's a little bit of have-to in your numbers. How have you gone back to the
business units and made sure that there's some real confidence in that? I mean, sometimes you have short-cycle
businesses and some, there's obviously backlog, but what have you done to test your managers?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I'll turn the bulk of the question over to Darius but what do you mean by have-to?
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Well, the second half of the year is where you expect a bit more of the performance than
in the first half.
<A - David M. Cote>: Okay. Well, Aero incentive is playing to that, as Tom mentioned, then just comparisons.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Yes. Exactly. And I mean...
<A - David M. Cote>: It's not that – it's not like it's a ramp-up or anything like that but you have to – you've got to
have a – you've got to believe in. So it's not that big a deal, actually, but Darius spent a lot of time on 2017 plan with
the businesses. So I'll turn it over to Darius.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: Yeah. No, I think, as always, we plan and invest cautiously, so I think we certainly plan
some investments, particularly in the front end of the business, in terms of sales and marketing and R&D but we're
certainly not going to spend all of that in the first quarter. Because sometimes you can certainly get ahead of yourselves
and we're going to be monitoring to see if the growth is coming in and whether or not we can afford to make those
investments and they're going to be phased throughout the years with triggers that will align with the kind of growth
that we're seeing. So this is not a situation where we're going to kind of spend the full investment budgets in Q1 and
then hoping that things happen. It's just not the way we operate and won't now either.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: No, I understand but what are you doing in terms of head count for the year? You're
planning a modest increase or you're planning on keeping that relatively stable?
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: All in all, given the restructuring activities that we have planned, we think those are going to
be stable.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah. We are definitely adding on the commercial side, I mean, across the portfolio, in
Aerospace PMT and other places, we are adding head count, both in developed regions as well as high-growth regions.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: And then just to add and I think you're going to also see a mix change because – particularly
in the former ACS organization but really, throughout. We took out couple layers of management to increase
organizational speed and decrease bureaucracy and we took some of that money that we saved and reinvested it back
up, particularly in the sales forces.

<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: And then one last question sort of talking about expansion in general and sort of two parts
to it. One is, you fixed a big chunk of your debt going forward. Is the reason you still have the amount of CP
outstanding, you're anticipating some benefit from cash that you can repatriate? And how are you thinking about deals
for the year? I know it's always – Dave reminds us every time, it's all about timing and that's not predictable but within
that context, can you talk about possibly some of the areas you'd like to enhance?
<A - David M. Cote>: I'll turn it over to Tom. But right now CP is cheap and we're well covered with our credit line,
so it just makes sense to use it that way and we do. And you're correct. You foretold the answer on acquisitions, it
depends on what becomes available and is it at a price that we're willing to pay. And Darius is not New Hampshire
cheap, but he is cheap. So he's going to be the – I don't know what adjective he wants to put on it, but so you're not
going to see a diminution in discipline here.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: Yeah. I would echo what Dave said on the debt that's outstanding. Dave used the word
cheap, I would say CP is actually profitable and I'll just kind of leave it at that. But – we do have an extra amount of
cash on the balance sheet because of that and we're trying to maintain some flexibility to the extent opportunities come
up as Dave said. So it's a good time to be taking advantage of that.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you.
<A - David M. Cote>: [ph] You good? (54:53)
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: Yeah. [indiscernible] (54:54) so I think just to reinforce what Dave said, it's certainly going
to be cheap. Probably the other word I would use is selective. And really do our, as we always have done, real diligence
around what does that end market look like? What are its growth prospects? What is the competitive environment?
What it's going to evolve to? What are the disruptive technologies? We're going to be spending – we always have and
we're going to be spending even more time on those elements to make sure that these – our M&A strategy continues to
be highly accurate, highly predictable. And we're in line with our financial objectives.
<A - David M. Cote>: And, Howard, I suppose that before you go, I should add, I'll always have great memories of
going to Red Sox games with you. But I'll also remember that you blew me off at a meeting at TRW, and I just wanted
to make sure I publicly stated it.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Yes, but there was a cheesecake that was made up in homage for that, if you remember.

growth engine for you. And then also secondly, there's been a lot of Tweets around Defense pricing having to come
down. And so what – how do you guys feel your position there as well?
<A - David M. Cote>: From – to echo what Darius said earlier, yeah, you have to be worried about a trade war. If it
gets to that point, it's not going to be bad just for trade but it's going to be bad economically. It's kind of tough to be in
economic island now, especially if you're the number-one economy in the world. So it depends on how all that gets
handled. And yeah, of course, it's a concern for us. On the Defense side, most of our stuff – you've heard me say this in
the past, but Defense is more of a sales channel for us. There's very little that we do where it's just a single product
solely for defense. It tends to just be another channel for us. So a lot of our stuff is already just done on a commercial
pricing basis, and I think that kind of mitigates any potential impact for us.
<Q - Joe Ritchie>: Got it. So you're not – go ahead. Go ahead, Darius.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: Yeah, just to add to that, I mean, I think, obviously, there are a lot of the discussion and I
would put it very much in a form of discussion and kind of back-and-forth, it is a obvious concern because I think any
kind of trade disputes, particularly as it relates to Mexico and China, which are two of our key trading partners would
be a detriment not just to Honeywell but to the broader economies. But firstly, I remain optimistic and I think that this
is going to get resolved in a manner, which is constructive for all parties involved. And right now, we don't have
anything definitive anyway other than pure speculation. So we do remain optimistic that it will evolve that way.
<Q - Joe Ritchie>: Okay.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: And just to – Joe, just to add to Dave's point on the Defense side. Many of our positions are
not directly with the government. We're working with the primes. I mean we're not a prime, and so they're very good at
negotiating with us. And we have commercial arrangements with them, as Dave said. And for the platforms that are
getting all the attention recently, I mean we're very well aware of what's going on. I mean we've been on ongoing –
even well before this, of commitments around cost with primes that we serve as our primary customer. So don't want to
dismiss the concerns, but it's something we're accustomed to. It's an environment that we're – that we've operated in for
years and we expect it to continue.
<Q - Joe Ritchie>: Got it. No, that's good to hear. And I guess maybe as a – as my follow-on question, it was nice to
see the cash flow come through this quarter and fully recognize that – 2017 appears to be a little bit of a transition year
on the cash flow. Maybe kind of talk us through again, kind of what's driving the kind of 2-point difference between
your cash flow growth and earnings growth in 2017? And then what's kind of the framework to think about 2018 and
beyond for cash flow?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I mean, it's been an interesting year for us as far as cash has been concerned. I mean
we're – clearly had some headwinds in the markets that we serve. And the conversion in the first couple of quarters was
not what we wanted. But in the third and particularly in the fourth quarter, with a continued focus particularly on
working capital, we were able to get that conversion that you saw that was north of 100%. Overall for the year, 86%,
we think that will improve as we head into 2017. That's going to come from better working capital performance and it's
not just in our supply chain and inventories but we have opportunities in receivables and in payables, so we're working
all of those areas, as well the CapEx that we've talked about, begins to moderate in 2017. And that moderation
accelerates into 2018. So if we go from $1.1 billion, which is that – the re-investment ratio we talked about over 150%,
we moderate that down to 110% or 105% or 100% by 2018 that gives us a nice boost as well to free cash flow, so that
should enable the conversion to continue to improve from 2017 into 2018.
<Q - Joe Ritchie>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for going long on the call. So, Dave, just I would love any
thoughts you have on the pick-up we saw in December. I mean, we've seen this pick-up across the board. Obviously,
the pro-business spiel we're hearing from D.C. is encouraging but the quickness of the turn-up has been surprising. So
I'm just wondering, do you think it's just the absence of uncertainties that we have regarding presidential election,
Brexit, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? Do you think it's oil and gas? I mean, what do you think has caused all this
pick-up?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I do think – and I've said this for several years that I don't think economists also really
understand what happens after a severe financial recession. It was true in the 1930s and it was true of this one and the
hit to overall confidence was just really, really strong, really hard. A and when you have the whole herd thinking about
slow global growth and that's just the way it is and that's just the way it's going to work, well it becomes
self-reinforcing because we all act that way. If you take a look at the conditions for recovery, it's actually been pretty
good for a while.
I mean, we've been talking for a number of years about how good consumer balance sheets were in the U.S. You look
at capacity utilization. It's in good shape. Unemployment down 4.5% or so. You can argue underemployment but still
employment's in good shape. Bank balance sheet in the best condition they've ever been. Most companies' balance
sheets, really good shape. And I really think it just needed a spark. And the election, assuming that we – that the right
things get followed through and we don't end up with some unintended consequences, provides that spark. And I'm
really encouraged by what I'm seeing. Now it's got to turn into something but right now the feelings are better than I've
seen them in a long time and that could be enough to get the herd moving in the direction of saying I better not miss
this moment as opposed to, gee, just hunker down and keep waiting it out. And that's not a simple short explanation but
I think that's probably the case overall.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: No, it's great and I appreciate the color. And then just turning back to SPS and obviously it's been a
challenging 2016 as per the plan. But obviously we haven't had perfect transparency on this business in the past. You
have large projects and inventory channel headwinds and obviously, the supply chain issues you called out. Are these
part and parcel of – is this the nature of the beast or was 2016 just sort of a perfect storm of bad events? Any sense on
that you can give us?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I think this is more a – we view 2015 or 2016 as much more of an anomaly, than
kind of the status quo. I think we have enough – a confluence of events which were all kind of came together wrong
time. Number one is, obviously, we talked a lot about the USPS contract and that conversion. Number two is we had
that channel inventory issue that had to work its way through.
Three is, and this was more timing related than anything else. There was a shortage of larger deals that are notable,
because some of this business goes through distribution and some of it goes direct. And those direct deals were few and
far between, not just for us but really a lot of our top competitors as well.
And then four is I think we, personally, I think we have room for improving some of our channel programs, et cetera.
So we do expect this business to very much return to its performance that it's enjoyed for many, many years and view
2016 as an anomaly.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And the channel inventories, are they at a level now where you're comfortable with sell-in
equals sell-out?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, I think most of that has been resolved with one exception, but I would say 70%, 80% of
the challenge is behind us.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Right. And then just finally for Tom, you called out in the PR that interest expense 8% below 2016
levels. I mean, obviously, I can do the math, but it implies the interest expense close to the $300 million for 2017, a bit
below what we had. That is the right number?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: It sounds about right. Yeah.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Great. Thanks, Tom.

And our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Some of your business jet customers have continued to cut production during 4Q. You
obviously didn't change your 2017 guidance in Aero. So my question is how much visibility have you had to these
production cuts? And when you think about your overall negative 2% to 1% organic forecast for 2017 in Aero, do you
have a decent contingency for more business jet business already in your guidance and if some stabilization in U.S.
Defense or commercial helos is something you're expecting and maybe could represent a tailwind to your guidance?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I mean, first starting with the business jet, we, for sure, have the production
schedules for the platforms that we're on with the large OEMs. We've actually been more conservative than we're – had
taken a conservative approach in the second half when we were putting together the 2017 plan. So some of the cuts
that, actually, you're referring to, we most likely had contemplated in the guide that we gave you. So we're not – I don't
think we're going to be caught off guard necessarily by what you're now seeing and hearing and reading.
On the commercial helo, that's a space that, as you know, is heavily dependent on oil and gas. And for us the declines
over 2016 were just reflective of what was going on in the market. I think we're going to still see some tepid conditions.
I don't foresee growth for 2017 that you would consider very significant, if at all. But as the sentiment starts to improve
in oil and gas, as we articulated in the prepared comments, we do hope that that will turn into some benefits. And you're
already seeing some of the OEMs report on the helos side, some modest improvements. So hopefully that's a sign of
things to come. We haven't built much of it into our plan is the way to think about it.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Okay. That's helpful, Tom. And then we know that you've had more – I mean, you will
have more difficult comparisons as the year goes on in PMT, especially late in the year but Solstice should continue to
ramp. You told us what UOP backlog is. It's good, up 5%. [ph] Keeping all the present (1:08:40) just really remains
steady, I would surmise that UOP should continue to be solid or improve. So why would sales growth drop from the
3% to 5% you're guiding to in 1Q as you go through the rest of the year? Again, is it just that you need to be
conservative [ph] because (1:08:55) it's a pretty short-cycle business, is that sort of the way to think about it?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I think we'll take it quarter by quarter. We are seeing, as we said, a pretty strong backlog in
UOP, and hopefully the orders that materialize in the quarter will contribute to that further growth. We're not trying to
signal any sudden demise between first quarter and the rest of the year for that business.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: All right. Thanks, guys.

<A - David M. Cote>: Well, for a variety of reasons I'm not sorry. I don't think – John, you were – well, you took a
little longer to convince, you were also an early supporter. So thank you.
<Q - John G. Inch>: You're welcome. I wasn't that far behind Davis but you're right. You know it takes me a little
longer to kind of get moving in the morning. I'm trying to figure out how to top that trade wars question. Maybe I
should ask you what you think of asteroids, but I'll leave that one for Darius.
Hey, Safety was down 5% on the core, and the reason I ask this, 3M's Personal Safety business was actually really
good and that company actually called out some selective pricing actions to try and stimulate some volume. Are you
seeing anything competitively in that dynamic other than just the market? That's my first question.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I don't think so, John. I mean, the – I would say the growth rate that you mentioned, the
mid-single digit decline, was largely the result of the supply chain challenges that we had. And I think we would've
been in line with the market otherwise. And as Darius said, January – that gives us a nice boost for January and when
we get those issues behind us.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah, that's fine. Just big picture, you guys are obviously not a beta company, which makes you
an investable company. But if the economy continues to percolate and let's just hypothetically say your shares lag, what
are your thoughts about really starting to leverage up the balance sheet and buy your stock, if the market is not willing
to comply, at least in the short run?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, certainly that's been something that we contemplate, we've talked about our
approach, which the foundation is to keep the share count flat with – through buybacks, and to opportunistically go
after further buybacks as the market conditions look attractive. In the fourth quarter, we did about 2 million shares of
buyback which is more than we normally would. And what I would say is that we're going to continue on that
approach. I mean, we do have a little bit of a restricter in terms of where our cash is located. You know that most of the
cash is overseas, so we can't just take $9 billion of our overseas cash and put it into buybacks, I mean, it's not – just not
practical.
Should circumstances change around the new administration and tax policy and so forth, we'd obviously take a look at
it. But right now our existing approach is to keep that share count flat and look for opportunities for displacement of the
market to accelerate where warranted.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: I think overall, John, the approach will be similar to what it's been. So we're going to be
opportunistic in terms of those buybacks. And if the tax environment does change and that transaction to bring that cash
from overseas becomes a bit more frictionless, we're going to review that. And we're going to review it primarily two
different things. We're already committed to growing our dividends at a rate, which is faster than EPS, so we said that.
You know about our CapEx profile, which is going to be elevated this year and then start tapering off. So basically it
comes down to an investment in either buybacks or M&A. And a lot of that has to do with timing and market
conditions and what we see, and what's available but that's kind of a rough framework as to how to think about the
trade-offs?
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah, it makes sense. I mean, Darius, obviously there's a lot of perspective that part of your
mandate is going to be to try and move Honeywell's growth higher, which you probably can't do, you can do some of it
organically, but it's going to require some M&A and some of these software deals. You did greater than Intelligrated,
but some of the stuff is pretty pricey, especially the market up. I mean, do you have a bias in the short run just given the
run? Is it – let's just assume that cash was frictionless, you didn't have these repatriation issues, would you be preferring
deals over share repurchase right now or is it unclear?
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: It's really not that clear because it all depends what deals are out there and what kind of
prices. So it's hard to say I'm definitely going to prefer one over the other. And I think in terms of – yeah, I mean, I
certainly hope to enhance our growth rate through some of the portfolio work that we have been doing, and will
continue to do. But I will also – there's a flip, the other side of the coin here, which is I think we've got to continue to
maintain our discipline around what we pay and, granted, some of the higher growth assets usually require higher
multiples. But I think if we can – if we do our homework right and look real hard, and I think Intelligrated is a good

example of that, I think there's still an opportunity to buy assets and buy companies at attractive prices.
<Q - John G. Inch>: I also think you got some damn good organic growth efforts going.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: Yeah.
<A - David M. Cote>: I don't quite buy the premise, John, our organic growth is what it is.
<A - Darius Adamczyk>: Yeah. And a lot of the self-help here that we're doing around our newly launched
commercial excellence, our [ph] DPG (1:15:02) efforts, which we're spending a lot of time as a company. So I think it
really is a combination between what I call self-help and continuing to have work on our portfolio like we've done over
the last – especially over the last 18 months.

And our next question is from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hi, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: So, Dave, congratulations and thank you. And Darius, look forward to your hosting in
the call going forward. So question on top line and margin. It seems that top line was impacted by the FX and you have
taken up margin relative to December 14. Looking at the index, looking at the Bloomberg Currency Index, it seems
pretty flat from a month ago, so just wondering what particular currency is driving it. And the second, just looking at
high-margin guidance by segment, how much of it is just FX and is there any self-help built into this high-margin
versus a month ago?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah. Andrew, when you go back to our guidance, I mean, we were pretty clear on the FX
assumptions that we use for 2017. Our normal process is to update the FX rates at the end of the year. And so when we
do that, you end up with that – the impact, mostly due to – if we had used, for example, $1.10 our planning rate for the
euro, we change that to $1.05 that has an impact. The bottom line, though, is that the organic growth rates do not
change. We're calling 1% to 3%, the EPS still stays the same at that 6% to 10% growth and the cash conversion
remains the same. So it's a matter of just picking the number and finalizing it as is our normal process.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: And on the margin question?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah. I mean, the change in the margin is solely due to lower sales in the same segment
profit dollars...
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Got you. No. Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: ...because as you know, our hedging approach keeps our segment margin protected.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: And then a question on China, they had a big stimulus last spring, you guys, at your trip
this summer, you did a very good job sort of highlighting the fact that there is a lot more growth in China than the
Street was thinking at the same time. We're sort of starting to see it in the numbers. Given that the Party Congress is in
the fall, how much juice do you think there is in this growth beyond 2017? And how concerned are you guys as to sort
of growth decelerating into the second half of 2017 in China?
<A - David M. Cote>: It's kind of tough to predict exactly what's going to happen to China economically to your point
especially with their, I guess, quote, elections coming up. But I'd say overall we're still long-term believers in China, so
whether they have a lower growth year than what they've had in the past, at the end of the day, our prospects there are

That will conclude today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Dave Cote for any additional or
closing remarks.
David M. Cote
Thanks. After 15 years at the helm, this is my last earnings call as some of you pointed out. It's been an honor to lead
the Honeywell team for this many years and all of us are proud of what we've accomplished. I'll have to say we're even
more excited about what's coming. Our outperformance will continue because we've invested heavily in people, process
and portfolio, to do the seed planting that we've always done. We do well today not just because of what we are doing
today but also because of what we did three and five years ago. That outperformance will continue on to Darius. He is
just as driven as I am and he's smarter. We have many, many terrific years ahead of us.
This is an exciting time to be part of Honeywell and you'll all benefit from it. Now while it is a bittersweet moment or
time for me because it would be fun to continue running Honeywell in these great years to come, it's worth a little time
to also focus on the sweet side of it. Next weekend we will again celebrate that quintessential American holiday, the
Super Bowl. And in that celebration, it's important to remember that we are all patriots. Please join me in supporting
and celebrating America's team. Thanks.
