I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams. Mr. Williams, you may begin.
Robert L. Williams
Thanks, Regina. With me today are Michael Dell, Brian Gladden and Steve Felice. During the Q4 earnings call, we
discussed our initiatives to create a more streamlined and efficient earnings process. Effectively, we are reducing
prepared comments and increasing the content in the web deck. The web deck, along with our DellShares vLog, are
posted to our website in advance of the call and I encourage you to review these for additional perspective.
Next I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are
forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, which are

Now I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Rob. While we continue to make strong progress in the transformation of the company, our first quarter results
were mixed and we fell short of our own expectations. There were some areas where our execution was not as
expected. And there were also some market dynamics that created some headwinds for us. We want to be clear that we
remain committed to our strategy, and we want to acknowledge that our progress will not always be linear.
Our commitment to build a broader set of end-to-end solutions and shift the mix of our business continues to be our top
priority. And we're making progress. Our mix of Enterprise Solutions and Services is now 50% of our margin and 31%
of our revenue. Dell-owned IP storage, which is a key component of our Enterprise Solutions and an area where we've
made significant investment, grew at 24%. And we've announced five and closed three acquisitions year-to-date, all of
which will help drive higher value mix and more predictable revenue and margin streams going forward.
Specifically, the acquisitions of SonicWALL and AppAssure further enhanced our portfolio of Dell Security and
Software Solutions.
For the quarter we delivered revenue of $14.4 billion, down 4%. This was below our outlook. There are a few key
causes to the shortfall. Our sales execution was not up to our expectations and we've made changes to improve this as
we head into the second quarter. Additionally, the demand environment was tougher than we had planned. And I'd
specifically highlight weaker demand in markets like EMEA and parts of Asia in addition to public markets.
Finally, we're seeing a more challenging competitive environment in a few areas of the business. We'll address these
items in more detail in a moment.
I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward. Our gross margin was 22%, up 30 basis points sequentially.
While we saw improved Enterprise Solutions and Services margins and mix and a sequential business shift from
consumer to commercial, margins were impacted by a tougher pricing environment in client products.
OpEx was down $183 million sequentially, driven by one less week in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter
combined with reductions in G&A and sales compensation. Operating income was $1 billion or 7% of revenue. Cash
flow from operations was a negative $138 million. While Q1 is normally a seasonal low for cash flow, the sequential
revenue decline coupled with the 14th week in Q4, negatively impacted our accounts payable balance in the quarter.
Our trailing 12-month cash flow from operations was $4.9 billion, up 17%. We allocated $300 million of capital to
repurchase 17 million shares of Dell stock, and ended the quarter with $17.2 billion in cash and investments.
Turning to our lines of business, Servers and Networking grew by 2% as we saw the typical pause in Server purchases
ahead of the launch of our next generation servers. Initial demand for the products is tracking ahead of our plans and
the pipeline is strong heading into the second quarter. We're seeing good traction in our networking business, as
PowerConnect revenue was up 46% year-over-year and Force 10 increased 69% sequentially. Dell IP storage was up
24%, to $423 million, as the Compellent pipeline continues to strengthen and EqualLogic grew at 14%. Total Storage
declined 8% as third party storage now represents less than 5% of our Storage business.
Our notebook business contracted 10% as we saw a more aggressive competitive environment, particularly in the entry
level and emerging markets. We believe some of the tougher competitive environment can be attributed to channel

inventory rebuilding, following the hard disk issues of the past two quarters. In addition, we're seeing more consumer
IT spending diverted to alternative mobile computing devices. These dynamics impacted both our revenue and margins
for the quarter. In the short term, we believe our Client business is well positioned on cost, and we'll focus our efforts
on growth on higher margin, higher value segments with a priority on profit over unit share.
The Services business continues to be a highlight. The business grew 4% to $2.1 billion, driven by 8% growth in
support and deployment. The Security business was up 31%, driven by our SecureWorks acquisition. Operating
margins are up, as we continue to improve our cost structure and increase our attach rates of Premium Support and
Deployment Services. Revenue for our Software and Peripheral business declined 7% for the quarter to $2.4 billion.
Consistent with our prior commentary, this continues to be an area where we'll see pruning of the non-strategic
elements of the portfolio.
Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to mention that at the beginning of the fiscal year, we realigned some customers
between business units with the biggest impact in SMB and Consumer. The details behind this change are included in
Slide 19 in the web deck and the tables in our press release.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve.
Stephen J. Felice
Thanks, Brian. Before I get into the results by business unit, I want to provide a more detailed view of factors which
impacted Q1 results, as well as some proof points supporting progress in our transformation. We believe these changes
will position us for long-term success.
Let's start with sales force productivity, where execution was below our expectations and impacted our Q1 results. As
you all know, we took action last year to accelerate our transformation by hiring sales specialists to focus on our
Enterprise business solutions. While we have seen progress here, we still have more to do to improve our sales
execution.
Exiting the quarter we've made some modifications to our selling model that will improve results going forward. First
of all, we've moved sales resources to better optimize coverage within specific customer sets, and geographies. In
addition to that, we're increasing our focus on integrated solution offerings rather than over specializing on specific
products and emphasizing a strong focus on our server, storage and notebook products. We implemented many of these
changes headed into Q2 as we substantially completed the consolidation of our global sales and marketing
organizations. We're confident these actions will improve our sales execution as we move through the year.
Now looking externally, the environment remains challenging. Consumer spending on desktops and notebooks
continues to be under pressure and much of the growth in Consumer has migrated to entry-level products and emerging
markets, where we've chosen not to participate. We're also seeing some IT spending prioritized to purchase other
mobile devices. This is mostly a consumer dynamic, but there is clearly some impact in areas of Commercial as well.
Growth markets were flat despite growth in China of 9%. We navigated these emerging markets more cautiously in Q1,
and we're optimizing for profit given the economic uncertainty.
There are also many positive indicators that our strategy to deliver converged and easy to manage solutions to our
customers is gaining traction. Our Enterprise Solutions and Services growth excluding EMC was 5%, and several
products are growing at rates faster than the market. We're also seeing a strong response to our next generation servers.
The mix of these servers was over 25% exiting the quarter. We're seeing strong momentum in many of our acquired
technologies, like Compellent and Force 10, where we've added almost 1,000 new customers doing the quarter. And
our Service business continues to show strength and is building a good pipeline, and signing new business that should
position us well going forward. Our new signings for the trailing 12 months was $1.8 billion, which is up almost 80%,
and our Services backlog was up 9%.
Now I'd like to turn to our business unit results. Large Enterprise revenue was down 3% driven by developed markets,
which declined 6%. We see a good pipeline here, but some customers are delaying their IT spending. Public continues

to see spending pressure and was down 4%. We are starting to see improvements in the U.S. Federal spending, but our
K-12 and Healthcare businesses were lower than expected. SMB revenue was up 4%, driven by Enterprise Service and
Solution growth of 17%. SMB continues to be a solid business for us, given our scalable solutions focus and strong
relationships with these customers. The growth was broad based geographically as all three regions grew, which was
led by APJ up 10%.
In total for these three Commercial businesses, we saw gross margins increase sequentially, and overall operating
income was at 9.3%. The Consumer business was our biggest challenge in the quarter, with consumer notebook
revenue down 15%, as we limited our participation in the profit-challenged entry-level systems. On the channel front,
we expanded to over 103,000 channel partners in Q1. These partners are becoming increasingly important, as we
provide a broader set of converged solutions on a global basis.
And finally, we're confident that we are positioning ourselves well for profitable growth and we believe the recent
changes we've made in our global go to market processes and organization model will position us better for execution
in the coming quarters.
Now I'll turn it back over to Brian to discuss the outlook.
Brian T. Gladden
Thank you, Steve.
Despite the good progress we're making with our Enterprise Solutions and Services, our overall revenue performance
wasn't where it needed to be in the first quarter. As Steve said, we're confident that we have action plans in place to fix
our execution and improve our top-line growth, as we move through the year.
In addition, the investments we've made position us well as we strengthen our execution. While we believe spending
has been delayed in some areas, we have a healthy pipeline of business and expect to gain growth momentum as the
year progresses. We do have concerns about the impact of the competitive pricing environment. We'll continue to
monitor these dynamics and adjust our tactics to optimize operating income and cash flow for the company, based on
how the market plays out. While we're not off to the start we expected for the year, it's too early in the year to adjust
our FY 2013 EPS outlook. We intend to provide an update on the total year outlook during our second quarter earnings
call in August. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in line with normal seasonality of a sequential increase
of 2% to 4%, mostly driven by our public business seasonality.
Before we take questions, let me close with a few summary points. We're fully committed to our strategy and will
continue to make investments in building end-to-end solutions capability. This is a long-term strategy and will take
time. We're making progress and have several areas where our results are strong proof points that our strategy's
working. And we look forward to providing a more detailed strategic update at our upcoming investor analyst meeting
in three weeks.
Now let me turn it back over to Rob.
Robert L. Williams
Thanks, Brian. Just a quick reminder to limit your questions to one with one follow-up. Regina, can we have the first
question?

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: Yeah, thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the revenue guidance. What gives
you confidence in the up 2% to 4% sequentially, in front of a major operating system release? Wouldn't we expect to
see some pause from both consumer and corporate customers ahead of that?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Chris. I think – look, we're building off of the first quarter run rate. I think to some
extent we've seen some of that pause that's already in the run rate. A lot of the sequential improvement really is driven
by the typical public, state, local business and educational really dynamics. We look at the pipeline there and that looks
like it supports that increase.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: And just to follow up, I wanted to understand the gross margin pressures in the Client
business a bit more. It appears margins in Clients were flat to down sequentially, despite the alleviation of the HDD
issue and I would imagine the curtailment of losses last quarter from exiting the handset business. I guess the question
here is, what's wrong with your cost structure? Why can't you compete in this marketplace and benefit from some of
those tail winds?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I would talk in general about gross margins and say, we did see some good progress in
the quarter in terms of mix, Enterprise Solutions and Services, obviously higher margin. Services margins were up in
the quarter sequentially. Both of those things were good. HDD issues, generally worked through the quarter and we've
gotten supply, so that's generally behind us. Commodity inflation, deflation was about what we expected. There was
slight deflation in the quarter. But the thing that we would call out was really the notebook pricing dynamics that we
saw in the quarter and some mix within notebooks. So not going to provide a detailed walk of that in terms of
quantifying it, but that's sort of what we're seeing going on within gross margins.
Steve, you want to?
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: So the one thing I would add, that I feel was a little bit different than the last couple of
quarters was the competitive dynamics in Asia. That's where we saw a pretty heavy price competitive dynamic and we
backed off. You saw our growth slowdown there. We feel like we're in good cost position overall. There are certain
price bands where we don't participate as strongly in and those lower priced products moved pretty heavily throughout
China and Asia.
We also feel like there was a bit of a channel sell-in that took place. So there was a lot of competing for shelf space that
we didn't think was healthy. So that put some margin pressure on. So I think we're going to watch this carefully over
the next quarter. But I don't think what we saw in the first quarter is really something that's sustainable at an
industry-wide level.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Hey. Thanks a lot. What are these changes you're making in your go-to-market strategy
that could help sales? Could you give us more detail? And when will they kick in and in what segment? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: I'll take that. First, let me say that we're trying to move as quickly as possible in this
transformation. And in trying to accelerate the transformation, it requires a level of complexity in adding a number of
specialists, in figuring out where the right coverage models are and in figuring out the right solutions that we choose to
sell. And so the changes are refinements. As we put this business together this quarter, we noticed we got out of
position in a couple of areas. One is, I'm not going get specific on which customer sets, but we found ourselves lacking
coverage in certain customer sets that we normally excel in. And so we are reallocating resources. A lot of that
happened in Q1. It's going to continue in Q2, probably for the next few quarters. But we've got a lot of that underway.

A second change is really simplifying the bundling of solutions. So I mentioned this in my comments. With all of the
new capability, we were tending to sell things on a single-product basis as opposed to a more bundled solution. It was
spreading our resources a bit too thin, and not taking advantage of the true solution capability that we have. So we've
done a better job coming out of the gate this quarter in having smarter bundles that take advantage of the core products
we have in Server, Storage and Notebooks but build around them the terrific IP that we've acquired in a number of the
acquisitions we've done.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. And then my follow-up was, with regard to Windows 8 and Romley, it sounds
like Servers are off to a good start. If you could be more specific, how much is due to the Romley cycle and what are
your expectations for Windows 8? And when does that kick in, too, if we follow the sequential improvement pattern?
Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yeah, this is Michael. We're seeing, I think, very good initial demand for our 12th generation
PowerEdge. And we were first to market with those products and feel the product line is incredibly strong. We exited
the quarter with the 12th generation being a little over 25% of the Server business. So it's off to a strong start. I think
the benefits of this generation in terms of 10-gig Ethernet and all the performance characteristics and the larger memory
footprints going into bigger workloads, give us lots of opportunity to grow that. We're also seeing strong adoption of
our networking architecture with that as well.
As Steve mentioned, we're kind of changing the sale here from Server to convert sale of Server, Storage, Networking,
and kind of Software and Services that go around that to support it. Windows 8, obviously, we're totally lined up
around the launch of Windows 8. We don't see – corporations are still adopting Windows 7, so we don't think there will
be a massive adoption of Windows 8 by corporations early on. But certainly the addition of capacitive touch capability
into Windows 8, we think will be a welcome addition and we'll have a full complement of products at time of launch.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Brian, given the high DSOs this quarter, does that suggest that the
weakness was relatively concentrated in April? And if that's the case, what have you seen in May that gives you
confidence that the business will look pretty normal seasonally in the July quarter?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Katy, I think April was not what we expected. We had kind of come into the quarter
and seen a bit of a lull in the first couple months and were looking at pipelines that were pretty strong for April that
really just didn't materialize and saw some things specifically push. We feel, as we sit here today, the pipelines look
pretty good. We talked about that in the comments, heading into the second quarter. And that gives us some confidence
that we would expect to see the sequential improvement that we would normally expect.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: And then just a follow up as it relates to Dell's strategy to react to the competitive pricing
environment. Can you continue to walk away from that competitively priced business? Or at some point do you need to
go after the volume to adjust the cost structure that you're sitting with today?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, look, I think it's clearly isolated to a couple markets and a couple places within the
business, mostly consumer. Steve can talk a little bit more about it. I think we've been focused on mid-price, higher
price kind of products, higher value segments for a while. I think we'll continue to do that. There are parts of the
business where that will force us probably to walk away and prune more revenue than we probably thought coming into
the year given the dynamics that we're seeing.
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Yeah, the price bands of the products that are attractive to us still make up half the market. In
some parts of the world, they make up two-thirds of the market. And so there's going be a time where the compares are
going to not include a lot of low-end product that we're not emphasizing.

For example, in this past quarter, our XPS line sold very well. It was up 33%. But it's still a smaller portion of our total.
But it's growing in mix on a regular basis. And so at some point, we think that line will be the predominant line for us.
We analyze the cost structure all the time. And like I said earlier, we think we're in good cost position. I remember a
few years ago, people hitting us with the same thing when Acer was pushing hard, and we said we were going be
disciplined because we didn't think they could sustain what they were doing and we saw what happened to them. So
we're not going to overreact in one quarter. We'll continue to look at the pricing dynamics and our cost structure. And
we'll make sure we're competitive in the areas we want to be competitive.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. If you stand back and just think about what the Client business delivered
this quarter, revenue growth was down 6% year-over-year. It was down 10% in notebooks. Your margins were
materially pressured and you have to walk away from a bunch of business. That feels like a pretty sobering market and
market situation. I'd like you to comment on whether the PC market is evolving in a less attractive way than you had
thought one or two years ago and what you think about is realistically the normalized revenue growth for the market in
Clients and what the normalized revenue growth we should think about for Dell? I would presume it would be lower
given that you have said that you may want to continue to walk away from parts of the market.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Toni, I think to be honest, if you go back a couple years, the growth in the PC market
has clearly been lower than what we would have expected a couple years ago. And as we talked about on the call,
clearly some of that is alternative mobile devices that I would argue is a relatively new dynamic affecting the business
over that period of time.
That said, I mean, again, as Steve said, there are still opportunities for us to find growth here. We see it as an attractive
business that's still generating very good margins for us. And we think we can continue to do that. There will be some
pruning that continues in that business as we focus on higher profit parts of the business.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: I know when talking to the commercial customers we still don't see in even the midterm, any
material change in their strategies other than maybe virtual desktops, which the acquisition of Wyse positions us well in
that area. But where we play strongly in, there's still an indication from the customers that they continue to stay on the
course they're on. And our biz client products are very profitable. I think we really probably should limit that more on
the consumer side, where we did see a lot more margin pressure and a lot more operating income pressure. But the
business client product side of the business was very healthy. That's more of a near-term growth issue and we do see
that being more acute than systemic.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Toni, I think in terms of framing up longer-term view of end user computing, I think we'll
spend a fair amount of time doing that, as we head into the analyst meeting.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And as a follow up, I was wondering if you could comment on the forces at work on both
operating expense and principally components going forward over the next couple of quarters? Clearly in OpEx, you're
going be adding some higher gross margin, but higher OpEx businesses in the form of your recent acquisitions. Should
we be expecting OpEx to continue to go up? Or do you feel you have in dollar terms or in percentage of revenue terms,
or do you feel you have plans to offset that? And similarly on the component side, I can't help thinking that if you
believe that HDDs have largely come into supply balance and DRAM pricing looks like it's more likely to go up than
down, should we be thinking about pressure on your total BOM [Bill of Materials] going forward over the next couple
of quarters?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, just to talk about OpEx, Toni, I think we've been pretty disciplined in terms of how
we're managing that. And you look at this quarter in terms of the demand environment and what happened to revenue,

we were pretty disciplined in terms of managing through that. We are still shifting dollars and making investments in
important parts of the business, R&D spending is up and that will continue. Some of the sales investments will
probably moderate in this environment, as we make some of these changes. But I think what I would say is, you can
count on us to continue to be disciplined in how we manage OpEx without giving a specific outlook on that.
In terms of component pricing, I think it's a mixed bag. It's – we've expected, as I think we said in the first quarter – or
the end of the fourth quarter, that memory and displays would probably be increasing in the second half of the year. I
think we still believe that. Our outlook would have memory increasing in the second quarter and the third quarter and
probably coming back down in the fourth, and displays similar. As we've also talked about, hard disks we would expect
to start seeing some deflation as we move throughout the year, so not a lot of change in our outlook in terms of
component prices. I would tell you in aggregate probably a little more favorable for the year than what we would have
expected three months ago, if you put all that together.

<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Yes. Back to the sales execution, what gives you the confidence that this isn't just the
market not embracing Dell Solutions versus this being sales execution related? I guess I don't understand how you're
lacking coverage in certain areas, given all the hiring you've done, I think it's been thousands of sales specialists. I
would think coverage is going up, not down? And I'm just trying to get a sense for how confident you are and how
much you think you have your arms around the situation? And again, what pace of improvement are you expecting?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, actually I'm very confident in this question, in our ability to sell solutions because
really what I would say, if we look back this past quarter, I think where we stumbled a little bit on execution, was on
transactional selling. The solutions selling was strong. We probably – I don't have an exact number, but just looking at
what happened during the quarter, the number of offers we had that included servers and storage and networking and
services, was up quite a bit.
When I talk about the coverage, I think we over-indexed a little bit on where we put all the specialists, in other words,
too many geographies. We had – we probably saturated a place and then left some places uncovered. Same thing with
certain customer sets, so we're balancing that. We've added quite a bit of capability and we just have refining to do, as
we roll that out. But the actual ability to sell solutions is improving as each quarter goes by.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay. And then, Brian, I guess why not reduce the full year EPS outlook given the
disappointing Q1, the tough pricing environment, which could linger and the sales execution changes that sound like
they're going to take time to play out? It seems like you need to generate 80% of your EPS in the next three quarters,
which is higher than what you've done in the past?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, look, I think based on the quarter there's clearly pressure to the total year outlook. For
us to get to the outlook it's going to require improved sales execution. It will probably require a bit of market
improvement in the second half, but that's what most of the industry forecasts would say right now. We'll need better
revenue growth and good discipline around costs and gross margins. But I think, Brian, we'd like to see the demand
environment and our execution as we head through the second quarter before we give an update for the total year.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Great. Okay. Thanks.

<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. Given the pricing environment you referenced, should we assume that
end-market pricing is going to pressure the gross margin profile in the July quarter? And I understand you don't give
specific targets there, but if you could just help us qualitatively? And related to that, are you seeing any signs of pricing
aggression outside of the Client business?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, when you put the pieces together, Bill, clearly the Enterprise Solutions and Services
growing at a faster rate is creating a positive mix dynamic for the company. And I think we would build a view for the
rest of the year that assumes that's going to happen and continues to provide some tailwind on gross margins. We think
that should generally offset any pricing pressure and how we manage profit in that Client business versus units, I think
we can do that. So that's a qualitative view as you think about that. What was your second question, Bill?
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Are you seeing any signs of pricing aggression outside of the Client business?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I think most of the pricing pressure we saw was focused in consumer within the Client
business and specifically in the emerging countries.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. A question on cash flow, how should we think about both cash flow
and cash usage during fiscal 2013, especially given the weakness this quarter and the acquisitions that you're going be
closing in fiscal second quarter? Just how are you thinking about cash?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes. No, I think the cash P&L continues to look good. We had challenges obviously with the
working capital dynamic in the quarter and coming off the 14th week from the fourth quarter that affected first quarter
cash flow. I think we continue to feel that we'll have a strong cash flow year. We will continue to commit to the 10% to
30% investment in terms of share buyback for the year. And we feel confident that we have cash flow to support the
M&A transactions as well.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. And then I'm not sure if Michael or Steve wants to take this, but can you talk a little
bit about your tablet strategy given the pressures you're seeing in Consumer with regard to tablet? How are you
thinking about tablets? Any change to sort of your timeframe or expectations?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: We're totally lined up with Windows 8. You'll see us introduce tablets contemporaneous with
the Windows 8 launch.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: And that's still on track in terms of timing?
<A - Michael S. Dell>: It's on track for Microsoft's launch, yes.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yes. Thanks, guys. Most of my questions have been asked, but looking at the product gross
margin line, 19.2% from 19.4%, I know that we talked about PC gross margins being down moderately on a sequential
basis, can you help us understand how we should think about product gross margins in the context of both the PC side
of the division as well as the ongoing mix shift in the Enterprise? Do we maintain a mid-30% implied gross margin on
Enterprise is what I'm trying to get at as well as the implied 15% or 16% PC gross margin?

<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, I think it goes back to our overall strategy clearly, Aaron, will drive faster growth in
the higher margin Enterprise part of the business. There are still areas where we're building scale in some of the
acquired assets. You should see gross margins continue to expand there. I think as we move through some of the next
generation products here, we would also expect some of those Enterprise Solutions to have higher margins. So we
would expect that that will ultimately rise as we introduce those products and expand that business and grow it faster.
On the client side, I think, to be honest, we feel we're in a good cost position. And we feel like we're in a place where
we can manage that for profit. And that's how we'll do that. That's how we'll run that part of the business.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: And then as a follow up on the storage side, you basically have now anniversaried your
acquisition of Compellent. How do we think about that as you've fully effectively as well burnt off the EMC side of the
business there? How do we think about the growth in that division as the comps start to get a little tougher on a
year-over-year basis?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well. I think they get tougher but they get easier, too. I mean we had in the quarter, a total of
less than $25 million of EMC revenue. So for all intents and purposes I think we've burnt through the headwind
associated with that for the total storage measurement for all of the Storage business. So we would expect to see
continued strong growth, double-digit growth clearly in Compellent and the EqualLogic businesses as we move
forward. And over the next couple quarters, I think that will translate into the total Storage business growing at double
digits.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yeah, we're seeing a strong pipeline in Storage and feel very good about the product line that
we have there.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Okay. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Brian Marshall with ISI Group.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks. Brian, with respect to the three reasons you cited for the revenue
disappointment in the April quarter, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more in terms of granularity with
respect to how much was associated with kind of walking away from low margin business. With the revenue
disappointment I would assume that if that were a significant portion of it, we would actually see margins a little bit
better than 7% on a pro forma operating basis? And then I have a follow-up as well.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Brian, I think there were really two areas where we would talk about pruning
activities in the quarter. Clearly in the Software Peripherals business that was down 7% in the quarter, as we've said a
couple times that's probably the biggest area where you'll continue to see us do that. Some of that, to be honest, is as we
acquire IP and build our own intellectual property, there are parts of that business where we want to sell our own stuff
that's going have much higher margins. There are other parts of the business that will continue to be unattractive in the
grand scale of the overall portfolio that we'll continue to shrink.
I think the second one is really in the Consumer business. You think about the overall growth that we saw there, or the
lack of growth was really driven by us making conscious decisions not to participate in business. So I would isolate
those two areas in terms of the big impact on revenue.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Okay. And then with respect to the pace of M&A going forward, is it safe to assume that we
should expect that to slow down a little bit here? And if so, kind of the similar size deals going forward? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, not really going to provide an outlook in terms of M&A activity. As you think about
over the last three years, we've had a relatively steady pace of activity there. And I think that's clearly one of the
elements of our growth strategy will be to continue to do that. But we feel good about the five that we announced in the
quarter. And we've closed three of those thus far; we have two more. And we think they are very good and additive to
the portfolio.

We'll take our next question from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you. A question for Brian really about the second half of the year. I appreciate
you're not providing full year guidance any more. But I mean, just at a high level maybe Michael could speak about
half-over-half drivers. I get the Server business seeing a refresh. You guys don't seem too convinced about Windows 8
having a meaningful impact immediately, at least this fiscal year. Is there an impact of acquisitions that you're counting
on? I'm just trying to understand what can really change the second half, apart from a better macro and Server business
to you guys. Many thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I think the combined impact of the five acquisitions that we've announced is relatively
small. For the total year it probably contributes in the order of 1% growth in revenue. That clearly, assuming we can
close the deals, will happen and contribute. The Server business, we should see a pickup as a result of the launch of the
next-generation products and would expect to see that moving through the second quarter. I think other than that,
clearly there's – Windows 8 dynamic but that's much more of a Consumer business impact relatively late in the year. It
won't necessarily impact our overall Commercial business.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay, great. I guess just one thing on the whole sales force productivity and everything
else that you guys are trying to push through, and maybe a question for Michael, are you thinking that there's maybe – I
know you have very lean OpEx already, but is there any way to actually look at the cost base of Dell further do you
think, as you go through this process?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: You kind of broke up, Kulbinder, on that last – any way to do what?
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Can you lower the cost base or on the OpEx side going forward, during the sales force
productivity process you're going through?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, I'll take a first crack at that. I mean I think there are parts of our cost structure that
clearly are variable. In a lower revenue environment, clearly we had variable sales compensation that was impacted in
the quarter and that shows up. I think there are other places where we're clearly going to stick to the strategy and
continue to make investments that drive the long-term transformation of the business.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Well, yeah, I mean we do see productivity potential on a per sales-maker basis that we will
leverage throughout the year, so we believe they underperformed to their capacity this quarter. So we're not expecting
to have to add to get to this revenue growth. We think we can leverage the resources we have, if we better utilize them
from the points I made earlier.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes. Thank you. This question is either for Steve or Michael. The SMB revenue and
operating margin held up fairly well, relative to the other segments. The question really is, is this a function of Dell
maybe having greater early success with your value add solution sales? And if this is the case, how long will it take to
replicate in the larger Enterprise business or public?
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Well, you hit it on the head I believe. If you really look at this, the amount of complexity and
change has probably been the least in the SMB space because the sales motion is simpler. Even when you're selling a
more sophisticated solution, you're usually dealing with one person on the other end of the selling chain here. So it's

typically a one-to-one relationship and you bring experts in as required. As we move into these much larger spaces, it's
definitely a longer sales cycle. You're dealing with more constituents. It's a longer process. And I think we're still
feeling our way through that. And so that's why we do have confidence that what we're building here is definitely
scalable. We've just got to get refinement in it to make sure we're doing it the right way.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yeah, and the results clearly point to that. I mean if you look at the enterprise Solutions and
Services and SMB, we're up 17%. It was led by services, which were up 23% in SMB. And we're bolstering the kind of
offerings that those customers will latch on to quickly in backup, replication, network security with the SonicWALL
acquisitions. So we're feeling confident in our ability to expand that part of the business.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. Thank you. And then my follow up is really just around the large enterprise
commentary earlier. Brian, in terms of the delayed IT spending that you talked about or deferrals, can you provide us
some more details just on the timing? When does this manifest? Was it just in month of April? And is it continuing?
And what's kind of the breadth? I mean is it just targeting PCs? Or is it servers, networking, security, even outside of
your own business? Are you hearing about other parts of software being impacted as well?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I can take that one. And the reason we said that was because we did see healthy
pipeline building going on throughout the quarter and then we did see it slip. So as the quarter went by, so yes, in April,
we thought we would convert a lot more business, but we did see it slip. But we didn't see the pipelines go away. The
pipelines remain healthy and we have lots of anecdotes of customers just saying they're cautious. They're trying to
spread out their budget and things like that. So we had enough evidence of that to feel like this is a bit of a pattern
going on. The pipeline remains healthy. We are seeing some conversion happen so these things aren't going away and
that's why we're trying to be patient here. It did happen across the board. It wasn't just notebooks.
As good as our Storage business was, we probably could have even done better in Storage, based on the pipeline that
we have. So I think it's a broad based budget concerns by customers. And we're watching this on a month-to-month
basis.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yeah, and as we mentioned earlier, we first look to our own execution and we see opportunities
to improve there. But we tend to be closer to the action in terms of customer spending. I can tell you my own
interactions with larger customers, we are seeing kind of delay and pause in spending activity. But the pipelines are
healthy and we're very focused on bringing that business to closure.

We'll take our next question from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Two questions please. First, I wanted to get your take on the Windows 8 impact on the
Consumer business. And the areas I was hoping you could address are mix, how you think the mix of, say, tablets
versus ultrabooks will unfold? And then also on consumer behavior with consumers having to get used to, or
acclimated to, the Metro interface and the applications that may or may not be supported leading to also the potential
impact of Windows 8 on margins, if you do have more tablets and/or higher cost touch-screen notebooks how that
might impact your margins? And then I have a follow up, please. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Felice>: Well, those are great questions. I don't think we have all the answers to those questions. But
what I can tell you is that we think that the touch screen products will certainly cost more. They're more in the price
points and price bands that we tend to operate in. We will have the full complement of products around the time of
Windows 8 being announced and available. We think there will be -- unlike other Windows transitions, this is a
transition where you generally are going to need a new PC whether it's a tablet or an ultrabook with touch or a
notebook with touch or a PC with touch, or some derivative hybrid of all of the above type products. The product
refresh cycle associated with this release of Windows is likely to be very different from other releases. But it's hard to
know exactly what that looks like. We're preparing a full complement of products and we'll be ready with those as we

said earlier at the time of the Windows 8 release.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Fair enough. Then my follow up is on the Services side. If I look at the breakout
infrastructure and cloud and applications and BTO were, if I add them together, roughly flat, and support was still up
nicely. How should we be thinking about if unit growth slows here, or indeed has slowed, the combined growth rate of
Services as we look out over the next couple quarters given what I just mentioned, that two of the buckets look like the
revenue categories are running about flat and unit growth I would think would slow the support and deployment. But
any color on the average growth rate of Services would be helpful? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Keith, on the Support side, I mean we've been living with a lower unit growth
environment for a while. The team's done a very good job of driving growth in that business with improved attach
rates, as well as just execution. I would also say that as you think about infrastructure, cloud, security, apps, BPO, these
are places we're making investments today. We're doing, in some cases, some pruning in those businesses to improve
profitability. We've seen that actually happen. And I would say that that's a place that we would expect to see
increasing growth as we move forward.

We'll now take our final question from Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Brian, going back to gross margin, if I wrap all your
comments together, it actually sounds like you feel pretty good about where you stand with regards to the margins at
this point in the year relative to your expectations. I guess you mentioned, you're getting pressured by PC ASPs,
obviously, but you said you actually think components feel maybe a little bit better than they did three months ago. And
Enterprise should help as we go through the year. So is that an accurate assessment of your comments, I guess? And if
so, should we actually still expect your margins to improve as we move through the year on the gross margin side?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I think, Ananda, you hit some of the tailwinds that I think should help here. Clearly,
the mix of the business and driving stronger growth in Enterprise Solutions and Services has to be a key element of the
story. The biggest challenge or the new dynamic that we're facing into is really client pricing and the competitiveness
that we see there. So if we can balance those things as we move forward, we would expect to see gross margins
relatively stable or improving.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Thanks. And just a follow up if I could. Have you gotten the sense that – pretty clear you guys
walked away from some lower end business on the PC side. Do you have sense of value relative to the market in the
mid-range and in higher-end PC ASP bands that you're focused on?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, we think we fared well in the mid and high-priced band. One good example is we
know we're doing really well with our XPS 13, our first ultrabook. We know we're taking a lot of share with that. And I
think even if you look at some industry data like what's selling in retail in the U.S., you'll see those results. So we think
we're faring well there. In certain geographies we know we're holding our own. So where we are losing share, it's in
places where the profitability is very low.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Got it. Thanks a lot.
