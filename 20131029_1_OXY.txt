MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the third quarter 2013 earnings release conference call. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Mr. Stavros, you may now begin.
Christopher G. Stavros
Thank you, Tamika. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in Occidental Petroleum's third quarter
2013 earnings conference call. On the call with us this morning from Los Angeles are Steve Chazen, Oxy's President
and Chief Executive Officer; Cynthia Walker, our Chief Financial Officer; Willie Chiang, Oxy's Vice President of
Operations and Head of our Midstream Business; Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas operations;

Cynthia L. Walker
Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My comments will reference several slides in the conference call
materials that Chris referenced that are available on our website.
Overall in the third quarter, we continued the solid execution seen in the first half. Total company production was
767,000 BOE per day. And importantly, we produced 267,000 barrels of oil domestically. This is on track to achieve
our second half growth objectives. In addition, with three quarters of successful execution behind us, we are confident
that we will exceed the goals we set for the year for operating costs and capital efficiency.
We had core earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.97 per diluted share. And for the first nine months of 2013, we generated
$9.4 billion of cash flow from continuing operations before changes in working capital and ended the quarter with $3.8
billion of cash on our balance sheet.
If you turn to slide three, you'll see a summary of our earnings for the quarter. Core income was approximately $1.6
billion or $1.97 per diluted share. As you can see, this is an improvement over both of the prior quarters. Compared to
the second quarter of 2013, the current quarter results reflected improved Oil and Gas segment earnings, driven by
higher realized oil prices and domestic volumes as well as higher core earnings in the Chemicals segment and improved
performance in the Midstream segment, driven by higher margins in the marketing and trading businesses, largely due
to commodity price movements.
Now I will discuss the segment performance for the Oil and Gas business, and begin with earnings on slide four. Oil
and Gas earnings for the third quarter of 2013 were $2.4 billion, an increase over both the second quarter of 2013 and
the third quarter of 2012. On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, improvements came from higher oil prices and
domestic volumes. Volume increases resulted largely from higher oil production in California, the Permian and
Williamston, and improved Colombia liftings.
Moving to slide five, you'll see a summary of production changes during the quarter. As I mentioned, total production
for the quarter was 767,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 5,000 barrels per day over the second quarter and an increase
of 1,000 barrels per day over the year-ago quarter. On a sequential quarterly basis, these results reflect domestic oil
production growth as a result of our drilling program as well as a resumption of Permian production following plant
turnarounds and weather interruptions in the second quarter.
As you can see, we also experienced an improved environment in Colombia, although disruptions continued to impact
production in the quarter, and we've seen the same early in the fourth quarter. MENA [Middle East-North Africa]
production was lower, primarily due to the impact of full cost recovery on our contract in Yemen, lower spending in
Iraq, some maintenance in Qatar, and labor issues in Libya. Excluding certain of these impacts and the disruptions in
Colombia, our overall international production was in line with our guidance on the last call. On a year-over-year basis,
full cost recovery and other adjustments under our production sharing and similar contracts also reduced MENA
production by about 7,000 barrels per day.
If you turn to slide six, I'll now discuss our domestic production in a bit more detail. Our domestic production was
476,000 barrels per day, an increase of 6,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 2013 and an increase of 7,000
barrels per day for the third quarter of 2012. Focusing on our commodity composition, oil production increased 6,000
barrels from the second quarter, driven by California, the Permian, and the Williston Basin. For the first nine months of
2013, our domestic oil production has increased by 13,000 barrels per day. This is a 5% increase versus the same
period in 2012.

NGL production increased 2,000 barrels per day versus the second quarter. Natural gas volumes were lower by about
11 million cubic feet a day compared with the second quarter, almost entirely in the Permian as a result of third-party
processing bottlenecks.
Moving to our realized prices for the quarter and the comparison to benchmark prices, you can see the summary on
slide seven. Compared to the second quarter, our worldwide crude oil realized price increased about 6%, primarily
reflecting changes in benchmark prices. We experienced improvement in NGL prices domestically, which contributed
to a 5% increase in worldwide NGL realized prices; while domestic natural gas realized prices experienced a 14%
decrease, driven by the decline in the benchmark. You'll note we also included updated price sensitivities.
Next, I will cover production costs on slide eight. Oil and Gas production costs were $13.60 per barrel in the third
quarter and $13.64 per barrel for the first nine months of 2013 compared to $14.99 per barrel for the full year of 2012.
As you can see, domestic operating expenses increased slightly from the second quarter of 2013. This was due to the
timing of certain planned workover activities. International production costs have remained fairly consistent with 2012
levels excluding the impact of the facility turnarounds in Qatar and Dolphin that affected the first quarter of this year.
We are very pleased with our performance on operating costs this year and will beat our full-year target.
Taxes other than on income, which are generally related to product prices, were $2.61 per barrel for the first nine
months of 2013 compared with $2.39 per barrel for the full year of 2012. Third quarter exploration expense was $68
million, and we expect fourth quarter exploration expense to be about $100 million.
Turning to Chemicals segment core earnings on slide nine, third quarter earnings of $181 million were $37 million
higher than the second quarter, primarily driven by strong caustic soda export volumes and lower energy and ethylene
costs. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, demand for chlor-alkali products is typically lower due to seasonal factors.
We expect fourth quarter 2013 earnings to decline to approximately $100 million, driven by these seasonal factors
coupled with lower [ph] foreign needs (8:18) demand and lower caustic soda spot and export prices.
On slide 10 is a summary of Midstream segment earnings. They were $212 million for the third quarter of 2013
compared to $48 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $156 million in the third quarter of 2012. The 2013
sequential quarterly improvement in earnings resulted mainly from higher marketing and trading performance, driven
by commodity price movements during the quarter. The year-over-year improvement was driven by improved margins
in our pipeline and gas processing businesses.
The worldwide effective tax rate on core income was 40% for the third quarter. The lower tax rate than guidance
resulted from lower volumes in Libya, where tax rates are significantly higher than our overall effective tax rate. We
expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2013 to remain in the 40% to 41% range.
Slide 11 summarizes our year-to-date 2013 cash flow. In the first nine months of 2013, we generated $9.4 billion of
cash flow from continuing operations before changes in working capital. Working capital changes increased our cash
flow from operations by $400 million to $9.8 billion.
Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2013 were $6.4 billion, of which $2.2 billion was spent in the third
quarter. We generated approximately $270 million of cash from the sale of a chemical investment and used $340
million for acquisitions of domestic oil and gas assets.
After paying dividends of $1 billion and other net flows, our cash balance was $3.8 billion at September 30. Our
debt-to-capitalization ratio remains at 15% at the end of the quarter. Our annualized return on equity for the first nine
months of 2013 was 14%, and return on capital employed was 12%.
Last, I'll turn to the fourth quarter outlook. With respect to production; domestically, as I mentioned, we are on track to
achieve our second half oil growth average of 6,000 to 8,000 barrels per day increase over the first half average. Our
natural gas and NGL volumes are expected to decline modestly in the fourth quarter due to lower drilling on gas
properties and natural decline coupled with the effect of a major turnaround in the Permian.
Internationally, we expect total production to be about flat in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter
excluding the impact of insurgent activity in Colombia. We expect international sales volumes to increase in the fourth

quarter, recouping the deferred liftings we experienced earlier in the year.
Our annual capital is expected to be about $9 billion. This is about $600 million lower than the $9.6 billion program
we've previously discussed. Of this reduction, approximately $200 million resulted from achieving better than planned
efficiencies in our oil and gas program, particularly in our drilling costs. An additional $200 million resulted primarily
from the deferral of certain oil and gas facilities and Midstream projects into 2014 and a further $100 million for lower
than planned spending in Iraq. We are particularly pleased that we are on track to meet or exceed our planned drilling
activity levels for the year while spending less capital than planned as a result of efficiency initiatives.
I'll now turn the call over to Sandy Lowe, who will provide an overview of our Middle East-North Africa operations.
Edward A. Lowe
Thank you, Cynthia.
As you are aware, we have had a successful involvement in the Middle East-North Africa region for over 40 years. We
are active in key major oil-producing countries in the region and have formed excellent relationships at all levels. The
countries in which we operate include Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Bahrain, Libya, and Yemen. We
have a diverse set of projects in the region and manage all of our products with high safety standards, creating local
jobs and development opportunities for people in local communities.
Our current producing operations have generated over $20 billion of net free cash flow in the past 15 years and are
currently generating annual free cash flow of around $1.6 billion excluding the Al Hosn gas project capital, which is
currently running at about $1 billion annually. We reasonably expect that our Middle East business will generate over
$2 billion of free cash flow annually once the Al Hosn gas project becomes operational.
We have invested $9 billion of capital in the Middle East region since 2010, 75% of which has been spent in Oman,
Abu Dhabi, and Qatar. We have drilled over 2,500 wells in the region during this time and currently have 37 drilling
rigs running.
We have also spent $300 million on exploration since 2010. Our projects make a significant contribution to the
economies of these countries, employing around 15,000 full-time employees and contractors without counting the
workforce at the Al Hosn gas project, which is currently over 34,000. We have drilled several types of wells throughout
the region. These include onshore oil wells in Oman, offshore wells in Qatar, and sour gas wells onshore Abu Dhabi.
The production from our wells ranges from 200 to 4,500 barrels of oil per day, and our gas rates are as high as 120
million standard cubic feet per day.
Our Middle East operations are designed to leverage our technical expertise based in central support groups such as
project management, engineering, exploration, and drilling. We apply this knowledge locally to successfully execute
our projects. We have used this central support approach effectively in the areas of reservoir characterization, flood
implementation, drilling and completion techniques, and management of major projects. This enables us to apply best
practices across the region while minimizing the deployment of Western expatriates and maximizing opportunities for
nationals in each country.
We expect that our net Middle East production for 2013 will exceed 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day,
representing about 35% of Oxy's total production worldwide. When the Al Hosn gas project reaches full operational
status in 2015, it should add net production of over 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Our 2013 Middle East development capital is expected to be about $3 billion, with about 44% spent on water flood
projects, 34% on the Al Hosn gas project, 12% on steam floods, and 10% on primary production. We will drill over
750 development wells this year and plan on around 665 wells next year.
Our strategic goals for our Middle East business can be summarized as follows: continue to be a growing, profitable,
and vibrant business in the Middle East region; continue to be a preferred strategic partner with the host countries
where we operate; expand our Middle East area of business by partnering with local investors to secure strategically

important growth projects; continue to successfully execute projects; achieve returns in excess of 20% on our invested
capital; continue our investment philosophy where our presence makes meaningful contributions to the host economies
and makes a positive difference to the lives of the people in the local communities, including increased education and
employment opportunities for nationals.
We have a strong track record in each of the goals summarized above and believe we will be able to deliver
successfully on each of these going forward. In particular, we have developed and nurtured close relationships with key
partners in the countries we operate. We have always been respectful of the interests, expertise, and values of the host
countries. This philosophy has over time led to mutual respect and helped us grow our operations profitably.
I will now provide a brief summary of our operations in three of the key countries in the Middle East region, which
collectively make up 70% of our current production, 85% of our income from operations, and nearly all of our free cash
flow. We spend about 75% of our Middle East capital in these three countries as well.
Oman, we have been present in Oman for 34 years and operating Block 9, Block 27, and Block 62 in the north of
Oman, and Block 53, which is the Mukhaizna field. We are the largest independent oil producer in Oman and have a
highly skilled and loyal national staff. Our Omani staff has grown from 246 in 2005 to 1,858 today. Most of our
national employees have developed their skills and experience within Oxy, including opportunities to train and work on
Oxy projects in the United States and other countries. As a result, over 81% of our employees are Omani nationals, and
Omani citizens now hold most of the high-level executive positions, including the President of our Oman business unit.
Oxy's gross production is expected to be about 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013, with a net of 76,000 in
Oman. Our Omani operations are a significant free cash flow generator. We expect to continue to achieve returns well
in excess of 20% from our Oman projects.
Northern Oman; in northern Oman a combination of development wells, exploration success, and the application of
water flooding techniques has led to an increase in gross production from 92,000 to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent
per day since 2010. We have a large pipeline hub and gas plant at Safah associated with the producing wells in northern
Oman. This infrastructure enables us to rapidly and efficiently bring new wells into production. Most wells initially
free flow and later have either gas lift or electric submersible pumps installed.
We have maintained our gross average operating cost at around $5.50 per barrel, with the key drivers being downhole
maintenance, surface operations, and support costs. We have drilled 107 out of our 153 planned wells for this year.
These are typically horizontal wells with lateral length of between 1,800 and 3,500 feet. Recent production rates have
been as high as 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an average for 2013 of around 550. During 2014 we plan to
drill another 125 development wells.
Over the next five years, our plan includes drilling 400 development and water injection wells. We expect our annual
drilling capital to be between $250 million to $300 million per year. We believe our development program will increase
gross production to about 125,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during this period.
Our exploration program in northern Oman has been one of our most successful ever as a company, with a discovery
rate of greater than 60%. We attribute this success to our use of technologies such as horizontal drilling, state-of-the-art
3D seismic, as well as the development of new play concepts. Our discoveries this year, mostly coming from horizontal
wells, have an average production of 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and produce over 70% oil.
We continue to expand our technical understanding and have a robust inventory of future drilling prospects. In
addition, we are nearing completion of a 2,000 square mile 3D seismic program, which should further enhance our
growth portfolio. This new seismic data, over Block 9 and Block 27, should yield many attractive prospects and enable
us to continue exploring in these areas for many years. Over the next five years, we expect to drill more than 50
exploration wells, 13 of which are planned for 2014, and to generate more than 250 new development drilling
locations.
Our Block 62 development is in the early stages of engineering, with a number of gas producers already drilled. We are
planning to further delineate one of the largest structures by the end of this year, allowing an updated development plan

to be presented to the government during 2014.
Mukhaizna; Mukhaizna is one of the world's largest steam flood projects. At the end of 2012, it ranked third in the
world in terms of steam flood production, ahead of the large, best known U.S. steam floods. Oxy's involvement in the
Mukhaizna field began in 2005. Since that time, we have increased gross production from 8,000 to 125,000 barrels of
oil per day and produced 160 million barrels of oil from the field. We have drilled over 2,000 wells, of which 825 are
producers.
The steam wells enable injection of over 500,000 barrels per day. Waste heat recovery systems on power generators
account for 20% of our steam. We continue to optimize the development plan in this field with the government and our
partners, and we expect to continue executing our infield drilling program. The anticipated peak production is estimated
to be between 135,000 and 140,000 barrels of oil per day.
We expect to drill 340 wells this year. Recent rates have been as high as 830 barrels of oil per day, with an average for
2013 of around 330 barrels of oil per day. We plan to drill another 300 wells in 2014.
We currently have six rigs running in Mukhaizna. In addition to the main Mukhaizna reservoirs, we are delineating the
extensive Kahmah fractured carbonate heavy oil reservoir, which lies above the main pay in Mukhaizna. We presently
have one rig dedicated to this activity. Another milestone will be reached in Mukhaizna next year with the drilling of
our first deep exploration well in the field.
Qatar, we presently operate three shallow water offshore oil fields in Qatar, the Idd El Shargi North Dome, Idd El
Shargi South Dome, and Al Rayyan. We also have an interest in the Dolphin project, which has been a great success
since its start. Through our plans for various projects in Qatar, we expect to achieve returns well in excess of 20%. In
nearly 20 years in Qatar, we have invested $4.3 billion and produced 680 million barrels of oil. Our operations in Qatar
provide significant free cash flow. Current production is around 106,000 barrels of oil per day for 2013 from the three
fields, netting 67,000 barrels of oil per day to Oxy. Dolphin's current production net to Oxy is about 38,000 barrels oil
equivalent per day.
In Qatar, as in Oman, we are focused on the development of national staff and have successful national employees in
all levels in the company. Oxy has established itself as an active and committed member of the community. During our
presence in Qatar, we have forged strong and effective relationships with a number of organizations in the focus areas
of health, education, arts and culture, and sports. Examples include partnering with the Supreme Education Council and
the Weill Cornell Medical College in the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, which is aligned with Qatar's 2030 national
vision. Other initiatives are related to specific causes such as diabetes, cancer, working with the Al-Noor Institute for
the Blind, partnering with the Qatar Museums Authority, and supporting a number of sporting events.
In the Idd El Shargi North Dome, we will drill 17 wells in 2013 from jack-up rigs in a water depth of around 130 feet.
Over the course of our involvement in Qatar since 1994, we have drilled 268 horizontal producing wells and over 100
horizontal water injectors.
Recent well production rates in Idd El Shargi North Dome have been as high as 4,500 barrels of oil per day and an
average for 2013 of around 1,460 barrels of oil per day. As part of our recently approved Phase V development plan,
we will drill another 205 wells at a cost of $1.2 billion. We plan to drill 36 of these wells in 2014. The development
plan includes the installation of new wellhead platforms, a compression and power platform, and various pipelines and
related facilities. We believe that as a result of this development, we will be able to continue the plateau gross
production of 100,000 barrels of oil per day for many years to come. We also have new development opportunities
being planned for the Idd El Shargi South Dome and Al Rayyan fields.
Dolphin, the Dolphin project remains one of the flagship projects in the region, and it has been a great success since
coming on stream in 2007. The project involves production from wells located on two offshore platforms in the North
field of Qatar. Wet gas flows to the onshore gas plant at Ras Laffan will be processed into condensate, natural gas
liquids, and sulfur. The dry gas is exported over a long-term contract to the UAE by a 48-inch, 230-mile subsea
pipeline. In addition to the 2 billion cubic feet a day of contracted gas from Qatar, we transport additional gas on an
interruptible basis to customers in the UAE.

While meeting a significant portion of the UAE's gas needs, Dolphin also provides gas to Oman. We are currently
expanding gas compression facilities in Ras Laffan to achieve the maximum pipeline capacity of 3.5 billion cubic feet
per day to handle additional volumes. We believe substantial opportunities remain in the region to sign up additional
customers to provide gas transportation up to the full capacity of the Dolphin pipeline, generating additional midstream
revenues and gas flows. We expect our 2013 net production from Dolphin to be around 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent
per day, with significant free cash flow which we believe will grow over time as we take on new customers.
The United Arab Emirates, Oxy's initial experience in the UAE was as a partner in offshore exploration during the
1960s. Most recently, Oxy has had a presence in the UAE since 2000. Since then, our Abu Dhabi office has developed
into a regional hub supporting our Middle East assets with engineering, geoscience, business development, operations,
supply chain, and finance resources. During this time, the Dolphin midstream infrastructure has continued to expand,
and the pipeline system now extends for 475 miles throughout the UAE and into Oman.
The Al Hosn gas project, where we are partnering with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ADNOC, involves the
development of the Shah sour gas field in the western region of Abu Dhabi. Production from the field contains natural
gas and condensate along with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. A large processing plant is
currently under construction with an average 34,000 workers at the site. This is a world-scale mega-project with the
involvement of major engineering, construction, and manufacturing companies from around the world. It remains on
schedule and on budget. When completed, the plant will be able to process about 1 million cubic feet a day of gas from
the field and separate it into sales gas condensate, natural gas liquids, and sulfur. Oxy's net share of production is
expected to be over 200 million standard cubic feet of sales gas and more than 20,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate.
By the end of 2013, the project will be about 92% complete and it will start up next year.
The 2013 Oxy share of Al Hosn capital is expected to be about $1 billion. Total project cost is expected to be on budget
at about $10 billion with Oxy's share of $4 billion. We expect production from the project to start in the fourth quarter
of 2014. Once the field achieves steady state, annual average free cash flow to Oxy should be approximately $600
million at current liquids prices. Currently, we are spending about $1 billion per year so steady-state operation should
provide a net cash flow swing of $1.6 billion annually.
As we have recently announced, we are currently looking to sell a minority interest in our Middle East-North Africa
operations. We believe this will give us an exciting opportunity to possibly partner with key regional players. This sale
will reduce the Middle East-North Africa share in our overall portfolio. We believe a partnership with regional
investors will align us with local interests in our existing operations and on new opportunities throughout the Middle
East to achieve future growth from a lower base.
In summary, we believe we are well positioned to meet each of our strategic goals in the region. Specifically, we have a
highly profitable, vibrant, and growing business. We have developed strong and lasting relationships with host
countries where we are welcomed and invited to stay. We will continue to be a preferred strategic partner to them in the
years to come.
Our plans to sell a minority in our Middle East-North Africa operations will assure that we will continue to grow our
Middle East-North Africa business profitably over time by securing strategically important future projects. Our
development and operating plans will ensure continued success in executing our projects. We will continue to achieve
returns in excess of 20% of our invested capital. We are continuing to apply our investment philosophy where our
presence makes meaningful contributions to the host economies and makes a positive difference in the lives of the
people in the local communities, including increased education and employment opportunities for nationals.
In closing, I would like to emphasize we are very excited about our presence and our opportunities in the Middle East.
We believe that our excellent relationships and partnerships with key regional players coupled with our long regional
experience and our track record of timely project execution will allow us to continue to enhance our rich growth
potential of the region.
I will now turn the call over to Steve Chazen, who will discuss our strategic initiatives.

Stephen I. Chazen
Thank you, Sandy. Earlier this month we announced the initial phase of the company's strategic review as a part of an
effort to streamline and focus our operations in order to better execute the company's long-term strategy and enhance
value for our shareholders.
As a result of the initial actions, Oxy's Board of Directors has authorized the following: to pursue a sale of a minority
interest in the Middle East-North Africa operations in a financially efficient manner, as Sandy just discussed; pursue
strategic alternatives for selective Midcontinent assets, including our oil and gas interests in the Williston, Hugoton,
Piceance Basin, and other Rocky Mountain assets; and the completed the sale of a portion of our 35% interest in the
General Partner of Plains All-American Pipeline. This results in pre-tax proceeds of $1.4 billion. This initial sale
process has concluded and we have received the proceeds. Our cash balance of $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter
does not include these proceeds. Oxy's remaining interest in Plains All-American Pipeline based on the IPO price is
valued at approximately $3.3 billion.
As we indicated, these are our first formal steps in our effort to streamline the business, concentrate in areas where we
have depth and scale, and improve overall profitability. Our goal is to become a somewhat smaller company with more
manageable exposure to political risk. We will continue to seek additional strategic alternatives for the company to
maximize total returns to our shareholders.
These actions are expected to generate a significant amount of proceeds. Together with the excess cash on the
company's balance sheet, these funds will largely be used to reduce Oxy's capitalization. While we expect to use a
substantial and a vast majority of these proceeds to repurchase our shares, we also anticipate paying down some of our
debt on a proportional basis. We expect to retire $600 million of bonds due in December. We also expect to reinvest a
portion of these proceeds in high return growth opportunities throughout the business, several of which I'll discuss in a
moment. We continue to make steady progress and expect to complete the strategic review in the coming months, and
will disclose material developments as they occur.
Approximately a year ago, our Oil and Gas business embarked on an aggressive plan to improve our operational
efficiency across all cost categories, including capital, with a view to achieving an appreciable reduction in our
operating expenses and drilling costs. Our teams are to be commended for doing a superb job on this front, exceeding
our initial goals. We continue to run ahead of our full-year objectives to improve domestic operational and capital
efficiencies. For example, we have reduced our domestic well costs by 22% and operating costs by about 18% relative
to last year. This is ahead of our previously stated targets of 15% well cost improvement and total Oil and Gas
operating costs below $14 per barrel. Total annualized savings from these operating costs and capital efficiency
initiatives amount to $1.2 billion compared to last year.
We expect these savings to result in additional development opportunities, as previously marginal projects are now
economic. The purpose of these initiatives is to improve our return on capital while continuing to execute a focused
drilling program in our core areas and grow our domestic oil volumes. The benefit of these cost savings cannot be
overstated, as they will result in a year-over-year improvement in F&D costs, leading to a more stable DD&A rate. We
believe we can sustain the benefits realized to date, achieve additional savings in our drilling costs, and reach our 2011
operating cost level over time without a loss in production or sacrificing safety.
We are particularly pleased that we are on track to meet or exceed our drilling activity levels planned for the year while
spending less capital than planned as a result of these efficiencies. These achievements have generated higher margins,
giving us confidence to allocate additional capital toward profitable growth opportunities.
As Vicki discussed in last quarter's call, we are the largest oil and gas mineral acreage holder in California, with more
than 2.1 million net acres. We have a large and diverse portfolio of opportunities available to us across the state. We've
reduced our overall operating costs in California by more than $4 a barrel equivalent to an expected average of under
$19 for all of 2013. Improvement in our operating as well as our drilling costs have exceeded our targets and should
allow for combined savings of at least $300 million this year compared with 2012. As a result of these improvements
and combined with more favorable permitting, we plan to increase our capital spending in California by about $500

million to approximately $2.1 billion next year. Most of this increase will be directed towards unconventional drilling
opportunities, where we have more than 1 million prospective acres for unconventional resources.
In the Permian Basin we have accumulated more than 1.7 million net acres, covering both relatively established and
emerging plays, anchored by our core, high free cash generating CO2 flood reservoirs. We have recently created an
exploitation team whose mandate is to optimize our drilling capabilities and accelerate the development of our
unconventional opportunities throughout the basin.
This year we have focused on delineating incremental opportunities in established plays as well as testing the potential
of many emerging plays, which included the drilling of approximately 30 horizontal wells. We've also succeeded in
reducing our drilling cost by more than 20%, which has increased our ability to enhance our economics, utilizing
horizontal drilling and multi-stage completions to develop and establish unconventional reservoirs.
As a result of these efforts, we can now shift our development strategy and expect to spend an additional $500 million
in capital next year, largely directed towards increased drilling of horizontal wells. The step-up in capital will allow for
an additional four rigs, which will be dedicated to drilling horizontal wells in our focus plays at Wolfcamp, Wolfbone,
and Bone Springs in the Delaware Basin, as well as the Wolfcamp in the Midland Basin. As an example of this, we
recently completed a well in our South Curtis Ranch area, which is near our Mabee acreage. It was completed in the
Wolfcamp B and has tested just over 1,000 barrels of oil per day, 77% which is oil, 15% NGLs, with a small amount of
remaining of natural gas. We have over 17,000 net acres that are prospective for this in the area. This represents a
major change in our Permian non-CO2 development strategy, which the number of horizontal wells drilled next year
will account for more than 50% of total wells compared to only 10% during 2013.
Turning to our international operations, our 30-plus year history of operating in Colombia has provided us with a
unique insight over heavy oil production, mature oil field development opportunities. Historically, this has been among
Oxy's most profitable operations. The experience associated with steam flood development is a core competency at
Oxy, a skill that fits well with Colombia's strategy to grow its crude oil production. Going forward, we intend to focus
our efforts on applying our expertise for the pursuit of high additional high return oil redevelopment projects, and we
expect to participate in several more steam flood projects in the coming years.
In our Middle East-North Africa business and as Sandy discussed, the majority of the value of our production incoming
cash flow is derived from three key countries, Oman, Qatar, and the UAE. The majority of our regional capital is also
deployed in these countries, and we expect our MENA business will generate more than $2 billion a year of annual free
cash flow after the Al Hosn gas project becomes operational.
We feel fortunate to have had many successful years operating in the region. Part of this we believe is the result of
successfully executing on a number of challenging projects. We also feel it is in part due to the mutual respect we have
for our partners, the host countries in which we operate, and the people that reside there. Although a sale of a minority
interest would reduce our share of MENA within our overall portfolio, we expect to remain a major participant in the
region with a focused. Our track record of success and strong relationships should allow us to compete for new projects
and provide us with future growth off a smaller base. We look forward to forging new partnerships in the region, which
will allow us to continue our profitable growth strategy.
Opportunity for high growth is also present in our Chemicals business, where we plan to pursue a 50:50 joint venture
with Mexichem and build a world-scale ethylene cracker at the OxyChem plant in Ingleside. As a part of this long-term
strategic supply relationships between companies, essentially all the ethylene produced in the cracker will be consumed
by Oxy in the manufacture of vinyl chloride monomer, utilizing our existing VCM production capacity. The VCM will
then be delivered to Mexichem to produce polyvinyl chloride PVC and PVC piping systems. Using the cracker,
OxyChem's overall operations effectively consume more than one-third of Oxy's domestic gas and NGL production. A
significant benefit of this project is that it provides a higher level of integration from the wellhead through to VCM
production and sales.
The project is just one example of several we plan to pursue in our effort to capture greater value in the downstream
portion of the natural gas and the NGL trains versus an independent upstream gas producer. Construction of the

Ingleside cracker project is expected to begin in mid-2014, with the facilities becoming commercially operational in
2017. We expect it to have a material benefit in our Chemical earnings. OxyChem is also expected to continue to be
free cash flow positive throughout the investment phase of the project.
In the Midstream segment, our investment in the BridgeTex pipeline continues on track for a scheduled startup in
mid-2014. The roughly 450-mile long pipeline will be capable of transporting approximately 300,000 barrels a day of
crude oil between the Permian region and the Gulf Coast refinery markets. We are confident these and other
opportunities to deploy our capital will be meaningful drivers of our earnings growth over the coming years.
I think we're now ready to take your questions.

Tamika, can you please poll the line for questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Steve, I've got a couple if I may. Good morning. Starting with the Middle East, there has been a
lot of speculation over the potential value that may or may not be associated with this asset. I know you can't give
specifics. But could you frame for us, given the relative lack of transparency in terms of – you've done a good job today
of laying out the businesses, but reserve bookings and so on are still somewhat lacking transparency. So can you help
frame for us what you think a realistic acceptable range of value might be and whether or not the Midstream would be
part of that? And I've got a couple follow-ups, please.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yes, the Dolphin project would be part of the sale process, so that piece of our Midstream
business would be part of that sale. There are confidentiality agreements between the three major – in each of the
countries, so we can't actually give you more transparency without violating the confidentiality agreements. For
example, we can't tell you the details in Oman or Qatar or Abu Dhabi. I think it's fair to say that we book only to the
life of the lease. And as the extensions come, obviously more reserves come. We also appreciate basically over that life
because the earnings are somewhat understated.
I think if you look at the cash, we view it as an ongoing business. That is to say it's not just a pile of assets that we're
going to deplete. To the extent it's an ongoing business, we expect to receive a price that reflects the value of an
ongoing business, not the price of a depleting asset or necessarily the reserves that are there. The countries can see the
long-term reserves, so I don't think there's a lot of issue with them not understanding what the long-term outcome is. I
don't really want to negotiate with myself on the values.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay, a related question then, Steve, on the buybacks, the potential. There has been a number
bandied around in the press of $8 billion from the Middle East, but let's assume that was reasonable. I believe there are
some tax issues around what you can bring back as an optimum level. But if we don't look at Plains and potential
Mid-Continent sale, can you help frame for us what you see the scale of the buyback would be? And if I may just add
something to this; acquisitions in the Permian Basin seem to have slowed down. I guess valuations have something to
do with that. They're generating a lot of cash. So how should we think about buybacks on a go-forward basis to maybe
enhance your per-share growth?

Page 11 of 17
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think buybacks will be an important element of share growth, certainly in the next few
months. We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. We had $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter plus the money from
the sale of Midstream assets. We would expect to begin the repurchase of some shares shortly.
As far as the scale goes, we're not going to build cash. We're not going to pay down. Debt reduction will be
proportional. So if we sell 10% of the assets, maybe the debt will go down 10%. We only have about $7 billion of debt,
so it's not going to be a big user. These projects will probably allow us to still stay within our cash from operations next
year, so it's probably not going to drain a lot.
As far as acquisition is concerned, I think the issue in the Permian is about there's just not a lot for sale, and that which
is for sale isn't all that interesting. In the company, we have a lot of acreage. I've just highlighted just one small area
where we're doing well. We have a lot of acreage, and so the need to drive the business through large-scale acquisitions
is pretty modest at this point. So you should expect the bulk of the proceeds to go toward share repurchases and
[indiscernible] (51:55) we're not going to build cash. I can't tell you exactly the number. And one of the reasons why,
once we can frame this more clearly as to how much money is involved, then we can talk about the last steps in this.
But I think we need to see where we are.
Our goals are really twofold. We need to make sure we continue to operate well because that's really what drives value,
and we need to execute the things we've announced. So I think that's what we are trying to do. Once we get that at least
in sight, then we'll talk about further restructuring steps. Is that helpful or not?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Last one from me, I guess we're lacking specifics, Steve. So obviously, I think the market is
telling you that we're lacking specifics, so I guess we'll have to wait until you can give more color. But if I could try
one final one, if I may, your press release the other day failed to mention California. It continues to be a drag and,
frankly, I see it as an underperformer in the eyes of the market. What are the parameters that you think may or may not
contribute to your decision on whether or not California can do better on its own? I think that is clearly one of the key
gating items for the markets here on the restructuring on a go-forward basis. I'll leave it there, thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think if you go back to this question about buyback, you could come up with a very high
number without me telling you exactly what it is for the share repurchase. So you might be off $1 billion or $2 billion,
but that's about all. You could use the numbers that are floating around out there. You could guess what the proceeds
from the Mid-Continent sale would be within a few hundred million dollars and obviously see how much cash we have
now. I don't think anybody should be off very much in computing how much the share repurchase would be. Debt
reduction and the other stuff are not large in comparison to that.
As far as California is concerned, the fundamental question is can it operate better as a standalone business with a
different model? The different model, if it's going to operate just like it does now, then it might be better off staying the
way it is. But if it can operate better with a different model, that is a higher capital model of basically little or no
dividends and with a more entrepreneurial background, then I think that it would be better separated from the company.
More to the point, I think, is that separating California from the rest could enhance the visibility and the attractiveness
of the remaining business, and I think that's clear enough for now. Once we get some slightly better numbers on the
proceeds of these two areas we're working on now, then we can size California if we're going to do it appropriately.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks for taking my questions, Steve.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thanks.

<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Steve, you highlighted on some of the strategic review slides of a major change in strategy
in the Permian today that's going to be driven by this new exploitation team. And on this point, I wanted to see whether
you could provide some color, or whatever color you might have, on this new unconventional drilling group in the
Permian. And also, you also just mentioned a few minutes ago about the Plains All-American position, and the question
there is whether there's any strategic or operating rationale as to why the remainder may not be divested in the future,
so two questions.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The second one is easy to say. It will be divested in the future.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: When we entered into it, it was a private business, and I don't have any problem investing in
a private business that shareholders can't access if I think it makes sense for us. Once it becomes public and you can
duplicate the ownership with yourself, there's no reason for us to hold it. I'm going to let Vicki answer the question
about the operational group.
<A - Vicki Hollub>: Okay. First, I'd like to say thanks to our current Permian unconventional team that has gotten us
to where we are today because currently we're running seven horizontal rigs. We expect to ramp that up to 16 next year.
So we're now getting more aggressive with our properties in the Permian because we now understand them a little
better.
This exploitation team is going to be one that we have developed to get us into a position where we're more
entrepreneurial and much more aggressive in the way that we attack our unconventional opportunities in the Permian.
With this group, we expect it to start helping us to more accelerate those opportunities than two to three years out in our
typical development schedules. This team also will focus on ensuring that we provide the technical support to the
business unit to make sure that we're spacing our wells correctly, that we're adequately drilling our horizontal wells in
the correct direction and spacing. So the bottom line is we just expect this to be technical support to help us get more
aggressive.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Great, thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Yes, good morning, Steve.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: There's a statement in your slides on slide 35 saying expect to complete strategic review
in the coming months. Is that a statement just around the overall thinking about the business, or is that around the
timing that you might expect for making some of the disposals in the Mid-Continent and valorization in the Mideast
that you've discussed?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That was a decision about California.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Right.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: So that's intended to be as soon as we have clarity about the proceeds.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Right. Okay, good. And then...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's very disruptive, and I don't know if people understand it. We put out the announcement
so that we could go do the work because you can't just secretly go sell 9% of your assets. Once that's done, then we'll
look at the next step, what we need to do. But you can't just disrupt the whole organization all at once with this massive
idea without some pretty specific numbers.

<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: And then a question that maybe you'll be able to answer on the Middle East. Obviously,
it seems like there's a decent amount of growth still to go for, and thanks for the slides. Is there some sort of recovery
factors that you can give on these fields at present to give us some kind of a geological understanding? Even if you
can't talk about reserve bookings that could help us think about the long-term for these fields, particularly Oman.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Unfortunately, that's part of what you're supposed to keep a secret. They're very high
recoveries by U.S. standards or by current U.S. standards. They're like fields that were discovered in the U.S. in the
1930s, not like the fields that were discovered last week here.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Okay, and then the final one. Just the chemical cracker means world scale is $5 billion to
$7 billion. Is that the right ballpark for you?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No, nowhere near that. This is under $1 billion our share.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Okay, great, thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Hi, guys, just a question on the Permian here. Just looking at your oil production, it's been flattish
there for the last handful of quarters. Clearly, you're accelerating activity in 2014. You talked about an incremental
$500 million to drill horizontal, largely unconventional. You guys also talked about clearly significant proceeds coming
in the door soon. Ballpark, it's probably easy to get to something like a $10 billion type of number. Should we expect,
that is if you guys have success as we get through 2014, that 2015 and 2016 can see a lot more incremental capital into
the Permian given how big your acreage position is here?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I'd certainly hope so. If it isn't, then it hasn't been successful. But we expect the Permian to
be self-funding because there so much cash that comes out of the CO2 business.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay. I guess in terms of your activity there, you mentioned that acquisitions didn't seem like
they were as paramount. Do you think there's still potential for that down the road if something becomes available that
looks more attractive to you guys? Or do you think you have enough acreage to really drill this aggressively for many
years to come?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I don't think we need to do any acquisitions. Obviously, if something attractive comes
along, that's different, but certainly we're not going to press acquisitions.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay, great.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're better off, frankly, buying the shares with the money than doing the acquisitions.

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Complete, no because you've got to sign a lot of documents that in fact could probably fill a
room. I expect we'll have clarity as to the proceeds by the end of the year and probably the signing and the completion
in the first quarter.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: And when you talk about a minority, I think the previous guidance was 20%, 25% sale. Is that
still...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think you should think of it as being focused on how much money we can bring back in an
efficient manner rather than the exact percentage.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yes, and that's being reported...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: There's some amount of money which is a sizable number that we can bring back in an
efficient manner. The Middle East business generates a sizable amount of foreign tax credits. And so we have a pile of
those that we can use, and it will continue to generate foreign tax credits to shelter the income going forward. So if you
exceed what you have, you pay U.S. taxes on money that you would otherwise not pay taxes on. So we're mindful of
that in this phase.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: I understand.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I don't know if that was helpful or confusing.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: No, I think people are talking about an $8 billion type number as being the ultimate proceeds
and you work around the percentage share towards that. And then I think the year-end guidance that you've given, at
least what matters is the number is in line with what we were hoping.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're not going to go into the exact numbers. I don't think that's useful. Again, we're
negotiating with ourselves and we will not negotiate with ourselves on the phone.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yes, I understand. And the options for California, is that a spin, IPO? What are you thinking
there? Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We really haven't decided what the options are. Generally, simpler is better. Increased
complexity is probably not something I'm up for at this point.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: So would that imply a spin then?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: What is the simplest thing to do? There are two simple things to do and only two simple.
Everything else requires a lot of brain power. Remember, I'm short of that right now.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Fair enough, I think I'll leave it there. Thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Sven Del Pozzo with IHS.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Yes, good morning. We've seen a big run-up in Delaware Basin stocks over recent months.
I know you guys have a lot of acreage there. I think it's based on a relatively small number of successes in the
horizontal Wolfcamp, such as you had mentioned on your call. I'm wondering. Where do you think we stand in making
this play more repeatable in the Delaware Basin?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Vicki, do want to take a shot at that? That's true, there are relatively few wells. We are
encouraged with what is going on, so we'll let Vicki talk here for a minute.

<A - Vicki Hollub>: Sven, again, that's part of what the exploitation teams will be doing working with our current
business unit, and that is to look at the data in the Delaware. We do believe that there's potential there and it is
repeatable. One of the things that we're going to focus on trying to do is determine what drives the variations within the
reservoir. This team has the skill set, we believe, to work with the business units to accomplish that. So it's just the
variability that we want to understand a little bit better, but we do believe that that success is repeatable.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: In your opinion, is it more upside in the Wolfcamp formation or at Bone Springs or equal,
just as an idea? And then separately, Wolfcamp in the Midland Basin, how would you compare the two, answering the
question the same way just like you did now?
<A - Vicki Hollub>: I think that the upside in both Wolfcamp and Bone Springs will be ultimately pretty equal. And
the Wolfcamp in the Midland Basin, certainly we've had some recent success there. Based on the information that we
see from a couple wells we're drilling now and from offset operators, we're certain that that's going to be very
successful.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Thank you. Moving over to the Bakken for a moment, most of your drilling I think has been
in southwestern Dunn County [North Dakota]. Is that to hold the acreage by production, or is that just your own
choice? Because you've got a lot of acreage outside of that area as well, and I'm just wondering what your plans are for
developing that other acreage.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We've been focused on holding it by production.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The majority of the drilling is done for that purpose.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Okay, thanks. And then Pronghorn Sand in the Bakken, you mentioned that in your last
press release. Have you had any successful wells in the Pronghorn Sand? I know that there are offset operators that
have had success there. I'm wondering when you guys plan to drill Pronghorn Sand or if you have already.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Bill can answer that.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: We've drilled a couple of Pronghorn wells. And we've been very pleased with the success
that we've seen so far, so I think you can expect more of that.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Okay, and then finally, just a little bit of data points, if you could help me with the Dolphin
project equity income. I know you've disclosed that in the past, but it was a while back, and just to bring me up to speed
on what that is on an annualized basis and if that equity income number is a pre-tax number or a post-tax number. You
can get me that later if you what, or if you know it I'd appreciate it.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Roughly 60% of the income in the Midstream business is split between Dolphin,
Midstream, pipeline, and the Plains interest. So if you take our Midstream income for a year, I wouldn't use any quarter
numbers. Per year, about 60% comes from those two and it's maybe not quite equally divided, but something like that.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Okay, thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning. On the $2 billion of annual free cash flow you expect to generate out of the
MENA portfolio after the Al Hosn startup, can you discuss if that free cash flow number assumes that you continue to
spend capital on growth projects? And can you also discuss the CapEx number embedded in that free cash flow

number, if that's enough to replace reserves?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The answer is we continue to spend it on growth projects, and it would enough to replace
reserves.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Does that include some of the projects you're looking at in the UAE and in Oman, some of the
big...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It includes projects that are in hand now that we think we have. If we wanted to do
something brand new, it may have a different effect. But if you look at what we have in hand and projects in Qatar and
Oman and Abu Dhabi, it includes all of that. But if you said you can have some projects some other place that's
radically different, then we'd have maybe a different outcome. But this includes enough to replace production.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood. And then your comments on the favorable permitting environment in
California, is that a result of the law that was signed into – or the legislation that was signed into law by Jerry Brown,
or is there something else that's going on in terms of how you're lining up the permitting process in the state?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Vicki can answer that I think.
<A - Vicki Hollub>: Yes, I'd say that the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources [DOGGR] for the state of
California has been trying diligently to ensure that there is more certainty around the permitting process. And so they've
been processing permit applications as quickly as they can. Granted, it still takes a while in the state because of their
personnel resources. But just recently we've also been trying to anticipate the application of details from Senate Bill 4
that was just passed. And we're trying to ensure that we stay ahead of the anticipated specific requirements of that bill
to ensure that we're not negatively impacted by that.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: The Senate bill, does it help provide more transparency to the process, or does it make the
permitting process more difficult?
<A - Vicki Hollub>: It will provide more transparency, but it will also require more monitoring from the operator
standpoint, also more reporting. And we're hoping that the requirements are not so stringent that they overload the staff
that's DOGGR And that's the bigger issue for us is that increased permitting requirements is going to be a load on their
staff.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, thanks for the color, and just last question from me. Can you give us what you envision
the capital cost being for the ethylene plant, the gross cost?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I said that half of it would be under $1 billion.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, and so...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: So whether it's $750 million or $800 million or something like that, that's the range for half
of it.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And do you have all the permits in hand, the air permits and the CO2 permits?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yes, I think we're about set to go.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, great. I appreciate the time.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We'll be spending some money this year, but it will build up in 2014, 2015, and 2016.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood. Thank you for the time.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thanks.

We do have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Société
Générale.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Hi, two quick ones. Given more of an unconventional focus, should we expect to see your
PUD count go up in the U.S., Steve, as a percentage of proven?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I understand. The actual PUD count is very large. They're always very reluctant to book
PUDs, and you've got to put a gun to their head to get them to book PUDs. So I would suggest that the PUDs are likely
not to change very much as a percentage. It does not mean there aren't PUDs. It's just that they feel – and let me just tell
you why – they're borrowing from next year's program. So if they book a PUD, they book the barrels now and the
money gets spent next year, so they're afraid of hurting their F&D cost next year. So basically, you have this steady
state of PUDs and BEP adds. And therefore your F&D costs are, from the perspective of the people that do it, more
predictable. We can argue and I have with them, that there are more PUDs out there, but they tend to take a very
conservative view of it. I don't think there's any question about that. It's not the end of the world. There are worse
things you could do.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, that's fine. I was wondering whether you were going to be more like your peers because
you are more committed to it.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No, I think it requires brain surgery, and we're not up for that. That's part of my lack of
abilities as I get older.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, no lobotomies or pipping, next question. With California, you're spending more on
G&G, and you said you were going to do more unconventionally. Are you going to be outside existing areas for your
unconventional activities? What I'm trying to get at is in terms of volume recoupment, will production activities be
more protracted if you're not within your existing field areas, or TBD, to be determined?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think we're going to build out from our field areas rather than go off. Part of building
efficiency is to build out from your existing infrastructure. One of the keys for the next year or so is to keep the
efficiency strong, so we'll build out from where we are.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great, thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you. Chris?
