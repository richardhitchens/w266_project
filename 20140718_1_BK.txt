Great, thanks Izzy and welcome everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. So a few key takeaways for the
quarter, we're attacking our expense base, as we continue to align our operating model with the reality of the macro
environment. We are absolutely committed to aggressive expense management and to reducing structural costs, and it's
paying off, helping us generate positive operating leverage during the quarter.
Investment management fees and most of our investment services fees continue to grow, demonstrating our ability to
meet the increasingly complex investing needs of our clients. Our capital position remains strong, as does our ability to
generate capital, providing us with the financial flexibility to continue to return capital to shareholders.
So looking at our performance during the quarter. As you saw from the release, we reported earnings of $0.48 per
share, which included a $0.14 per share charge covering two items we previously disclosed. One, was a charge related
to certain investment management funds and two, a severance charge related to progress in streamlining our
organization, which I might add is expected to benefit our expense run rate in excess of the $120 million charge. And
we should begin to see the benefits this year with the full effect in 2015.
Now, when you add these items back, one might say that we earned $0.62 per share, but we think we really earned
about $0.58 per share on an operating basis.
So turning to revenues, total revenues were $3.7 billion. Investment management had a good quarter and continues to
demonstrate why we value this business. Investment management and performance fees were up 4% year-over-year,
and they were also up 5% sequentially.
Assets under management increased 15% year over year to a record $1.64 trillion. And we're continuing to execute on
our initiatives to drive future earnings growth, including our strategy to increase our focus on individuals as investors,
by broadening our reach to intermediaries and the retirement market and by expanding wealth management.
Now, another key strategy involves building out our local capabilities for clients looking to invest in Asia. In fact, in
APAC, we are currently on boarding our first client on to the separately managed account platform that we built in
conjunction with our Pershing operation. So we are not only attracting clients that will use our technology, but we are
also getting asset management mandates on it as well.
During the quarter, Insight Investment was named the winner of Global Investor magazine's annual award for
investment excellence as asset manager of the year in its category. Insight was also named the LDI Manager of the year
by the UK Pension Awards. So a great performance in our investment sector in that regard.
All in all, a good quarter for investment management, which remains a significant earnings contributor and capital
generator for our firm. We like the fact that this business is balance sheet light and that it continues to serve as a
valuable role in allowing us to leverage and deepen our client relationships across the company.
In investment services, asset servicing, clearing and treasury services fees grew nicely while issuer services was down.
Investment services business was again helped by the growing contribution from global collateral services, which
showed good growth during the quarter as usage of our optimization and segregation solutions continued to increase.
In global markets, the industry-wide low volatility negatively impacted our revenues but we've been able to offset that
partially as enhancements to our FX platform drove a significant increase in volumes. So, again, our investments are
paying off.
Now, during the quarter, our asset servicing and global collateral services capabilities received a number of awards for
innovation, service quality, and the strength of our capabilities. And we again came out on top of our peer group at a
key industry survey, this time in Global Custodian Mutual Fund Administration Survey.
Now on the expense front, earlier this year, we outlined some of the actions we're taking to manage expense growth,
including streamlining our organization, reducing our real estate footprint, consolidating platforms, reengineering
processes and getting more out of each technology dollar we spend.

I had said you would see evidence of all of these moves this year and our progress is now being reflected in our
numbers. We succeeded in reducing operating expenses both year-over-year and sequentially notwithstanding the
impact of regulatory risk and control-related expenses.
So let me highlight two important areas. The first item involves reducing employee costs. We made good progress in
streamlining our organization, which includes reducing positions and layers and getting to fewer, more effective
managers. The employee cost reductions are real and very sustainable. But while the cost savings are important, these
actions are not just about costs. They are about creating an organization that is better aligned and connected with our
clients and markets and cultivating a high performance culture.
And as part of these moves, we promoted Brian Shea to head Investment Services, bringing the front and back end
together to drive better client solutions and improve our productivity and efficiency. Curtis Arledge added to his
responsibilities the oversight of the newly formed BNY Mellon Markets Group which brings together global markets,
global collateral services and prime services.
Now, Curtis has extensive experience in capital markets and asset management and it gives him a unique insight into
the markets and needs of our clients, both buy side and sell side clients. That together with a new structure will help to
further accelerate the delivery to clients of solutions in trading, securities financing and securities lending. And I might
add importantly, our clients have told us this is how we should be organized to better serve them.
The second expense item is our real estate footprint. You saw that we reached an agreement to sell our One Wall Street
building for $585 million, which will reduce our New York City footprint by 750,000 square feet. Now, in terms of the
future financial impact, there will be some incremental expense in 2015 as we work through some overlapping
occupancy expense. And in 2016, we will see the benefit of this action and Todd will cover this more in just a moment.
Now, our focus is on driving productivity improvement across our businesses, across geographies, across functions and
doing it aggressively every single day.
Turning on to the capital front, we continue to generate significant levels of capital, resulting in strong capital ratios,
which provide us with the financial flexibility to return more to shareholders and drive shareholder value. During the
quarter we increased our dividend by 13%. We repurchased 12.6 million shares.
Now, another compelling statistic, since the financial crisis our strong capital generation has enabled us to more than
double our tangible capital while also reducing our shares outstanding below pre-crisis levels.
Now, before I hand it over to Todd, let me wrap up with an update on our corporate trust business. Back in May we
told you we were exploring whether the corporate trust business is worth significantly more to someone else rather than
to us. We have now completed that process. When we weighed the benefits of the sale of the current environment
against both the near term pressures on this business and the more positive long-term outlook, we concluded that we
can create more shareholder value by retaining it.
We will continue to focus on driving profitable growth. This business is positioned to benefit from the significant
upside for earnings and operating margins that will result from an eventual move to more normalized monetary policy,
the expected abatement in structured debt maturities and the potential recovery of the non-agency mortgage-backed
market. I have always liked this business and our leading market share position and I'm confident of its future growth
potential.
Now, the bottom line is we're executing to drive shareholder value through a focus on three activities: one, streamlining
our organization and continuously finding ways to improve our productivity and efficiency, primarily through
enhancement to our technology and operations, and by sustaining the momentum that we have established on the cost
front.
Two, executing on our initiatives to drive revenues and profits; focusing on growth opportunities such as individuals as
investors, our APAC investment management strategy, leveraging our investment services scale to develop highly
effective mid and back office solutions and enhancing our collateral systems and FX trading platforms to provide
clients with better liquidity management tools. And, finally, complying with a host of new capital, liquidity and other

regulatory requirements and doing it as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Now, as I said before, we expect to see the benefits of all these actions to continue to show up in our numbers this year.
With that, let me turn it over to Todd.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review beginning on
page 2. As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.48. The $0.48 includes the $0.14 for the previously disclosed items. It also
includes a benefit of approximately $0.04 between the credit provision which was negative for the period, as well as a
little bit higher than normal investment and other income. So all-in we view it as about a $0.58 quarter.
Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis, total revenue was $3.7 billion. Investment services fees were down
1%. We saw some strength in asset servicing and clearing services, but that was more than offset by the weakness in
issuer services, and we'll talk about that in a minute.
Investment management and performance fees were up 4%, and if you exclude money market fee waivers they were up
5%. FX was down on the lower volatility numbers and NIR was down 5%. Expenses on an adjusted basis were down
4%. So for the quarter, our operating revenues were a little soft, down about 2% year-over-year but we more than offset
that by the decline in expenses enabling us to generate 200 basis points of positive operating leverage. We do expect
the revenue growth rate to recover in the third quarter.
Turning to page 4 where we call out some business metrics that help explain our underlying performance, you can see
that we had record AUM of $1.64 trillion, that's up 15% from a year ago, driven by higher market values as well as
new business. During the quarter, we had net long-term outflows of $13 billion, and short-term outflows of $18 billion.
The long-term outflows were primarily driven by liability driven investments, AUM, where we had one client that
opted to bring that service back in house.
Assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.5 trillion, that's up 9% year-over-year. It primarily
reflects the impact of higher market values, as well as some currency impact. Linked quarter AUC/A was up 2%, due
also to improved market values. For the quarter we had an estimated $130 billion in new AUC/A wins.
Looking into our key metrics, you can see it showed growth year-over-year on most of them. Average loans and
deposits in wealth management and investment services continued their growth trend. The market value on securities
on loan at period end grew and most of our clearing metrics were up, while DARTs volumes were actually down. On
the flip side, DR programs and average tri party balances were down slightly.
In terms of the key external metrics, both equity and fixed income markets were up, but I would point out that fixed
income appreciation trailed the equity market improvement. And as we've discussed before AUM and AUC/A are more
oriented towards fixed income assets.
The FX Volatility Index average was off 37%, the lowest average in a quarter since pre-crisis, impacting FX revenue,
and the average Fed funds effective rate was down 3 basis points or 25% from last year, which had a negative impact
on our money market fee waivers.
Looking at fees on page 6, asset servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year
increase reflects higher market values; it also reflects the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, net new business and organic
growth, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonally higher
SEC lending revenue and higher market values.
Clearing fees were up 2% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by
higher mutual fund fees, partially offset by a decrease in DARTs and higher money market fee waivers.
Issuer services fees were down 21% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower
dividend fees partially due to timing and corporate actions in DRs. In addition, the comparison was impacted by lower

customer reversements in corporate trust as well as higher money market fee waivers and impact of the continuing net
maturities in corporate trust.
The good news, as Gerald indicated, is that we can see the net maturities of structured securities abating in the next 18
month or 24 months as the pace of the maturities slows and the impact of the new business should begin to more than
offset it.
When you look at investment services, you'll see that our investment services fees as a percentage of the non-interest
expense declined from 94% to 93%; however, if you adjust for the money market fee waivers and also the impact of the
issuer services business for the quarter, the ratio actually improved by 1%, demonstrating some operating leverage
there. Investment management and performance fees were up 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially both increases
reflect higher equity market values and the average impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.
The year-over-year increase also reflects net new business which was partially offset by money market fee waivers and
lower performance fees. The sequential increase also reflects lower money market fee waivers and higher performance
fees. Excluding money market fee waivers, investment management and performance fees were up 5% year-over-year
and 3% sequentially.
In FX and other trading, revenue was down 37% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Looking at the
components, FX revenue of $129 million was down 28% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, and that's primarily
reflecting lower volatility, offset by higher volumes.
In fact, if you look at the composite on page 5, you can see that market volatility was down 37% year-over-year and
20% sequentially. So clearly we are capturing higher volumes. Other trading revenue was down $27 million from the
year ago quarter and $5 million from the first quarter. The decrease from the year ago period reflects lower derivatives
trading and the sequential decrease primarily reflects lower fixed income trading.
In the second quarter, we exited one of the derivative business lines, and Curtis and Kurt are considering further actions
to improve the performance of this unit going forward.
Investment and other income was $142 million in the quarter compared with $285 million in the year ago quarter, and
$102 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects a gain related to an equity investment
recorded in the second quarter of 2013, and that was offset by higher other income and seed capital gains. The
sequential increase primarily reflects higher other income, equity investment revenue and asset-related gains which was
partially offset by – we actually had lower lease residual gains in the quarter.
Turning to page 8 of the earnings review, you will see the NIR on an FTE basis was down $35 million versus the year
ago quarter and down $8 million sequentially. The year-over-year decrease resulted from lower yields on investment
securities and that was partially offset by the higher average earning assets which is largely driven by higher deposits.
The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the higher premium amortization on agency mortgage-backed
securities. As you recall from previous quarters when rates do go down, the premium amortization rate actually
increases.
The net interest margin for the quarter was 98 basis points down from 115 basis points a year ago and 105 basis points
in the first quarter.
Turning to page 9, noninterest expense included two nonrecurring items. First was $109 million charge related to the
previously disclosed administration of certain investment management funds, with this charge, we are adequately
reserved for this issue. I would point out that the charges have been broken out in the investment management
disclosure which will enable you to evaluate the segment's results on an actual operating basis. The severance charge of
$120 million related to the streamlining actions which Gerald mentioned in his earlier comments. This charge was
included in the M&I litigation and restructuring line. These actions will benefit our expense run rate in the second half
of this year and I'll give you a little more detail on that in a moment.
Looking at our results adjusted for these items. Total noninterest expenses were down 4% year-over-year and 2%
sequentially. Both decreases were primarily driven by a 5% reduction in staff expense and we were able to do that

despite the impact of increased regulatory risk and control expenses.
The year-over-year decrease also benefited from a 24% reduction in the business development expenses.
On page 2, you can see that at quarter end we had a net unrealized gain on the investment securities portfolio of $1.2
billion. This increase from $676 million at the end of the prior quarter was driven by the lower rates that we saw in the
quarter.
Looking at our loan book on page 11, you can see that the provision for credit losses was a credit during the quarter of
$12 million which was driven by the continued improvement in the credit quality of the book. This compares to a credit
of $19 million a year ago and a credit of $18 million in the first quarter.
Turning to capital on page 12, at June 30, 2014, our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in
under the standardized approach was 10.4% compared to 11.1% at the end of March and under the Advanced Approach
it was 10% compared to 10.7% at the end of the March. The 70 basis points sequential decrease primarily reflects an
increase in risk weighted assets related to the assets of certain consolidated investment management funds. As a
reminder, the fully phased in common equity Tier 1 ratio will be effective in 2019.
Also in the second quarter we exited the new parallel run under the Basel Advanced Approaches and are now required
to perform both standard and advanced transitional calculations. The binding of these ratios is the lower of the
advanced or standard common equity Tier 1 which is currently the advanced at 11.7%. Note that the
quarter-over-quarter decline in our transitional risk based capital ratios has two main components. First of all, the
switch this quarter to using the Advanced Approach methodology is the most significant one, and the impact of the
assets of the consolidated investment management funds I just mentioned also impacted it.
Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio was flat during the quarter at about 4.7% and that's despite a 4% sequential
increase in the average balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased 12.6 million common shares for a total of
$431 million, and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%.
Before moving to some outlook comments, let me spend a few minutes on the two transactions we expect to close in
the third quarter. First of all the sale of our equity investment in Wing Hang actually has already closed in the third
quarter. This quarter's results or next quarter, the third quarter will include an after tax gain of approximately $320
million. Note that our equity investment revenue related to Wing Hang totaled $20 million in the first half of 2014 and
$95 million in 2013. The 2013 numbers includes a gain that we had within a sale of property of about $37 million.
Also the One Wall Street building is expected to be – the closing of it is expected to be done in the third quarter. It will
result in an after tax gain of approximately $200 million, $345 million pre-tax. We have entered into a new lease now
for our new corporate headquarters which we expect to occupy by the end of 2015.
A few points to factor into your thinking about the current quarter and beyond, third quarter earnings are generally
impacted by seasonal downturn in transition volumes and mark-related revenues particularly foreign exchange and
securities lending, while DRs tends to be much stronger in the third quarter.
Two transactions will impact investment and other income going forward. As I noted earlier, the Wing Hang
investment contributed approximately $10 million per quarter to the line item in the first half of the year. In addition,
we recently adopted the accounting standards related to low-income housing. That will result in additional investment
and other income of approximately $15 million per quarter. And that will be offset in the income tax expense. So these
two transactions will increase the lower end of the previous guidance range for this line item by approximately $10. So
we see investment and other income to be in the range of $90 to $100 million on a go forward basis.
In terms of net interest revenue in the second half of this year, we're also planning to reduce our exposure to interbank
placements, assets, so actually reducing the amount of cash that we have there and increase our securities portfolio
inventory of high quality liquid assets. The anticipated revenue is a result of these tactical actions. It should mitigate the
impact of our net interest revenue as a result of the ECB interest rate actions as well as prolonged low reinvestment
rates in the U.S.

Severance charge this quarter will benefit our expense run rate beginning in the second half of the year. We expect the
savings of our streamlining actions to more than offset the impact of the July 1 merit increase. As mentioned earlier, we
expect our headquarter sales to close this quarter. In terms of financial impact, we will see incremental occupancy
expense of $30 million in 2015, as we absorb the rent expense on the new headquarters as well as the expenses of
transitioning out of One Wall Street.
Once we do make that transition and get through the overlap, we expect to see a benefit of our expense base of
approximately $10 million in 2016 and beyond, and that's versus staying here at One Wall Street. In addition, the
proceeds will enable us to pay down nearly $500 million of long-term debt and we'll also receive some benefit from tax
incentives provided by the state of New York. We intend to continue to buy back stock in the third quarter, based on
market conditions. We expect the tax rate to be around 27% for the quarter.
Our focus has been and will continue to be on executing to drive shareholder value. As Gerald said, we're not relying
on market activity to improve. We are continuing to identify ways to increase our efficiency and we are working to
ensure that the actions that we've taken continue to show up in our numbers. With, that let me hand it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Great, thanks, Todd. And Wendy I think we can now open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question today is from Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Good morning. Gerald, you've just come off a sizable expense program. You recently
announced for the expense initiatives that are supposed to begin the second half of this year, yet you found some levers
to pull this quarter as well. So my question is what else are you evaluating today? How quickly can you deliver? And
should we expect this 4% year-over-year decrease to actually build going into the back half of the year or is there some
investment spend taken into consideration as well?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well thanks, Ashley, for the questions. We continuously look at all of our expenses as a way
to try to control them better in recognition of the macro environment that we're in. And rightsizing the size of the
company to the reality of the revenues that are being generated.
So it's a continuous process. That's why we haven't announced any program. We haven't announced any separate
initiative. It's day in and day out reducing the expenses and improving our operations and efficiency. We feel good
about what we've achieved so far in the first half of this year. We're looking to do more in the second half. The
severance cost that we're taking this quarter, the run rate will improve and offset the normal merit increase in the
second half of this year. So I feel good about going into the second half in terms of continuing to control expenses well.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Got it. And then can you remind us of what your ROE and ROTE targets are and give us a
sense of where you think you can go without any help from rates and how quickly you think you can get there?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, we had indicated a few years back that our target on ROE was about 10% and
return on tangible common equity would be substantially higher than that. So for the second quarter, return on tangible
common equity was about 18%. We think we can continue – in the first quarter we're going to be around 8% and 18%.
We think we can continue to grind that up into that 10% range without a significant move with rates or volatility.
Obviously, if we saw a move, and better market conditions here, then we would see a much more significant jump.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: All right. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thanks, Ashley.

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks Ashley.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alex Blostein>: Thanks, guys. Good morning. A quick follow-up on the numbers I guess on expenses and then a
bigger picture question after. So lots of moving pieces. You guys announced additional measures and you just
highlighted obviously some of the benefits will come in next six months or so [ph] in comp (30:23). But I guess if you
look at the expense base overall, $2.7 billion-ish run rate in the quarter today like ex some of the one-timers, is that a
fair run rate? Do you guys expect to grow that as the business continues to grow or is this kind of the run rate in
expenses we should think about over the next 6 months to 12 months as you realize some of these savings albeit offset
by some of the growth initiatives?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Alex, it's Todd. We're working real hard to try to maintain this expense level or keep it
from growing. So that the actions that we've taken around the head count, the actions that we've taken around
occupancy, the very careful analysis of all of our discretionary spend, we want to try to keep overall expenses flat and
some of the benefit of that we're using to invest in some of the new revenue streams that Gerald has talked about. But
all in all, there can obviously be some noise in those numbers. We're trying to keep it as flat as we can.
<Q - Alex Blostein>: Got it, that is helpful. The second question just on the current environment. Over the last three to
four months or so we're seeing increased pressure on the bigger banks to shrink the balance sheets to get faster
compliance with SLR. You're seeing that resonate in the repo markets, declining 10%-ish or so year over year. Just
curious to think about how that impacts your business holistically. You guys are obviously a big tri-party repo manager.
Just curious to see how that flows through to your operations? And just overall given the fact that you are a big
counterparty to a lot of the banks on Wall Street, is that having any sort of impact on the business overall?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes, Alex great question. Certainly some of our largest clients are shrinking their balance
sheets and reducing their repo positions. So what's interesting is our tri-party repo program has essentially been flat. So
as the dealers in the U.S. have shrunk the marketplace, the global tri-party program has increased. So we're able to
maintain the revenues and the profitability in the business and get a good return on the investments we've made in the
tri-party repo reform program. There's no question that as the big dealers in the U.S. shrink their activities, there's some
impact on our revenue streams there but we are making up for it through enhanced services and capabilities in other
places like collateral services.
Collateral services, as you may recall, was originally designed for the sell side. The buy side is the one that's going to
start using it much more heavily. And so we feel very good about our position and being able to offset the declines in
the large broker dealers with more activity from other clients.
<Q - Alex Blostein>: Got it. Great. Thanks so much, guys.

Thank you, the next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, two questions. First on the corporate trust, you indicated that you went through the
review and decided to retain it. Could you just give us a little bit more color on the ins and outs into that decision?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure, Betsy, thanks for the question. When we said in May when we made more public that
we were exploring this, we said at the time that unless someone was willing to pay us a premium value for this
business, we wouldn't sell it, because we like the business, we like the attributes of it, it's a fee-based business. It has
future upside potential with a more normalized monetary policy and has structured notes and mortgage-backed
securities come back on. We see light at the end of the tunnel.

We would only sell it if, in fact, someone would pay us the premium what we thought the value of this business is
worth. It's a challenging environment for someone to acquire something of this size and complexity. And so we decided
that we couldn't get the kind of premium that we thought this business was worth, and we think it's much more valuable
in our hands and we can continue to build upon it and leverage it and it's a great business. And that's why I said we've
always liked it. It was only a question of whether it was more valuable to someone else than versus us.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So, I mean, obviously the Street knows there's increased activism in the company, and
I guess the underlying question is, was this undertaken in part to answer questions to those folks or were you able to get
to higher ROE, ROTCE expectations via the work that you're doing now on the expense side?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, the consideration to begin with started a long time ago. So let's start with that. Our
board has always been very active and we as a management team have been very active in looking at all of our
portfolio businesses and making sure that they are best held in our hands versus someone else. And our corporate trust
in some ways, it was a simple math in a low interest rate environment with a level of deposits that were generated, if
someone could make better use of those deposits and get a better margin on it and pay us a premium for the business,
that's when we would consider it.
To the extent that someone couldn't take advantage of it, we're happy to have the business and to continue to own it and
grow it and it's a leading market share business. So, that was the core reason for that. We think we can achieve our
capital ratios, our leverage ratios, our liquidity coverage ratios all within our own means, irrespective of retaining the
corporate trust business.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. And then just separately kind of ties into the collateral management question earlier,
but as the Fed starts to – well ends tapering and then starts to increase the reverse repo program, obviously you are in
the middle of that and with money market funds management product you've got as well as with the tri-party exposure
that you've got, maybe you're in a unique position to give us some color on how you think that higher increased RRP
program is going to impact the financial markets?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, I'll start with part of the answer and then I'll turn it over to Todd. Todd has become a
student of this as well Curtis. We are the vehicle through which the reverse repo program of the Fed is – we're the
mechanism for allowing it to happen in the marketplace or for them to put the program in place. So the Fed is a client
of ours in that regard and so we do see the activity running through us and we're not going to violate any confidences
there. But, I think it is certainly one of the tools in the Fed's tool box in terms of managing monetary policy and interest
rates. And so maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Todd or Curtis.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes, I would just add, Betsy, given the new liquidity and capital rules, it's going to be
difficult for the Fed to do open market transactions the way they've done them in the past, hence the reverse repo
program where they go directly to money market funds, came into place. I think there is some question about just how
much the Fed wants to expand that program, and obviously if they do expand it, they would do it through the tri-party
repos, so we do see that activity.
The other alternative that they have to increasing interest rates or a drain is to either sell some of the assets that they
have or increase the interest rate that they pay on excess reserves or on this term deposit facility that they have in the
banking system. So if they do reverse repo, the cash will come out of the banking system, and it will go into the money
market funds based on price, and then the banking system would have to bid against that. Some of the cash that went
into those funds would come back into the banking system. But I think it's about – it's kind of that simple. As reverse
repo grows, the excess reserves should decline.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi, thanks very much. So the actions that you described taken to offset some of the lower
rates and the actions in Europe, I'm curious if you feel that has any material change on your asset sensitivity once all
the changes are in motion. I heard you on the revenue neutrality but just curious on what that means in the rising rate
environment in the U.S.?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes, as you can tell from our NIR position, we've taken a bit of a defensive stance. We've
actually reduced our asset sensitivity substantially from where we were last year. We do pay for that a little bit on our
NIM, there's no question about it. There will be a little bit of an increase as we do make that transition, Glenn. I don't
think it will be significant. It will be in the vicinity of about 10%. So our sensitivity would increase about 5% to 10%.
And we will be users of the held-to-maturity account as well. So there's less sensitivity to the capital ratios.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got it. Okay, cool. And speaking of the capital ratios, just looking for a drop more color on
what specifically got consolidated from asset management to produce the drop in the ratios? And I'm just curious on
timing on why it happened this quarter. I'm just not familiar with it.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. We actually consolidated some of the CLOs that one of our asset managers
managed, actually quite a few of the CLOs. So as we transition from Basel I to Basel III, we actually reviewed the
treatment of those consolidated assets and we determined that even though we have no economic risk to them, we have
no credit exposure at all, that they should be included in our risk weighted assets. We actually expect this might be a
temporary item, FASB has just recently discussed the possibility of adapting a new standard that could be adopted as
early next year and it would lead to us probably deconsolidating some or even most of these assets as early as next
year.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Last one for me is just the 24% decline in business development cost. Is there a
business component to it that impact or is that more of a sustainable decline because it really moved the needle?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, there are two major components and there are a couple, but I'd say the two major
components in there, Glenn, is our marketing expenses and our travel and entertainment expenses. We've been much
more aggressive in managing our – those discretionary expenses. For example, we have discouraged internal travel.
We've encouraged increased use of video and audio conferencing. And so rather than pull some of our operating
committee together from time to time, we are doing it virtually much more frequently. And we are doing that across the
board. We are not decreasing important revenue producing travel. This is internal related travel.
Also last year, we had a substantial campaign on our marketing and branding efforts, and we have reduced the spend
associated with that. We are going to try to keep this discipline and sustain these levels. Now, there is some seasonality
to this, with conferences and so forth. So we would expect the third quarter is typically pretty good, and the fourth
quarter tends to be a little bit higher.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Thank you for all that.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks, Glenn.

Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Todd, one follow-up on the NII, outside of the puts and takes,
can you also tell us whether or not you think you can actually maintain this current level of NII? Your comments were
more focused on the offsets between extending versus the drags from ECB but what's going on underneath that
surface?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I think we will be able to, as we model this out, and obviously it's going to be a bit
sensitive to interest rates, but as we go through our modeling here, I think in the next few quarters we will be able to
maintain the level at this rate or in the ballpark of this rate, maybe slightly higher.

<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. Two questions on investment servicing, just core asset servicing ex securities lending
was up only slightly sequentially but it was up 4% year-over-year. I'm just curious if you can walk us through trends
underlying the asset servicing. You did have AUC growth and I get that you're not as much of an equity sensitive
custodian but is this only a $5 million kind of core increase in servicing? Can you give us some flavor for the growth or
the traction of growth that is underneath that?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes, Ken, it's Gerald. Just a couple comments there. One, you'll recall we did lose a couple
of clients over the course of the last 12 months. Those losses are now in the full run rate, and that's why you've seen a
softness in some of the asset servicing revenues. That's now fully in the run rate and we think we feel good about the
pipeline in the go forward. We're attracting good clients, and so it's a little bit soft this quarter, but we expect it to pick
up in the future.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. And my last one, just about issuer services, and you point out the drags of both sides
of the business, but second quarter is typically a seasonally stronger one that leads to the bigger jump in the third. So
can you also just walk us through corporate trust and ADRs and the drivers there?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. So issuer services on a year-over-year basis, I think it was down more than $60
million. Part of what we saw in the second quarter was last year we saw a little more dividend action in the second
quarter, and due to timing, we're going to see some of that in the third quarter. So we would expect the third quarter to
show the typical bounce that we get in seasonality around DRs, probably even a little bit higher than typical. So that
was one of the reasons for softness there. And the other reason is we also had fewer of these kind of pass-through
where some of our technology investments in corporate trust have paid for clients, and we see that in the revenue, as
well as in the expense line. We had a little bit less of that.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. To, as you say, reduced structural costs, maybe you need to further reduce the structure, and
at the annual meeting, I asked about the merits of having both asset serving along with asset management, and Gerald,
you said that you have done the work, and my thought is perhaps you need to show your work because the way we look
at it, the reported ROE has not been over the target of 10% since at least 2009, and so if this is a superior structure,
shouldn't there at least be an ROE in the double digits?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, Mike, just as I said at the shareholder meeting, it's a business we like a lot. We think
there is a lot of good benefits with the two businesses together. Investment management is a great contributor to our
earnings, it's capital light, it's fee based. We're getting collaboration across the businesses. We learn from each other.
We are collaborating on new products, new services and new capabilities. When he we've done the math, as I said at
the annual meeting, we don't think the math works. There's a lot of tax challenges, a lot of regulatory challenges
associated with it. We are, in fact, improving the margins both in investment services and in investment management.
And that was evident this quarter.
In investment management you saw a 2% improvement year-over-year in the margins and the business while we're still
investing in it. So we think we can improve the returns and the margins and drive a great business together. We like the
diversity of the earnings. We like the fact that they mutually service the same clients. I think it is a great combination.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I have three follow-up questions. Should I ask one and then re-queue or ask all three now?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Ideally one now and then re-queue, Mike.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. So what is the dollar amount of synergies, and to repeat what I said before, again if this is
such a good combination, why has the ROE been below the cost of capital for the last five years?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: So, Curtis, maybe you want to touch base a little bit on some of the synergies.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yes. So, Mike, I think that when you think about investment management, we're serving the
same clients in so many cases that are clients in our investment services business. You've asked for a very specific
number. Truthfully, what ends up happening is these clients become clients of both parts of our organization, but it's
this continuous ability to connect to the investment services clients that's just such a powerful part of investment
management. Let me give you, just in this quarter, a couple of examples.
We had a foundation, a client of the investment servicing business that expressed an interest in expanding their
portfolio in the direction of direct lending investment vehicles, that the team that covers them from investment services
was well aware of our capabilities in this space, introduced us to that client, and it became a win for us in terms of
getting an investment management mandate.
Another part of the investment services business that's been a real winner for us in the last several months has been
offering our private banking services to the clients at Pershing. So the financial advisors that Pershing serves, many of
them don't have access to their own private banking activities. So we have linked those two, actually invested in having
a team in our private bank, make lending available to them and have seen nearly $0.5 billion dollars of loan volume
over a pretty short time, and actually on really what we call the pilot effort that we are now actually expanding to make
it a much bigger part of the business.
If you look at our cash business today, because we're in a low interest rate environment, the overall economics of the
cash business are not nearly what we think the contingent opportunity is in a more normalized rate environment, but
just think of all the changes that occurred in the money market fund world. The question was asked earlier about the
basic change in market structure. We think we're very well positioned to provide services around cash products and at a
higher rate environment, that will be very valuable to the shareholders of BNY Mellon. So, those are just some
examples of the places where there is real synergy.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. I'll re-queue. Thanks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. So I guess I am just – I'm a little bit confused about why you would want to
give up your asset sensitivity or lose some of the asset sensitivity here. I mean the NIM currently at like roughly 100
basis points is far from heroic. We've got Yellen making comments that rates might be moving higher. So can you help
us understand what drove that decision a little bit with a little bit greater clarity?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: So you're talking about moving a little bit of the cash that we have in the form of
placements into high quality liquid assets. Part of that is compliance with LCR. So we are sitting on a massive amount
of cash. Placements are not LCR compliant, so this is a fairly easy way for us to comply and we will generate a little bit
of additional NIR.
We don't want to give up much of our interest rate sensitivity, so you're not going to see a significant move there. We
do think that there's both an opportunity cost and a capital cost to doing that, Brennan, but you will see a modest
adjustment.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes, and Brennan, some of the other activities we're working on, you've seen the loan book
on our wealth management business grow. We like that sort of asset, you see some of our secured financing for some of
our collateral management clients increase. We are looking at other areas within our asset capabilities to generate better

returns on those assets and still keep the interest rate sensitivity available to us for when rates do improve.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for that color. And then if we think about your asset management business
and the sort of adjusted pre-tax margin there, if we look at what happened last year in that business, it contracted about
100 basis points versus 2012. And I understand that the majority of that was investments in distribution. But if we look
at other asset management firms, they saw a rather significant expansion in margins last year. So I guess what's holding
back the asset management business, given how constructive the market is? Is there a structural impediment there?
Does it have something to do with how the agreements with the affiliates are structured? If you can maybe help us
understand that a little bit, that'd be great.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yes, Brennan, it's Curtis. So first of all, let me tell you that last year in addition to the
investments that we made to grow our Wealth Management business, to expand our reach to financial intermediaries,
financial advisors through, primarily in the U.S. through Dreyfus and also to grow geographically. Those investments,
they certainly dampen margin. But I also would call out the fact that we had a pretty meaningful fee waiver
environment. So we have a big part of our business is absolutely impacted by low short rates.
When you compare our overall enterprise to other peers that are sort of over the $1 trillion mark, we have a
substantially smaller percentage of assets that are in the equity asset class. And I would also point out that our equity
AUM is also pretty diversified, a lot less as a percent is U.S. equities, which had an especially good year last year.
So while it was certainly a tailwind for us, it was not the nearly the tailwind that it would have been for investment
firms that are less diversified and more singularly exposed to equity AUM. I don't think that the boutique structure,
certainly each one of our investment firms is very focused on their client base, their asset classes, they have a wide
array of their own activities both institutional and through retail distribution channels, but I actually think that they
benefit from the scale. We have firms that are 30, 40, 50 people, highly focused on a very specific asset class and we
give them geographic reach in terms of clients. We have a firm on the East Coast of the United States that's raised
money all over Asia and throughout the sovereign wealth fund world without having to actually build their own
infrastructure to do that.
So I think it's a – we are pretty excited about it. We are investing in it, and we are absolutely focused on improving
margins. It's why we are investing where we are. If you look at the peers who have higher margins than us, they
generally have a substantially larger percentage of their assets in the retail space and they have a larger share currently.
They are benefiting from the equity tailwind. Of course that creates more profit volatility and margin volatility, if you
look at it through time. But we are investing to improve our margins and are pretty excited about our opportunities
there.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes, just one final bit of color. I think you're seeing evidence of it in the 200 basis point
improvement in margin year-over-year. This year and early next year are sort of the high watermarks in terms of the
level of investment. And we showed you in April the expected improvement in margin as those investments start to pay
off. I also might add the investments we are making are not high risk investments. It's investing in wholesalers and
distribution; it's investing in wealth managers who are bringing in clients. It is starting to show up in our numbers now.
So these are investments we have very, very high confidence on the return.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for the color.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.

<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Good morning. Just back to the corporate trust on the expense side of this. So can you just talk
a little bit about – to what degree some of the consolidations of those platforms were involved in the prior cost
reduction program, and whether that dynamic changed upon your decision and then so should we be thinking about any
other further back office consolidations as a potential expense save on the corporate trust now that you're keeping it?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, the primary operating platform for corporate trust is a trust accounting system and it's
really dedicated to corporate trust. They are the last users of it. And, actually, we were in a migration mode to our end
state platform called GSP, for those of you who are interested in acronyms. We were in the process of doing that
conversion. We're going to continue that process, and it should be completed next year. And so there's no change in that
going forward. And we will realize better operating metrics as a result of it.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Okay. So that's – so no change to your sort of expense view based on you keeping that?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Brian, you're breaking up if you...
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: I'm sorry, no change in the expense view based on your keeping that is the takeaway there?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: No, not at all.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: And then on the revenue side, maybe a question for Curtis and Brian – and congrats on your
expanded roles by the way – on the clearing business, the revenue held up well given DARTs definitely declined in the
quarter, so just wondering if that was due to the component that's related to licensing and asset management? Or are
you gaining new clients and is the run rate better there? And then similarly for Curtis, the organic growth has been very
strong in asset management recently; this quarter a little bit weaker. Maybe if you could just address the LDI outflow
and your view of sort of organic growth coming in the next one to two quarters overall.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: So Brian, it's Brian Shea. I will start with the clearing question and then I'll turn it over to
Curtis. The clearing business has been pretty solid with core fee growth driven by significant growth in mutual fund
assets and asset based fees offset by higher cash [ph] and interest fee (58:00) waivers and lower DARTs as you
recognized.
I think the underlying metrics behind the clearing business is overall really pretty strong and this quarter we have a
record level of client assets in custody. We have a record number of total individual investments on our platforms
globally, we have record levels of mutual fund assets on our platform overall. And growing margin balances as you can
see in the metrics year-over-year and despite lots of low rates and discussions about money market industry, pretty
solid cash management balances and I would note, actually to reinforce Curtis' point that the mark share, Pershing
client's choosing, because they decide which cash management alternatives they'll use, but the clients have chosen
Dreyfus more than ever before, and so we have a record level of market share of Dreyfus cash management on the
Pershing platform.
Again, when an interest rate environment changes that will be a much more valuable linkage and synergy between the
investment management and investment services business. So that's my perspective on clearing. I will turn it over to
Curtis.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yes, on the organic side, first of all, I would tell you that we had long-term outflows this
quarter of $13 billion. It's a pretty unique situation, actually, in that one of our large LDI clients actually decided to take
their LDI activities in house. So it was not any way related to our investment performance or our service. We always
hate losing any business, but completely understand the decision that they made to do that. I will tell that you our
pipelines around LDI specifically continue to be robust. Pension de-risking is still very much alive and well and I
would say it's expanding geographically. So our largest business is Insight, which has a large book of U.K. LDI
business and I can tell you that the global interest in LDI is definitely not shrinking.
One of the nice things about – just since we are talking about Insight, I will tell you that the Insight – the tools you have
to be able to appropriately model the liabilities especially, U.K. liabilities that have an inflation sensitivity component,
you have to be very good at understanding market dynamics and what drives risk and return. And in the quarter Insight
specifically actually had a very significant amount of inflow into alternative strategies, absolute return strategies, where

they're taking a lot of their capabilities and creating absolute return products that their clients have been very satisfied
with them in the LDI space are allocating money to them and also getting a broader interest.
We like the – on the short term side, like the rest of the industry, we did experience outflows. Our outflows we think
are roughly in line with what the industry saw in the second quarter, both – some of it being tax payments and some of
it being that clients were certainly in the beginning of the quarter, reallocating out short-term cash into somewhat
higher yielding assets and actually that's the story in the fixed income as well. Our outflow there is related to mostly
short duration fixed income, what clients are reallocating.
In equities, the dynamic there has really been three things, the equity rebalancing. So the increase in equity markets has
caused clients to move money, but we have also seen clients move assets around into asset strategies. So in this quarter
you actually will see our increase of $7 billion was almost entirely equity index. So it's nice when you have a diverse
range of products to be able to – it's leaving one place and going another. Money in motion is a big part of our
advantage here.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Great, great. Thanks very much for the thorough answer.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Wendy, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is with Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: Hi. Thanks a lot. So just getting back to the expense management, you and others have been
mentioning for a while the pressure of compliance costs. And I am just wondering looking ahead do you see those
leveling off? Is that a pressure that you feel is abating so that to the extent you do streamlining, more of it will fall to
the bottom line? And the same question on I guess the combining of your platforms, is there upfront IT for that?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Okay. Great question, Cynthia. So first, on the regulatory side, the rate of increase is slowing
down as we're getting greater clarity around the rules and the regulations and what we need to do to be in compliance
with them. But importantly, we cannot sacrifice having a well-controlled, well-risk managed firm. We are absolutely
committed to that, and we are not going to sacrifice having a great firm in those categories. But we do, in fact, see the
rate of growth moderating. And our expense management is taking into consideration, continuing to fund those
activities and so that's why we're very diligent around all the other things that we can control so that we can fund new
investments, we can fund having a well-controlled environment, and continue to grow our businesses and serve our
clients well. So it's all factored into the expense control programs that we put in place.
<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: And on IT...
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: ... consolidations, again the technology investments that we're making are factored into the
expense base and we're realizing the synergies that are the platform consolidations and it's in the run rate.
<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks Cynthia.
Gerald L. Hassell
