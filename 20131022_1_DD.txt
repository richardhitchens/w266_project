MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Dawn, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the DuPont quarterly investor call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After
the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time,
management requests that limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, and please pick up your handset to
allow optimal sound quality. If you have additional questions, you may reenter the queue.
Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Carl Lukach, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Carl, you may begin your conference.
Carl J. Lukach

During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to slide two for
our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.
Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a
number of risks and assumptions. We urge to you review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially.
We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements
provided with our earnings news release and on the website.
For today's agenda, Ellen will start with opening comments. Nick will review our third quarter financial performance
and near-term outlook, and I'll provide business segment insights. We'll conclude with Ellen's comments, followed by
your questions.
With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Great, thank you, Carl, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
I'm pleased to begin today by highlighting DuPont's third quarter performance. Our segment results were generally in
line with our July expectations. Double-digit earnings improvements from Performance Materials, Electronics &
Communications, Safety & Protection, and Industrial Biosciences, paired with ongoing productivity initiatives across
the company helped to offset the expected earnings decline from our Performance Chemicals segment.
Operating earnings of $0.45 per share were above our guidance due to a one point reduction in the annual tax rate,
gains related to our Pannar acquisition and a joint venture asset, both of which we expected in the fourth quarter.
However, the strength of the dollar was a greater headwind than we expected. As a result, we realized a higher portion
of the second half operating earnings in the third quarter than the 40% we anticipated in July.
Third quarter net sales of $7.7 billion increased 5%, largely due to 9% higher volumes versus a weak prior year.
As you may recall, one of DuPont's three operating priorities is to drive growth in developing markets. Against that
metric, we delivered solid third quarter results. In developing Asia, we increased sales by 14% compared to last year's
difficult economic environment.
Our investments in research and development and market-facing resources continue to pay strong dividends. To
illustrate that point, our Performance Materials business delivered 29% higher automotive sales volumes in China this
quarter. This progress was due in part to insights from our innovation centers, our local application development
capability, and our customer focus teams.
We also delivered a 24% revenue increase in developing Europe, Middle East, and Africa, which was broad-based and
aided by the acquisition of a controlling interest in Pannar Seed in Africa. This acquisition is another positive step to
enhance agricultural productivity and improve food security while accelerating the development of higher performing
products for Africa's farmers.
Looking more broadly, the macroeconomic environment and in particular global industrial production is improving
sequentially, but at a slower pace than we expected three months ago. As a result, we recently lowered our global
industrial production outlook for 2013 from 2.5% growth to slightly under 2%. Despite the slow growth
macroeconomic environment, we continue to capitalize on our unique scientific capabilities to develop differentiated
high-value solutions that respond to growing global market demands.
In summary, our strong and diverse global footprint positioned us well to deliver strong volume growth compared to
last year, and we are executing well against our strategic and operating priorities.

Nick will now explain in more detail our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of the
year. Nick?
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on slide three.
Our operating earnings for the third quarter were $0.45 per share, slightly better than expectations and $0.02 better than
2012. The improvement primarily reflects the acceleration of two events which were expected to occur in the fourth
quarter of this year, an equity remeasurement gain related to the Pannar acquisition of about $0.03 per share and a
benefit of about $0.02 per share relating to an asset revaluation in a joint venture.
These positive items along with the benefit of a one point reduction in our full-year base tax rate were somewhat
tempered by a stronger U.S. dollar and the anticipated lower Performance Chemicals operating earnings of about $0.13
per share. The lower Performance Chemicals earnings are largely due to the decline in global TiO2 prices versus prior
year. We are seeing clear signs that this market has stabilized, and we are encouraged by improving industry
fundamentals.
Consolidated net sales of $7.7 billion increased 5% versus the prior year. Volume increased 9%, led by our Electronics
& Communications, Performance Chemicals, and Agricultural segments, which each had double-digit volume growth
versus a weak third quarter last year. On a sequential basis, volumes were up only slightly compared with the second
quarter.
Local selling prices declined 3%, primarily due to lower TiO2 and fluoro product prices and lower pass-through of
precious metal costs in Electronics & Communications, partially offset by innovation-driven price increases in our
Agricultural segment.
Currency also had a negative 1% impact on our top line, as the dollar continued to strengthen against most currencies,
particularly the Brazilian real, Japanese yen, and the Indian rupee, partially offset by a weaker dollar versus the euro.
For the full year, we now expect a negative $0.18 currency impact. This is higher than our previous outlook of $0.12 to
$0.14 because, during the year, the dollar has strengthened considerably versus every key currency except the euro.
In addition to our business performance, our base tax rate for the quarter was seven points lower than last year,
contributing $0.04 to operating EPS. For the full year, we now expect a base tax rate of about 22%.
Now let's turn to slide four for more information regarding the company sales by geographic region.
In every region of the world, we had increased sales volumes. However, lower local prices were an offsetting factor.
The decline in prices in the quarter generally reflected the impact of our Performance Chemicals businesses in the
regions, particularly in developed Asia. Our growth in developing EMEA reflects our acquisition of controlling interest
in Pannar Seed, which significantly increased our footprint in South Africa during the quarter.
In the second quarter earnings call, we communicated our expectations that industrial markets would gradually recover.
As Ellen noted, we still expect to see industrial production improvements, but they're coming at a slower pace. In the
third quarter, we saw growth in Europe and Japan after 2011 and 2012 recessions, and we saw some positive signs of
growth in China. Overall, we see the global economy improving, but slowly.
Now let's take a deeper look into our operating earnings for the third quarter. Slide five provides a segment operating
earnings variance analysis. From this waterfall chart, you can see clearly the large impact the decline in Performance
Chemicals segment earnings had on our overall earnings compared to last year. Operating earnings for Performance
Chemicals declined $159 million this quarter. The $0.13 per share hurt was in line with our expectations. Performance
Materials, Electronics & Communications, Safety & Protection, and Industrial Biosciences each had strong
performance and double-digit percent growth versus the prior year, offsetting much of the decline in Performance
Chemicals segment earnings. Carl will cover more of our operating segment results in a few minutes.

Moving to slide six, in total, segment earnings were down $0.05 per share. Segment results include the Performance
Chemicals decline we just covered. And they also include $0.04 hurt due to currency, which was higher than we
anticipated. A change in the base tax rate expectation for the full year also provided a $0.04 benefit in the quarter.
The $0.01 benefit from lower corporate expenses that you see on slide six reflects this quarter's savings from cost
control in our business support functions and the restructuring program we announced last year. We are on track to
deliver the $300 million in savings we targeted for 2013.
Beyond this restructuring program, we continue to execute ongoing cost productivity initiatives throughout all of our
businesses. We are well on our way to delivering on our commitment of more than $300 million for the full year from
these initiatives. In total, both initiatives will contribute significantly to offsetting inflation and helping to fund our
growth investments.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash on slide seven, our current free cash flow is about $2 billion greater use of
cash versus the prior year. As you know, cash flows are highly seasonal from our growing Ag segment. And with sales
up more than $1 billion in the segment this year, cash and working capital investments have increased to support that
growth year over year. The timing of production grower compensation payments, which reflected higher contract
commodity prices from last year, and the timing of customer prepayments, contributed to the working capital increases.
The decline in Performance Chemicals earnings also had a negative impact on free cash flow versus last year.
Before I close, let me offer a few insights regarding our balance sheet and pensions. First, a reminder; maintaining a
strong balance sheet that provides the financial flexibility to fund ongoing operations and compelling growth
opportunities remains a key priority for DuPont. Second, our current unfunded pension balance is declining. Given
today's rising interest rate environment, and if all other pension related variables were to remain constant, our unfunded
pension liability should decline significantly, by about $2 billion to $3 billion by year-end.
In summary, third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and our lower base tax rate offset the currency
headwinds. With these results, we are today reaffirming our full-year outlook of $3.85 per share. We expect an
improved fourth quarter compared to last year's weak operating results and also anticipate that our Ag segment will
have positive earnings, reflective of the seasonal shifts that Carl will discuss in more detail. Additionally, our outlook
also reflects a year-over-year currency headwind of about $0.07 per share and dials in a full-year base tax rate of about
22%, lower than our previous assumption of 23% to 24%.
In closing, we have delivered strong results in the quarter and for the year. We will overcome more than $0.80 of
headwinds due to Performance Chemicals earnings and currency. Our teams continue to execute well against our plans,
and we continue to create increased value for our shareholders. In the coming months, we expect to deliver a strong
finish to the year.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Carl.
Carl J. Lukach
Thanks, Nick. I'd like to now provide some brief segment insights. As a reminder, the slides and the complete segment
commentary are posted on the Investor Center website at DuPont.com. Please turn now to slide eight, and let's begin
with Agriculture segment.
We feel great about our results and our performance in this competitive environment. Year to date, we've grown sales
12% and operating earnings 8% over last year's strong performance. Our Right Product, Right Acre strategy in Seeds
and our innovation focus is delivering value to customers. In the third quarter, sales grew 15%, based on strong demand
for our industry-leading insecticides and higher seed revenues. Our typical seasonal loss was lower than last year as
sales growth and a gain of $26 million from the Pannar Seed acquisition more than offset higher seed costs.
In Crop Protection, third quarter sales were up 21%, with volume growth in Latin America led by strong demand for
Rynaxypyr. Expectations for higher soybean hectares also drove demand for fungicides, particularly picoxystrobin.

Rynaxypyr continues to perform well, and we are on pace to exceed $900 million in sales this year. Our fungicide
portfolio also continues to show solid growth, with the highly successful launch of Aproach, our picoxystrobin
fungicide product in the United States, this year.
Moving to the Seed business, we had a solid start to the Latin America sales season despite the negative impact of
currency and growers reducing corn hectares in favor of soybeans. Pricing gains were led by the continued adoption of
Intrasect, our dual-mode-of-action insect-protected hybrids, which will represent about a third of our Brazil corn
volume this year. Likewise, recent investments in soybeans are paying off, as growers in Brazil are increasing demand
for locally developed, high-yielding, high-quality Pioneer brand soybeans.
The USDA did not issue an October crop report and won't issue its final 2013 acreage report until January 2014, so it's
too early to be definitive about market share. However, we are pleased with the competitive performance of the Pioneer
business, growing sales 11% through the first three quarters, based on the strength of price gains and higher corn
volumes in North America.
Moving to the fourth quarter outlook for Agriculture, we expect a substantial increase in sales on expectations of
continued strong performance in both Seeds and Crop Protection in Latin America, earlier shipment of safrinha corn
seed, enabled by recent investments in Brazil, an early start to North America seed shipments, and a benefit from
including our Pannar acquisition.
As a result of sales increases in Seeds, continued growth in Crop Protection, and lower anticipated seed input costs for
fourth quarter North American sales, we expect to achieve a small fourth quarter profit in our Agriculture segment for
the first time. For the full year, we now expect operating margins will be about flat, overcoming the impact of the
higher seed input costs earlier in the year.
Looking forward to 2014, we are watching closely corn and soybean markets and implications for the upcoming
safrinha and Northern Hemisphere planting seasons. Several important events will play out between now and when
growers put seed in the ground next spring in North America. Specifically, we will see the completion of the North
American harvest this year, the harvest of the summer crop in South America, and the planting of the safrinha corn in
Brazil.
Turning to Electronics & Communications on slide nine, the demand environment strengthened versus the prior year in
photovoltaics, and this was reflected in our improved results. Operating earnings increased 67%, due primarily to
higher demand for our Solamet and Kevlar materials in PV. Overall, PV market fundamentals are gradually improving.
Module prices have been stable due to improved utilization rates, and the settlement of trade disputes has provided a
more stable environment.
Global PV demand continues to be led by China, Japan, and the United States, partially offset by lower demand in
Europe. While the PV market is still challenged by the weak underlying financials of many players in the industry, the
long-term outlook is positive because PV prices are reaching grid parity in more of the world. Our strategy is to
continue to build our position as the premier PV materials supplier by stressing the importance of selecting high-value,
high-efficiency materials to extend the life of PV systems, which will assist the industry in its drive towards grid parity.
For our Industrial Biosciences segment on slide 10 this year, our sales and operating earnings have grown each quarter,
and third quarter operating earnings of $45 million were up 13%.
On slide 11, for Nutrition & Health, we continue to see strong demand for cultures and probiotics, and we delivered
good results in protein solutions.
Moving ahead to Performance Chemicals on slide 12, the 25% year-over-year TiO2 volume growth in the third quarter
was another positive step in the recovery. We have now recorded three consecutive quarters of year-over-year and
sequential volume growth. Additionally, all regions delivered double-digit volume improvements. Europe and Asia
were particularly strong.
While fourth quarter segment earnings are still expected to be modestly lower, this represents a significant
improvement compared to the 51% decline we experienced through the first three quarters. We see industry

fundamentals improving and our strong manufacturing technology advantages remaining intact.
For Performance Materials on slide 13, third quarter results benefited from higher volumes in automotive, electronics,
and packaging markets. Year to date, we have delivered three consecutive quarters of earnings growth, accompanied by
increases in operating margins.
Finally, in Safety & Protection on slide 14, we are seeing volume improvements in U.S. ballistics military protection,
certain industrial segments, garments, and construction. Our targeted efforts to drive demand generation coupled with
ongoing productivity measures are delivering results and improving our financial performance. Third quarter earnings
were up 16% versus last year, and we now have delivered three consecutive quarters of operating margin growth in this
segment.
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Great, thank you, Carl. Now I'd like to provide some insights on our earnings expectations, and I'll conclude with an
update regarding the strategic evaluation of Performance Chemicals.
As Nick highlighted, we do anticipate our full-year earnings will be about $3.85 per share. To put that in perspective,
we expect to have a full-year headwind from the combined impact of lower Performance Chemicals earnings and
negative currency of more than $0.80 per share. Excluding these factors, our full-year earnings per share increase will
be 24% higher than last year in a slow growth global economy. While we maintain a cautionary macroeconomic stance,
it's noteworthy to highlight that we do expect fourth quarter earnings should more than double from last year's weak
results.
For 2014 planning, we are now beginning our business-by-business goal setting and execution review work. Across the
portfolio, we initiate this process with the macro assumption that global economies will continue to gradually improve
from this year's sluggish industrial production base. To meet our future commitments, we will drive performance across
the company by remaining focused on our three strategic operating priorities. They are increasing return on research
and development, capitalizing on our global reach, and driving execution while delivering on our productivity
commitments.
First, we will deploy our science to meet today's customers' needs, build a strong and balanced pipeline of new
products, and increase the return on our research and development investments. Second, we will build on our strong
third quarter performance in emerging markets and capitalize on our global reach. And third, we will execute against
our commitments to drive productivity and deliver cost savings that will help offset inflation and fund growth
initiatives.
On the innovation front, we successfully delivered 470 new products to meet customer needs in the third quarter alone.
Examples of our innovation this quarter included: new applications of Kevlar aramid fibers for high-strength durable
conveyor belts for Safety & Protection; new branded probiotics designed for pediatric nutrition from our Nutrition &
Health segment; and new product blends of Axtra enzymes from Industrial Biosciences, designed to reduce costs and
improve nutrition in animal feed applications.
Now turning to Performance Chemicals, I'd like to provide a brief update on our evaluation of strategic alternatives.
Since our July announcement, we've made significant progress in our efforts to evaluate a wide range of options. Our
primary objective is to identify the alternatives that create the most value for our shareholders. Comprehensive
evaluations have progressed well, and we're carefully reviewing key considerations, including future cash flows,
dividends, debt levels, pensions and taxes, along with a host of other key variables that we know are important to our
shareholders. We are moving with a sense of urgency.
In the interim, we remain focused on delivering results today. Our strategy is clear and it's working. We have created
and are strengthening world leading positions in agriculture and nutrition, bio-based industrials, and advanced

materials. We've made good progress through the first three quarters despite challenging conditions, and are executing
successfully against our strategy.
So with that, Carl, back to you.
Carl J. Lukach
Thanks, Ellen. Okay, let's open up the line now for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Ellen, I asked this last quarter and maybe it was a
little premature. But do you have any sense of the seed cost tailwind that you'll have in corn next year now, maybe that
some of the harvest has come in and you might have a better sense of what your cost build's going to be for next year in
corn?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So seed cost for next year, we're still gathering all the data and in like that. Maybe
we're getting little better yields than we had thought – than we had last year. So we're looking, I don't know, maybe 1%
type of thing, with commodity prices down.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, any sense of how the pricing environment in South
America is going on both the corn and soy side? Are you seeing any unusual behavior from any of your competitors, or
just in the market in general?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: We're not really seeing any unusual competitive behavior. We're seeing that the
economics are causing growers to really think about what they're doing. The shift from corn to soybeans in the summer
and looking at the prices on where corn is down there, what they're going to do for the safrinha planting. So we see a
little bit of a slow start to that, but I don't see anything from a competitive standpoint.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you, can you hear me?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, John. How are you?
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Good, thank you, yourself?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Good.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: I'm interested in the European volume number, because I believe TiO2 is smaller for you in
Europe. And Electronics is smaller and Ag is seasonally smaller in the third quarter. So that's probably maybe the best
industrial read that you've got, in terms of your volume statistics you gave. And Europe was up 10%, I think, year over
year, and it was only up 5% last quarter. So could you comment on that acceleration?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, sure, so I'll separate it first. So if we were up 10% – 16% we were up in volume
in developing Europe, Middle East, and Africa. Developed Europe was up 7%. In developed Europe, we benefited from
improvements in TiO2, in Performance Materials, in Industrial Biosciences, and Ag. So we had those four businesses –

those four areas saw improvement in developed Europe.
Same thing on developing Europe, more emphasis I think on Ag and TiO2. So this is something we're watching very
closely. We see it progressing. I know it has been bumping along the bottom for so long. But I think it's a real testament
to our new products and product progression that we've made in Agriculture and the investments we've made in
developing Europe, and I think we're seeing the results of that investment.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: And then just a follow-up for Nick. Nick, the tax rate for the year-to-date number is 23%.
Your guidance is 22% for the full year. Why didn't you true up to 22% in the year-to-date numbers?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: We did, John, true up to 22%. That's what you saw in the $0.04 number there, the
benefit. And what we'll now see is the fourth quarter impact of that same 22% versus last year's tax rate. This is very
dependent on, as you know, John, geographic mix and how the quarter actually plays out. But year to date last year was
23%, and actually last year was 24% and year to date this year is 23.1%.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Neal P. Sangani>: Good morning, this is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. A question on the U.S. seed and the
growth of the direct-to-farmer approach. Is that something that's going to lead to lower cost?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: We've had direct-to-farmer forever, and we've invested in it over the last few years. I
think that's been that, and the product progression has really enabled us to gain the share that we've gained in North
America in both corn and soy. We believe in that Right Product, Right Acre strategy, making sure that we are working
directly with the farmer; what hybrid, what seed size, get them their first choice, get it in the barn. And I think that's
made us successful in that marketplace. It makes us a little stickier with the farmer and really creates efficiencies in our
supply chain. So it allows us to plan a lot better, since we have that detailed knowledge and the mapping on those acres.
<Q - Neal P. Sangani>: Okay, and Syngenta talked about producing too much seed this year, requiring some
write-downs. Is that an industry issue, or are you all seeing something similar?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Write-downs are a normal part of the seed business. They happen every year. We've
seen our seed yields this year a little better than last year, but not hugely better, and we expect write-downs in the
normal historic range. We don't see anything unusual there.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Hi, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi. I was wondering, Ellen, if you could review the reasons for why you're exploring
strategic options for titanium dioxide for Performance Chemicals, why it might create value to separate the business
off, and if you could also review the arguments against it; that is, why you might keep it or leave the current structure
unchanged?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well certainly, if you think about the focus that we've had since the beginning of 2009
when this leadership team came in, the global financial crisis, and I've talked about this often, is every boat in its own
bottom. The businesses, it's why we changed the segment reporting to get great clarity on how our Ag business is
doing, how our Paint business is doing, how our Chemicals business is doing. We established distinct goals from
growth and margin expansion for each one of those and are on that track. We then as we came out of the financial crisis

really took look at how science makes a difference in creating a differentiated position in the marketplace. And clearly,
as you saw with the disposition of our Paint business, we really felt that there was limited opportunity for science to
make a difference there, and we took the actions that we did.
If you look at Performance Chemicals, it's a strong set of businesses, good margins. We've seen in the last year the
volatility of that set of businesses, $0.65 a share down this year to date I think is the number. Nick can correct me if I've
got it a little wrong.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: That's right.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: And it's been a headwind this year. So you've got a commodities set of businesses.
You've got volatility and low growth. So it's about a GDP growth business. So the question, what role does that have in
our portfolio, and that's what the board and management is discussing. And so from the positive side, it creates cash.
On the negative side, it creates great volatility. And so at the end of the day, I think that we have to understand what is
best for our shareholders. How do we create the most value there?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
<Q - Donald D. Carson>: Thank you; Ellen, a question on Ag. On the top line, you've had strong growth this year, I
think up 12% on a year-to-date basis. If you could just give us a sense of what's price, what's volume, what's the
currency hit you've taken; and more importantly, what's the sustainability of these gains into next year? What are your
expectations, for example, on Pioneer pricing in the U.S. market?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Thanks, Don. We're making great progress in Agriculture this year. Currency has been
about a 2% – two point headwind of that 12%. And so volume and price, it gets a little more price than volume, given
the new products. And that product mix has really been driving our price gains. And so price is a little bit heavier than
volume, but we've had strong volume progression. We grew volume in North America in corn. We will have all those;
we're pulling together all those numbers. If the USDA had only reported in October, we'd in a little better position than
in talking about the totals. But I think that we're really making – we have confidence in the business and we're really
making progress. Now we're heavy into Brazil and last year we gained three points of share both in summer and
safrinha season in corn. We've made a lot of investments in there, in the plants and supply chain improvements down
there. And I think we're going to see great progression there as well.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes, Ellen, just to follow up on your strategic review of Performance Chemicals, I think
you mentioned in your prepared remark you're moving with a sense of urgency. Would you care to offer any update on
timing of a decision and whether or not you've narrowed down the options in terms of whether the businesses might be
separated together with each other or apart from each other and the form of possible separation if you decide to go
down that path?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, so we're looking at a lot of different options. We are operating with a sense of
urgency, and we want to get this done as quickly as we can.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Okay, a follow-up, if I may, on Ag. You mentioned on slide eight that you anticipate an
early start to North America seed shipments. It surprised me a little bit. I guess growers seemed to have been getting
orders in quite early the last two years. Do you expect it to run even earlier this year? And if so, how much might be
pulled from 1Q in your estimation?

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I think that's a little hard to estimate right now. We do see an interest in making sure
that farmers get the right hybrid, the right seed size, get their first choice, and get it in that their barn. And so we're
seeing a little bit more activity there this year than maybe we saw last year. And again, I think that with the moderating
commodity prices, people are very interested in understanding that they're going to get the yield that they need to make
the economics work for them.
We're also seeing a lot of interest in AQUAMax. We've really increased the acres there this year. We'll be excited to
see, I guess in three weeks, Paul Schickler will be out talking about how the season has shaped up for us. But I was out
in Iowa last week, and I was very, very excited to see the performance that our growers are seeing in the field. So I
think there will be good news in a few weeks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you, Ellen, very good results in Performance Materials. First from the top line, you
mentioned China. What's driving that very strong growth in China volumes for Performance Materials?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, so volumes are up 18% in China. And where we're seeing that is in automotive.
Automotive is very strong. The whole world in automotive is only growing 2% this year. China will be up 10%, and
we're making great progress with our penetration on application development and lightweighting vehicles and
advanced plastics. And even in S&P, we're seeing some uplift on Kevlar actually into automotive applications. And so
really China is a story of auto, electronics, and the industrials, and we're seeing progression there versus what this time
last year was a very weak quarter.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And also on Performance [Materials], very good margins as well of 22.5%. Where do you
think margins can go, or should they be sustained here at these levels in Performance Materials going forward?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: In Performance Materials, we're seeing a lot of strength based off our packaging
materials and the penetrations that we've made. We have long-term estimates that are lower than the 23% right now if
you look at it across the entire array, a high teens thing. But this is something that we're challenging the team to do.
We're challenging the team to really understand the new products and the penetration there and what can be achieved
and how differentiated we are in this market. So I'm very excited about what the team is doing in Performance
Materials.

Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, thank you and good morning. I think in your press release, you mentioned about your TiO2
order contracts. What's the timing of the [ph] renewals (41:00) of these orders, and do you have any significant
contracts expiring in 2013?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: So, P.J., when you look at our supply position around ore there, we have staggered
contracts, so not everything expires at one time. But as those contracts have expired as of recent and we've gone out
into the marketplace, we have seen a higher cost in our ore cost as of recent. But we're still very advantaged from an
ore perspective versus the competitive set given our ability to consume the low-grade ores and produce the high-quality
TiO2. So we'll continue to have that occur over time. So there will be contracts ending as we renew others. But in a
macro sense, we remain very advantaged there.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you. And my second question is a follow-up on seed pricing. What kind of seed pricing did
you actually achieve in Latin American this year, and what's the expectation for the U.S. season? Thank you.

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So from a standpoint of seed pricing in Latin America, ours is being driven by
Intrasect. It's really a mix. So as we get more and more penetration and drive the Intrasect product into corn in Latin
America, you're seeing a positive impact on price. And we're saying at this point it's all about yields and what the
farmer can get. Intrasect I think this year is going to be probably a third of our volume and continue to make progress.
In the U.S., it's a little hard to say right now. I think mix is again going to be a driver, and it's going to from a product
standpoint and where farmers think they can get the best yield.
Operator
Thank you, our next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Ritzenthaler>: Good morning. I just had a couple questions on Ag. Insect pressure has been high the
last few seasons in Latin America. Can you elaborate a bit more on what's driving the interest in the Latin American
crop chemistry piece? Overall acreage growth doesn't seem like it's quite enough to substantiate the outlook of the new
products, or is there something more specific?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, so I think what you're seeing is the benefits that Rynaxypyr is creating around
that really heavy insect pressure down in Latin America. It's phenomenally effective. It's very efficient and it's very low
toxic and very human friendly. Our team there, we always question them very deeply about their revenue progression
because now we're saying that globally Rynaxypyr is going to be above $900 million in revenue in 2013, and it didn't
even exist five years ago. I think that's one of the really strong proof points around the power of combining chemistry
and biology, really understanding the biology of the bug and how chemistry can create that real advantage. Farmers are
anticipating heavy pest pressure in Latin American this year and they're taking action on it, and we're seeing that in the
volume numbers in our Agriculture segment.
<Q - Michael Ritzenthaler>: And then as a follow-up, Ellen, what do you see as the best way to value the Ag
business, or what's the best way to incorporate the value of the Ag business more appropriately in DuPont's stock price?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I think what you've seen in the last few years is tremendous performance in our Ag
business against our competition. We're winning in the marketplace; since 2008 ten points a share gain in beans in
North America, six points in corn. Margin expansion, I think you've seen if you look at our stock price over that time, I
think you'll see our total TSR is 180% – 182% versus the S&P of I don't know what, 107%. So I think we've seen since
we've created a very strong position in Ag coming off of 2008 to now, I think you've seen, we've seen our competing in
the marketplace, our winning in the marketplace. And I think you've seen that reflected in the TSR that our
shareholders have experienced since then.

Thank you. Our next question comes from John McNulty from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Good morning. With regard to the strategic review in Performance Chem, I guess it looks
like you and the board have really been trying to figure out. Does it really fit in and does it benefit the company? In this
process, have you and/or the board thought about other assets within the portfolio to see if they also make sense in the
overall platform for DuPont?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, so we, John, as you know, we've instituted in the last 4.5 years a very strong
portfolio analysis process with our board, with management and with the board. We look at it every quarter from a
management standpoint. We take the board through it on a consistent basis, understanding how value is derived from
each one of our major product areas. You see some minor adjustments like in Crop Protection with the sale of
Mancozeb or something like that. You'll see major, like the disposition of our Performance Coatings, and it's a very
active process. We consider the competitive environment. We consider how science can really make a difference from
a competitive standpoint and win in a marketplace because that to us is key. And I think we take that very actively, as

you see from the discussion of what we announced in July that we're looking at strategic alternatives for the
Performance Chemicals areas. And we'll conclude that.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Great. And just as a follow-up, when you look at the major geographic regions, it sounds like
Europe is maybe doing a little bit better. China I think in the opening remarks, it was indicated that that's starting to
maybe reaccelerate. And yet you pulled down your global industrial production forecast. So I guess, where are you
seeing the incremental weakness relative to some of those areas that you highlighted?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, I think while the economists – they were projecting pretty aggressive industrial
production for 2013, and it's turned out to be lower than that. So I guess in the beginning of the year, Nick, I don't know
if you can remember, it was in the high 2s%.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yes, almost 3%.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Almost 3%. Now it's almost...
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Now it's just below 2%.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Just below 2%. So I think that's a reflection of the global economy. We're seeing
bright spots. When you think about automotive, it's only up 2%, but it's up 10% in China. It's going to be up 5%, 6% in
North America. So we're seeing, even though there's lower growth in automotive, we're seeing some real bright spots in
a couple of the regions.
I think we're seeing PV recovery coming. We've seen it a little bit this quarter. We've seen the TiO2 markets stabilize,
really, and Conoco is going sideways a little bit right now. So I think when you put that all up, industrial production's a
little less than what we thought at the beginning of the year. But obviously, with our new products that we've
introduced and our focus on the marketplace, we're going to figure out, regardless of the environment, focus on how we
can win.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning, two questions. First, on the Nutrition & Health business, can you
elaborate a little bit more on what's driving the weak volume performance and when you think you'll be back to a more
sustainable growth trajectory? And then on Agriculture, could you give an update on the 360 [Field360] program? And
I think more broadly, are you seeing any evidence that data intensity is actually driving pricing power and wallet share
gains in the Ag sector, or is it just one more way to maintain touch with the customer?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So I think what you have to consider on the Nutrition & Health is that we shut down
some assets last year and one of the product lines that were not productive. And so part of the negative volume is the
fact that we actually don't sell in those low-end commodity areas anymore, so our volume's down. And as we continue
to drive towards the more differentiated areas like cultures and probiotics, we're really making great progress,
especially with the startup of the plant in China. So I think there's a transition that's going on there that you're going to
see as we come through this, and a real focus on taking those assets and making it much higher quality from that
standpoint.
From a Field360, the whole purpose is to drive yield improvement. Today, it's a subscription base. We're working with
the customer with these tools in order to be able to map and to be able to understand how they can get more from using
data, as big data is your friend. We've got, I think, 1.5 million acres under variable rate seeding prescriptions this past
spring. And we continue to see how the data and the tools can even further enhance our historic strength and right
product, right market. And so we see it as a natural progression of our go-to-market strategy because at the end of the
day, it's all about the farmer, and that's what we're good at.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thanks, Ellen. Given the 14% volume growth in Electronics & Communications and the
share gains that came with it, I wonder if you can give us a sense of what products are driving that. If I remember
correctly, your PV installation expectations are lower now than they were at the beginning of the year. So I'm trying to
get a sense of what the overall balance is. You picked up share of what looks like a smaller overall market?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, so the improvement year over year in Electronics in the third quarter is driven off
of PV, which is Kevlar films and Solamet metalized paste. We're also seeing some Kapton improvement, as you see
new smartphones and things like that come out. But just take Solamet paste. Sales were up 42% year over year, and
Kevlar was up I think over 70% year over year. So you're coming off of a real low point in the third quarter of last year.
We've been on a campaign. I think our team's done a great job in that industry, focused on materials matter; that
materials are a huge part of creating not only the efficiency of the cell or the module, but the lifetime of the module.
And so I think we're seeing the share gain based on that. Dave [Miller] always says this is a lumpy market. So with
him, I hold my breath. But I think you see the focus and the progress that's being made there.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay, and just to follow up, I'm trying to understand the cash flow of the Imprelis
payments. If you're right about the overall $1.2 billion, if I remember correctly, the insurance is about $700 million.
Has that already paid out, or does that pay out late? I'm just trying to get a sense of what the cash flow impact might be.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Nick, why don't you take that one?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: So when you look at the cash flow thus far in the way of payments from the insurance
companies, we've had our first insurance payment of $25 million. So that's all we've seen to date. And that's something
that will now progress as time goes forward. You know what the accrual is to date, and you can see what we've put in
the press release as the ceiling.
Operator
Thank you. We now have Chris Nocella online from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris J. Nocella>: Thanks, good morning. Nick, just sticking with cash, both your share count and cash balance
moved higher in the quarter. So can you remind us how much you have left in your share repurchase program and why
you aren't a little more aggressive on this front?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: We continue to be very active in the share buyback arena. We bought over $1 billion
this year. And if you look back over time, over the last – let's say, since fourth quarter 2010 time period, we've bought
back over $2 billion, $2.3 billion worth of shares. So it's not something that we don't exercise and utilize. We have and
we will continue to do so. We have a program, an active program, where we still have $1.7 billion left available to us
for share buyback. We'll continue to execute against that. As I've said before, it's not a one-for-one thing, but we will
continue to utilize that program and continue to make sure we maintain a valid share count there.

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, I think that Cyazypyr is just now being registered around the world, so we're
going to see next year an uptake on Cyazypyr. I also think the seed treatments Dermacor and Lumigen are going to be
tremendous additions to those. And I think the margins are going to hold. I think we're seeing equal value from the
newer chemistry Cyazypyr in the seed treatment area as well. So we see it as really just tremendous progress being
made by that business.

Thank you. We have Mark Gulley online from BGC Financial. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: Good morning. You talked about some headwinds for this year in terms of certain items. How
much of a headwind will a higher tax rate possibly be in 2014 versus the 22% tax rate baseline that you're seeing for
this year?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: We haven't sized that yet, Mark, for next year on the tax rate and expectations on that.
Right now, we're saying, as we've stated, that this year is going to be the 22%. And a lot will depend on the mix and the
forecast we have from the businesses as we go through our reviews around execution and objective setting for next year
within the businesses.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: And secondly, you did provide some volume information with respect to the TiO2 business.
I'm wondering if you can approximate the size of the price movement year to year and what it might look for the fourth
quarter.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Price is a competitive issue in that marketplace. So you can see from the standpoint of
what our earnings have done where price must be. But I think that's an industry issue.

Thank you. Our last question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Just under the wire. I wanted to say I appreciate the segment commentary page, as that was
very helpful.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: You said that last time too. So we reinforced you by sending it out again.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: I'm consistent, keep it coming. Keep it coming. Hey, Nick, you mentioned that the unfunded
balance is going to be down about $2 billion to $3 billion in the fourth quarter. Assuming that the current rate
assumptions hold together, the pension was like $0.46 negative in 2012, $0.40 this year. What should we be thinking
about ballpark for 2014?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Frank, it's too soon to talk about that piece of it because what you're talking about is
the accounting side of it there, and a lot of things still have to play out by year end. I will say my guess is it's going to
be lower again, but I just don't have it sized yet at this point, Frank.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: We'll put that out when we have it.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: As it gets closer to year end, Frank, I'll be able to give a better feel on that.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right, great. And, Ellen, obviously your balance sheet is not stressed. What should we be
thinking about in terms of the M&A pipeline that DuPont has, and can we see some action taking place there in the
near term?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I think, Frank, we've been real consistent on how we've talked about the M&A
pipeline. We're looking for things either from a science or technology standpoint that really can advance the positions
of where we are and/or geographic coverage like you've seen with Pannar. Pannar brought not only geographic
