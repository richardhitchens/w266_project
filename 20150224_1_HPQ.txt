Meg Whitman
Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.
With the first quarter of fiscal 2015 now behind us, I would say that overall we're on track with our turnaround and
executing well on our separation. In Q1, we delivered solid performance in our business operations. We achieved
non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.92, which was at the high end of our outlook range. We continued to
improve profitability, growing operating profit margins across all our major business segments. We increased
investments in innovation to drive the future of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., and we executed well
across key areas of our portfolio, including Industry Standard Servers, converged storage, private and managed cloud,
personal systems and graphics. While we have more work to do to improve performance in other parts of the business,
we're about where we expected to be at this point in our turnaround journey.
Now, there are a couple of factors that had an impact on our first quarter financial results and how we think about the
rest of the year, and I want to address these. Let me talk for a moment about the global environment with a particular
focus on unfavorable currency movements, and I also want to address cash flow.
We're all aware that the global environment and currency movements have been a challenge for U.S.-based companies.
For HP, the challenge is particularly acute, with 65% of our revenue coming from outside the United States, and over
half of that from EMEA. This all impacts HP in multiple ways. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our
reported revenue. Our revenue declined approximately 5% year-over-year as reported, but only 2% in constant
currency. In addition, the recent currency movements have disrupted the competitive pricing landscape and impacted
customer demand. Aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the printing business, given the weakness of
the yen, was a continued challenge.
We were able to manage these impacts in the quarter and deliver earnings as expected but given the specific hedges we
had in place and the significant currency movement that took place in January, we anticipate the impact on the
remainder of FY15 will be greater than what we saw in Q1. We're working hard to offset these impacts through
repricing and productivity, but let me be very clear: fully mitigating currency movements of this size would require
reducing investments in areas like innovation, key systems and tools and placement of printer units. That simply would
not be the right thing to do.

When we discussed the impact of currency on revenue in November, we estimated our headwind for fiscal 2015 to be
approximately two points year-over-year. We now expect that headwind to be approximately six points, assuming
today's rates. That difference equates to approximately $3.3 billion in revenue, $1.5 billion in operating profit or $0.60
in earnings per share. We believe we will be able to manage half of that through repricing and cost actions but estimate
a negative earnings impact of approximately $0.30 per share entirely due to currency. While we have taken down our
full year earnings outlook, we remain on track to deliver flat revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Cathie will
share more details on how we manage currency movements across the portfolio.
Now turning to cash flow. Q1 results were below our expectations, impacted primarily by an increase in our cash
conversion cycle and by timing issues. The cash conversion cycle was higher than expected as a result of higher days
sales outstanding. Also we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than we expected and outperformed on HP
Financial Services volume, which negatively impacts cash year-on-year. However, except for the currency impact and
separation payments, we would have expected cash flow for the full year to be in line with our original outlook of $6.5
billion to $7 billion. Cathie will have more to say about this in a moment.
Now let's talk about business performance and innovation. And as I said at the beginning of the call, we continue to
make progress in our operating performance. In Personal Systems, the team is executing well. We outgrew the market
and gained share across all regions. We saw particular strength in notebooks, where we regained our number one share
position worldwide. Commercial remains a key focus for us, and at Discover in December we announced the industry's
thinnest and lightest business-class notebook, enabling our customers to be more productive in more places.
In Printing, profitability remained strong, but we continue to face top line challenges. Hardware & Supplies revenue
declined and going forward, we are going to be more aggressive in placing units to support long-term Supplies growth.
I'm looking forward to some of the exciting new products Dion and his team are planning to launch in the coming
months.
The Enterprise Group performed well, with 9% growth in constant currency in Industry Standard Servers, led by strong
Gen9 adoption and improved sales execution. HP's end-to-end compute strategy led by the Gen9 portfolio has
redefined the broader server industry, and improvements in sales execution are paying off.
We also saw improved performance in Business Critical Systems and our new products are gaining traction with
customers. During the quarter, we expanded our server portfolio with HP Integrity Superdome X and HP Integrity
NonStop X. These platforms run our customers' most demanding mission critical workloads on x86 architectures, with
higher levels of performance, scalability, availability and efficiency.
In Storage, we returned to growth in constant currency and we anticipate a fourth quarter of external disk market share
expansion based on calendar Q4 results. We continue to see an industry shift to the mid-range, which is our sweet spot,
and at Discover we announced a refreshed portfolio of mid-range and flash optimized HP 3PAR StoreServ systems.
And it's becoming clear around the industry that our HP converged storage portfolio is the best in the market. Just this
month, HP 3PAR won the 2014 Search Storage Product of the Year Gold award.
However, in Networking, results were disappointing after many quarters of growth. We had execution issues in the
U.S. and in China, which we are working to address. We made leadership changes in China in the quarter, which we
believe will strengthen our ability to compete effectively in what remains a tough market. And in the U.S. we are
realigning sales incentives to increase focus.
We continue to bring new networking solutions to market. Just last week we announced a new line of open network
switches providing web scale customers choice, agility and scalability in their data center networks. We're focused on
winning in this business, and you will continue to see us make aggressive moves over the coming quarters.
Technology Services was consistent with recent quarters, with strong and predictable profitability. The team continued
to execute well, improving efficiency across the organization while driving order growth in constant currency. We were
pleased with the continued momentum in newer portfolio offerings like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care.

In cloud, our HP Helion portfolio continues to gain traction worldwide, capturing market share in open hybrid cloud.
During the quarter, we announced HP Helion wins with Alcatel-Lucent, Halford, Telecom Italia, and Symantec, and
we've seen strong-pull through of HP products and services by new customers of HP Helion. Last month, HP Helion
was recognized as a leader by Forrester Research in their inaugural Forrester Wave for private cloud in China, earning
the highest ranking for strategy. And earlier in the quarter, IDC recognized HP as a leader in U.S. government private
cloud.
In Enterprise Services, revenue continued to be impacted by key account runoff, softness in EMEA and currency
headwinds. However, profitability improved year-over-year in line with our expectations, and sales metrics are
reflecting the go-to-market transformation underway in this business. Among recent new logo wins, HP Enterprise
Services was selected by TNT, one of the largest excess delivery companies to help future-proof the business by
consolidating and virtualizing its IT infrastructure and moving some functions to an HP Helion managed virtual private
cloud environment. And just today, we announced a major multi-billion dollar customer win with Deutsche Bank. With
this partnership, HP will help Deutsche Bank meet its long-term business objectives through a transformation of its IT
infrastructure, including a customized HP Helion solution, that will enable them to focus on creating and delivering
new services for their clients. This was a hard fought win for HP, and I'm very pleased with the outcome.
In software, we continue to shift our portfolio and operating model to SaaS and subscription-based offerings. Customer
consumption behavior and the need to adjust sales motions accordingly created a near-term revenue headwind. Total
revenue was down. However, we saw growth in security. And our recent acquisition of Voltage Security strengthens
our portfolio in data encryption. During the quarter, we also unveiled HP HAVEn on-demand, an important milestone
in our big data strategy that gives organizations cloud-based access to key components of our HAVEn analytics
platform.
Overall, we continue to see strength across many of our businesses, while other areas still need more work.
Operationally, we get stronger with each passing month. And, just as important, our innovation engine continues to
hum. And I expect that the pace of innovation will accelerate through the rest of the year.
With that, let me turn it over to Cathie to provide a deeper look at the financial performance and our outlook.
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thanks, Meg.
Overall, we delivered revenue of $26.8 billion, down 5% year-over-year, or down 2% in constant currency. Despite
currency headwinds and even as we continue to increase our R&D investments, we improved profitability
year-over-year. Gross margin was 23.4%, up 0.6 points year-over-year, and quarter-over-quarter gross margin was
down 1.2 points, in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.8%, up 0.3 points year-over-year.
We are nearing the completion of our 2012 restructuring plan. In Q1, about 2800 people exited the company, making
the total reduction to date approximately 44,000. We are on track to complete this existing program, with a total of
55,000 people expected to exit by the end of fiscal 2015. However, we do anticipate incremental opportunities for
operational improvements identified through the separation process.
Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.92 primarily excludes pre-tax charges of $222 million for
amortization of intangible assets, $146 million for restructuring, and $80 million associated with the separation.
Including these charges, GAAP diluted net earnings per share for Q1 was $0.73, in line with our previously provided
outlook of $0.72 to $0.76 per share.
Turning to the business performance. In Personal Systems revenue grew 3% in constant currency or flat as reported.
We outgrew the market and gained share across all regions while increasing profitability year-over-year to 3.7%. We
saw particular strength in Notebooks and continued to roll out exciting products. While commercial revenue was up
only 1% in constant currency following the XP migration, we saw an increase in consumer momentum with 4%
revenue growth in constant currency.

In Printing, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency, or 5% as reported, with some challenges in both
hardware and supplies, and particular weakness in Russia. Profitability remained strong at 19.2%. Declines in low end
home and single function mono laser hardware units drove overall units down 4% year-over-year. While it will take
some time to turn the corner, we continue to make progress in our strategy of improving the quality of our installed
base. Our unit mix improved with solid growth in key high-usage products like Officejet Pro X and value
multi-function printers.
Graphics Performance remains strong with our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The increasing scale
has contributed to a year-over-year increase in operating profit. Also, in Managed Print Services, we saw a double-digit
total contract value growth year-over-year. Although we still saw declines in overall supplies revenue, we continued to
improve the revenue trajectory in ink, while managing ink and toner channel inventory within desired ranges. Overall
supplies revenue mix was 65% of total print revenue.
The Enterprise Group performed well, with revenue up 3% in constant currency, or flat as reported with strong
profitability of 15.6%. ISS revenue grew 9% in constant currency, or 7% as reported with growth across all regions and
strength in core rack and blades categories. We also saw some recovery in Business Critical Systems with revenue
down only 7% in constant currency, or 9% as reported.
In Storage, performance improved in Q1 with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency, or flat as reported.
Converged storage was up 21%, now making up 50% of total storage revenue. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 12%
year-over-year. All flash 3PAR revenue accelerated, now making up 20% of total 3PAR mid-range portfolio. Also, we
expect to be the only scaled vendor to gain external disk share year-over-year for the last four quarters.
In Networking revenue was down 9% year-over-year in constant currency, or down 11% as reported. However, we
continue to see positive momentum in our date center switching business, which grew for the fifth consecutive quarter.
And while we had execution issues in the U.S. and China, we delivered solid revenue growth in the rest of the world.
Technology Services revenue was down 2% year-over-year in constant currency, or down 5% as reported. Orders grew
in constant currency, driven by support in EMEA and strong renewals. Enterprise Services revenue was down 8%
year-over-year in constant currency, or down 11% as reported. Application and Business Services and IT Outsourcing
were each down 11% as key account runoff and weakness in EMEA offset the momentum we're seeing in Strategic
Enterprise Services, or Services for the new style of IT.
Profitability improved year-over-year to 3%, up 1.9 points driven primarily by productivity actions and improved
margins in underperforming accounts. Also, the sales team increased efficiency with improved win rates and reduced
field selling costs. Total contract value was up, with double digit growth in renewals, in new logos, and in SES signings
with particular strength in key areas, including cloud and big data. Software revenue was down 3% year-over-year in
constant currency, or down 5% as reported as we faced execution challenges and headwinds from our shift to SaaS.
Profitability was 18%, up 2.2 points year-over-year, as we effectively managed costs while increasing R&D investment
in strategic areas such as big data and security.
Finally, in HP Financial Services, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency, or down 8% as reported
due to an early contract termination in the prior year period, making for a tough compare for revenue and operating
profit. However, we experienced double digit new volume growth and record high attach rate to HP's products and
services. ROE was just over 17%, and HP Financial Services continues to be a key differentiator for HP.
Before we get to the outlook, I want to spend a bit more time helping you understand how currency impacts our
business. With two thirds of our revenue coming from outside of the U.S., the impact from currency movements is
significant. As Meg said, we have taken down our full year non-GAAP earnings outlook, and this is entirely due to the
currency challenges she described. We continue to offset currency movements as much as possible through hedging
strategies. We have rolling hedging programs which are designed to minimize the volatility of results by dampening
large fluctuations. However, significant and sustained currency moves cannot be managed by hedges alone. We also
use repricing as a lever when possible, considering competitive market dynamics. The hedging programs vary by
business depending upon these factors.

As an example, Personal Systems and our EG hardware businesses have very little in natural hedges as our component
contracts are typically in U.S. dollars. As a result, these businesses are disproportionately impacted by currency
movements. However, we do have some ability to increase pricing in response to currency movements, while being
mindful of competition and potential negative impacts to customer demand.
In Printing, we have a lot of moving parts with currency impacting our business both directly and indirectly. Like the
other segments, the Printing business is negatively impacted by the strength of the dollar on the top and bottom line.
The weaker yen helps the cost side of our business, but it also allows our Japanese competitors to price much more
aggressively. In addition, Printing, specifically the laser business, is overweight in Russia, which adds yet another
dimension to currency impacts.
Services have more natural hedges, since revenue and expenses are more closely matched in the same currency. But
due to the nature of our contracts, repricing in response to currency movements is less of a lever. Across all of our
businesses, we will continue to manage the currency challenge while also making the right tradeoffs to support our
strategy for long-term success.
We discussed the currency impacts to the P&L, but now let me talk about the balance sheet. As we discussed last
quarter, we hedge our balance sheet based on anticipated net monetary assets and liabilities. Any hedge gains or losses
are reported within the other assets and liabilities section and not the specific cash flow line item.
Across the specific line items in Q1, we saw the largest impact from currency on working capital and financing
receivables. The change to our cash conversion cycle would suggest a working capital headwind year-over-year of
approximately $750 million. But the actual headwind is approximately $1.1 billion when including the hedge gain that
is reported in other assets and liabilities. Similarly, the cash headwind from reported financing receivables appears in
the statements of cash flow to be approximately $100 million, but is actually closer to $250 million when including this
adjustment. The offset means that the headwind of approximately $1.3 billion in other assets and liabilities is actually a
lower headwind of about $800 million. Making this distinction is important so we can focus on the true drivers of cash
flow.
Next, I want to discuss cash flow and capital allocation. In Q1, cash flow from operations was $744 million, and free
cash flow was -$73 million. We had several factors impacting our operating and free cash flow in Q1. Remember, Q1
is typically the lowest cash flow quarter for HP. And we did expect this to be true again in fiscal 2015. Having said
that, the cash flow results were down year-over-year and somewhat below our expectations, and I want to take a minute
to explain.
First, we had a working capital impact; the cash conversion cycle increased sequentially in Q1 2015 but declined
sequentially in Q1 2014, which created a headwind of about $1.1 billion net of hedging. While we anticipated a lot of
this, days sales outstanding was higher than expected, largely due to non-recurring operational issues in the quarter,
intra-month linearity in January and other smaller factors. Some of these smaller factors may continue and are captured
in our outlook.
We still expect the cash conversion cycle to be 10 to 12 days by year-end, as we continue to make the right tradeoffs
between the use of cash and P&L optimization. As an example, we may decide to ship finished goods by boat versus by
plane, which increases inventory but reduces cost of sales. Similarly, taking advantage of early pay discounts from
suppliers reduces costs but decreases accounts payable. We do a full cost benefit analysis to make sure these decisions
drive economic value.
Next, we had a tough compare. Q1 2014 included proceeds from a large real estate sale, which drove an increase in net
CapEx year-over-year in Q1 2015. Finally, there were several other unfavorable movements in Q1 2015. We had
double-digit capital lease volume growth, which obviously is great for our business, but this was a greater use of cash
this year than last. We also ended the quarter with higher receivables from vendor rebates and contract manufacturers
as well as lower litigation reserves, and we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than expected.

I want to reemphasize that while Q1 cash flow was down year-over-year, we remain confident in our ability to generate
cash as we've demonstrated over many quarters. We are providing an updated outlook today to our free cash flow, but
the reduction from our $6.5 billion to $7 billion outlook last quarter is only due to currency and separation impacts
we've announced today.
Turning to capital allocation, in Q1 we repurchased 41.1 million shares and paid $304 million in dividends for a total
capital return to shareholders of $1.9 billion. This makes up for the $750 million shortfall from our fiscal 2014
commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Turning to the separation. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we will incur incremental separation costs and
foreign tax expenses in both fiscal 2015 and 2016 associated with separating into two companies. The scale of this
separation is unprecedented in its size and complexity.
Over the past few months, we defined and quantified the expected charges related to the separation. These charges
include finance, IT, consulting and legal fees, real estate and other items that are incremental and one time in nature
and not reflective of our operational performance. In addition, we've estimated our incremental foreign tax expenses
related to the separation of foreign legal entities. The charges and taxes associated with the separation are excluded
from our non-GAAP earnings.
The Q1 GAAP charge associated with the separation was $80 million, and we expect the Q2 GAAP charge to be
approximately $250 million. Full year fiscal 2015 charges are expected to be $1.3 billion and the FY16 estimate is
$500 million. While these are large numbers, they represent less than 2% of our annual operating costs and are
necessary to realize the potential of the separation into two world-class companies.
Separation-related capital spend this year is expected to be approximately $300 million. The incremental growth
foreign tax expenses are estimated to be about $950 million in fiscal 2015. We do expect more than half of the tax
expenses to be offset by foreign tax credits. In fiscal 2015, we anticipate a credit of about $200 million and the rest over
the next few years. We will continue to provide updates on our separation on our quarterly calls.
Turning to the outlook for Q2 and the remainder of fiscal 2015, from a macro perspective we've already talked about
the impact associated with currency shifts. Additionally, we see continued challenges across certain geographies
including China, where we anticipate increasing competitiveness from local vendors and Russia, where political and
economic concerns are ongoing. These challenges are being offset to some degree by strengthening of the U.S.
economy.
By business, in Personal Systems, while the PC market is expected to continue to contract, we plan to leverage our
brand, channel, scale and strong product lineup to continue to gain share profitably. We will take advantage of the
momentum in consumer and continue our strategic focus on commercial, including commercial mobility.
In Printing, we're planning to be more aggressive in placing hardware units with continued focus on high value units.
We will manage supplies channel inventory closely while driving further stability in supplies revenue in fiscal 2015. In
Enterprise Group we expect server momentum to continue with the Gen9 lineup and server refresh cycle. We expect
storage, particularly 3PAR, to outperform key competitors, especially in the mid-range.
In Networking we expect continued challenges in the near term, but are making adjustments to improve execution. In
Enterprise Services we expect continued improvement in profitability, making progress towards our long-term goal of
7% to 9% operating profit, and remain confident in our full year operating margin outlook of 4% to 6%.
Given the current revenue trajectory and the expectation that currency will continue to be a headwind, we are providing
a new Enterprise Services full year revenue outlook. Because of the currency volatility, going forward we will provide
this on a constant currency basis. We now expect full year revenue to decline 4% to 6%. We expect year-over-year
revenue performance improvement in the second half of fiscal 2015.
In software, we plan to continue to shift our go-to-market focus and further align our product portfolio to best capture
the growing SaaS opportunity. We also have much more work to do to drive consistent sales execution across the
organization.

Overall, for fiscal 2015, we remain optimistic about the market opportunity and our competitive positioning. However,
the currency headwind at current rates cannot be fully absorbed. We've done detailed modeling using current exchange
rates and assumptions for repricing and productivity. With all of that in mind, we are updating fiscal 2015 non-GAAP
diluted net earnings per share outlook to be $3.53 to $3.73, which is lower by $0.30 due to currency headwinds.
Fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $2.03 to $2.23. Q2 fiscal 2015 non-GAAP
diluted net earnings per share outlook is expected to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88, which includes $0.09 of currency
pressure. Q2 fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.57 to $0.61. Given the
updated earnings outlook for currency, and the introduction of cash related separation activities we're updating our
fiscal 2015 free cash flow outlook to be approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Hi, thanks. Meg, you're now a couple of months into the separation, and I assume that
you've gotten more detail on where you can find some additional savings. I was hoping you could talk through some of
the additional savings you expect and also how you feel about the separation at this point three months in? Thanks.
<A - Meg Whitman>: Yeah, great, Sherri. So we are making real progress on the separation. Recall that we are
separating into two Fortune 50 companies. I mean, it's sort of hard to imagine that there are two Fortune 50 companies
embedded in HP. And that has included an entire organizational design and selection process, the IT strategy, carve out
financials, and many other activities. And I think actually that we are executing on all cylinders.
There has not been distraction to the core business. We've got a dedicated team focusing on the separation. And the rest
of the company is focused on delivering for customers. And I feel very good about that and also the feedback from
partners and customers has been terrific. So lots and lots of work ahead but I feel good about where we are.
It has surfaced lots of opportunities for continued cost savings and the ability to operate more efficiently. And when
you tear apart a company that's been built up over many years through acquisition, through different systems being
merged together, it's remarkable what you find. And whether it is single owners for end to end cost structure, the ability
to benchmark versus our competitors on how many spans and layers we have, the ability to make small changes in the
portfolio that we want to go forward with, lots and lots of opportunities. That's going to make us much stronger as we
go forward as two independent companies.
So we're pretty excited about it. It is a huge amount of work. But I have to say, it's exhilarating because we see the
future where these two companies will be far more cost competitive than even we are today as HPQ.
<A - Jim Bergkamp>: Thanks, Sherri. Next question please.

The next question will come from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. Can you just talk a little bit about the Deutsche Bank deal? My impression of the
scope of the deal was much deeper than maybe some would think you have the capability to provide. Maybe if you can
just give us more specifics around that, in detail around the deal. What was the primary driver to the win? Were there
particular products or solutions that were central to it? And then maybe just related to that, more generally talk about
where you are in Services bookings and where you expect that to be? Thanks.

<A - Meg Whitman>: So we're very proud of the Deutsche Bank win. And it was a full on One HP effort including
our Enterprise Group, our Software business, our Cloud business as well as our Services business. And it was a
Services-led win. And I believe the reason that we won is we had the best technical solution for what Deutsche Bank
needed, which was to reduce cost, reduce costs significantly by the way, increase agility, and migrate to a new world
order of CICD DevOps and in a cloud based environment.
So I think we showed up with the best team, with the best technical solution and a competitive price. As you know, this
is a long sales cycle business. I think we first engaged with Deutsche Bank over 18 months ago, maybe even closer to
two years. So these are long-standing deals, but we're very excited because everyone in the industry wanted this
business. It was a hallmark or a lighthouse account. And we did it on our terms, so we feel pretty good about it.
I would say Helion was a big part of the differentiated solution. I think our ability to provide global support on an
unprecedented scale was an important part of the win, and our ability to advise and transform. The key risk in these
deal is: how do you get from where are you to where you need to be? And I think we were judged to the safest pair of
hands.
<A - Jim Bergkamp>: Thanks Maynard. Next question.
Operator
The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I was wondering – I was wondering if you could comment on your
revenue expectation for this year. You were down about 2.5% in constant currency this quarter. I think the goal was to
be about flat at constant currency for this year. Do you still believe you can achieve that? And I guess, given some of
the commentary around geographies, et cetera, it would seem not, and so perhaps I go back to you, Meg, and say you're
on track, but it actually feels like you're a little bit behind track in terms of where you thought revenues may have been
for this year.
<A - Meg Whitman>: So, we still believe we can be flat in constant currency in FY 2015, and as you can imagine
we've put a lot of thought into this, because the macroeconomic environment, particularly in places like Russia, where
we are overexposed, and China is pretty challenging. But listen, we did well in PSG, very well in Industry Standard
Servers, and this is perhaps the biggest turnaround over the last couple of years. This was a very troubled business two
years ago, and the team has done a remarkable job. Graphics and print is doing incredibly well. And ES, and this will
be the key to a flat constant currency, is we expect better revenue performance in the second half from ES. Profitability
was good in Q1, but we expect to have a much slower rate of decline by the end of the year. And Deutsche, TNT, other
wins are important to that.
So I'm optimistic that we will be flat in constant currency. Listen, if there's another major geopolitical disruption, that
could be off the table, but as we sit here today we think flat in constant currency.
Cathie, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I don't think I can add anything to that. I agree. I think that we will ultimately be roughly
flat in constant currency, and the key is going to be Enterprise Services. And we announced Deutsche Bank, we've
already won in Q2 a couple of big deals, the other one's not public yet but that is going to give us some help in the
second half, as is the fact that the key account runoff that we've been talking about really abates in the second half of
the year, as we're getting largely through it. And so that also helps from a year-on-year compare perspective.
<A - Meg Whitman>: I think you think about it, Toni, as the bathtub and the water is now going to stop draining out
of the bathtub as fast as it has, so the water that we pour in ought to lead to a rising level in the tub. And I would say
new logos, SES very strong, but we've got to continue to execute.
<A - Jim Bergkamp>: Thanks, Toni.

The next question will come from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Yes, thank you. Cathie, in your cash flow discussion, you mentioned inter-month linearity in
January as a factor impacting DSOs and therefore for cash flow, and I wonder if you can expand on that, in part
because other enterprise hardware companies have said in the month of January they started to see delays in spending
as global customers have to deal with the currency impact on their own business and therefore are delaying spending
and revisiting their budget, and I just wonder whether you and Meg think that could be a risk that plays out this year?
Thank you.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So Katy, that's really not what we're hearing in terms of – when we think about the
quarter. It wasn't so much that we were seeing kind of enterprise customers delaying as a result of the currency. That's
really not what we're hearing.
We did see some softness in January overall in the PC business, and so it was the quarter was a bit more front-end
loaded than what would be kind of our historical norm. But when you look at overall HP in January and then you look
at what we had expected – and I think this is really important because when I was talking about the cash flow
implication, it was really relative to our expectations and what around cash flow. We had expected a January that was
better balanced first half to second half, and what we saw was actually a bit more that got shifted from the first half to
the second half, and that impacted, obviously, DSO.
<A - Meg Whitman>: And I'll just chime into that, Katy. We have a great channel from our sales force to us, and I'm
out in the field all the time with customers. I'm not actually hearing that. That doesn't mean that won't turn up, but we're
not hearing that people are delaying purchases because budgets are tightening and things like that.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thank you very much.

The next question will come from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Hi guys, thanks. I just wanted to drill into the networking commentary a little bit. You guys had
said that you were a little bit disappointed in the performance in the quarter. You made some interesting
announcements last week with regards to "brite box" switches, but you seem to be doing a lot of things in networking. I
just wonder if, Meg, you could maybe talk a little bit about the strategy there. Do you guys intend to consolidate the
strategy around brite box? Do you intend to have a broad spectrum of product offerings? Just help us understand how
the strategy might be evolving there.
<A - Meg Whitman>: Sure. Networking is a very important business to HP. You will recall from a financial
architecture perspective, Networking and Storage are margin accretive. So these are important businesses to us and we
will continue to invest in these businesses. You're right, we had two execution challenges, one in China and one in the
U.S., and I think we touched on those.
The strategy here is exactly the same strategy, in many ways, that we've deployed with servers, which is a market
segmentation strategy. What kind of customers want to buy what kind of gear, and then we need to have that for them.
So, for example, in servers we have high-performance compute, and we have terrific data center switches and wired
and wireless LAN products. But we also have benefited by having a hyperscale offering through our joint venture with
Foxconn in the server business, which led to the thesis that we should have a white box strategy for our networking
business, because there's a lot of people for whom that is the solution that they prefer. And better for us to offer it and
surround with other HP products and services than walk away from that market segment entirely. We're very clear that
we only play in businesses in which we can grow profitably.

We have no interest in losing money in any business, and we believe in this new opportunity that we announced that we
will make money there. So it is a market segmentation-based strategy where we have to have the right product with the
right services attached that allows us to make money and gain share. So, a rougher than anticipated quarter in
Networking. It doesn't deter us. We just know we've got to make a couple of changes to execute better.

The next question will come from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. Meg, I wonder if you could talk about your playing to win framework.
That's not something you've spoken about much, and from what I've heard about it, it sounds like it's fairly important
and particularly to the discipline and execution of HP. Is that true?
<A - Meg Whitman>: It is true, actually. The entire company has organized around "Playing to Win", which is a book
written by A.G. Lafley and a colleague of his. And listen, there's many ways to deploy strategy in companies – this is
one that I have found to be particularly helpful, because organizations have a lot of trouble making choices, particularly
at our scale. So this notion of where to play, what countries, what market segments, what products, and where not to
play because we can't do it profitably has been a very good discipline – and actually Dion Weisler has led the way in
Printing and Personal Systems. And then once you determine where you're going to play, how to win and that is
through a combination of where you're going to excel versus competitors. And it's actually been a really good common
framework that we can apply across HP, it's easily understandable, and actually forces the tough tradeoffs.
So listen, as I said, there's lots of ways to deploy strategy, but this has been particularly, I think, effective at HP because
everyone speaks the same language now.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thanks.
<A - Jim Bergkamp>: Thanks, Steve.

The next question will come from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Suva>: Great, thanks very much. Cathie, can you just help us bridge the difference of the current free cash
flow guidance of $3.5 billion to $4 billion versus the prior of $6.5 billion to $7 billion? Just help us quantify or
understand the bridge of where the $3 billion go to, because a lot of these timing things over a long-term, whether it's
inventory, cables, whatever, should kind of wash out. So if you can help us understand on a yearly basis where the $3
billion went.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. And Jim, you're absolutely right. The softness that we saw in free cash flow in Q1
was largely the result of timing, and so we don't believe has an impact to the total year. So if we go – if we start with
the $6.5 billion to $7 billion that was the outlook back in November, you then take into consideration the separation
costs for fiscal 2015, which are $1.3 billion. You've got incremental foreign taxes, net of credits in the year that are
about $750 million of cash outflow. And then you've got the separation CapEx, which is about $300 million. And
finally you've got $0.30 a share for currency. And that takes you to the $3.5 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow for
fiscal 2015.
<Q - James Suva>: Gotcha. So the original separation costs of $1.3 billion was not in the $6.5 billion to $7 billion?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: That's right. And if you actually go back to this, we were pretty clear on the fact that we
had not quantified to the point where we were comfortable giving explicit guidance about what the separation costs
were going to be three months ago. We actually have spent a tremendous amount of time kind of identifying and

<Q - James Suva>: Sure prefect. Thank you for the...
<A - Meg Whitman>: Oh, sorry, Jim; go ahead.
<Q - James Suva>: I was going to say that's perfect clarification. So it's really the add-on of separation costs and
currency?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: That's right. That's the only change that we've got to our outlook for free cash flow for the
year. The base to start with is the $6.5 billion to $7 billion that we provided last quarter.

The next question will come from Ben Reitzes of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Hey. Good afternoon, thanks. I wanted to ask about your pricing commentary. The 19.2%
margin in Printing doesn't seem indicative of a nasty pricing environment. It actually seems like the opposite. I know
you've got the yen flowing through there, but I wanted to understand the pricing comment better. Does that mean that
Printing margins are really going to fall a lot due to pricing in upcoming quarters? And what does it really mean when
you're balancing the fact that margins are at these historical highs and you're saying there's pricing pressure? Thanks a
lot.
<A - Meg Whitman>: Yeah, so we do think that the 19.2% profitability, and really the profitability over the last
quarter or two, has been unsustainably high. And remember the business model is: we price printers at a loss in
exchange for a long-term annuity. But I've actually asked Dion Weisler to join us on the call today. And so Dion you
might comment a little bit about that.
<A - Dion Weisler>: Yeah, I think you're quite right, Meg. We don't believe that 19% OP is good for the business
long-term, and therefore it is not sustainable. And over the last several quarters, we've made real operational
improvements. We've also had some cost benefit from the weakness of the yen, which is, of course, a double-edged
sword. On the one hand it helps us lower cost, yet on the other, our fierce Japanese competitors have leveraged the yen
to be more aggressive on unit placement, which we need to respond to.
So in order for us to maintain competitiveness, we need to invest some of these savings. And we'll do that, really, in
three ways. Firstly, we'll be more aggressive in placing more units, with a keen focus on placing high-value units that
will drive future supplies growth. Secondly, we'll continue to expand our print sales specialist team to continue to drive
growth in our managed print services business. And then finally, we'll invest in new technologies, like page wide array
that fuels everything from the Officejet Pro X, all the way through being the underpinning and underlying technology
behind multi-jet Fusion, which is of course the engine behind our 3D printers.
Of course, we'll continue to strike the right balance between growth and profitability, but we believe 19% operating
profit is not good for the business long-term.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: I appreciate the answer...
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And I'd like to also add – Sorry, Ben. I'd like to also add that when you look at the benefit
that we're get explicitly from the weakness of the yen, in the back half of the year, that on a year-over-year basis is
significantly reduced, even at the current levels of exchange rates there. So we do expect some of that benefit kind of
moves away from us. The other thing, this is the only segment in Q1 where overall, on a direct basis, they had a
positive impact from currency. So again IPG is a little bit different than the other businesses. It's got the same top line
and bottom line pressures from the strength of the dollar. It does have a benefit from the weakness of the yen and then
it does have to deal with Russia. But in Q1, the net currency impact was actually positive. We don't expect that that

continues in the rest of the year as the yen benefit basically moves away from us. And, over time, we also hedge longer
term, especially in the supplies area in IPG and those hedges start to roll off as well.

The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: Yes, thank you. Could you help us think through the dynamics of PC unit sales this year. For
the quarter, obviously, the metrics look pretty strong, but I know you commented about January starting off weak. How
are you expecting this to progress through the course of the year and any geographical color would be helpful. Thank
you.
<A - Meg Whitman>: I'm sorry, I couldn't exactly hear you. The dynamics of the...?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: The PC business.
<A - Meg Whitman>: Are you looking for the – what happened to PCs in January?
<A - Dion Weisler>: The long-term view I think was his question.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: All right, why don't you take that then?
<A - Meg Whitman>: Was it...? Okay, yeah, Dion, you can talk about the long-term view that you have.
<A - Dion Weisler>: Yeah, so look, I think in general we're pretty aligned with the industry projections of the Personal
Systems market, which suggests sort of low single digit growth. We believe that PC units will be in small decline, but
there are pockets of growth across the segment and some segments including Mobility Accessories and Services.
We have seen and expected the slowdown in the commercial segment following the XP refresh that fueled high growth
last year. However, we've seen, to counterbalance that, momentum in the consumer side of the business as consumers
refresh their older PCs.
So looking forward, the market remains competitive. We believe we can continue to gain share in the areas where we
choose to play as the market consolidates. Specifically, we're sort of focused on profitable growth in three areas.
Firstly, we're investing in key growth areas of convertibles, commercial mobility, accessories and services where the
heat is in the market. Secondly, we remain focused on extending our leadership in the Commercial Enterprise and SMB
segments, including education. And then finally, we just continue to do the hard work of detailed customer
segmentation and ensuring that we have the right price value and cost equation set for each market.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And I would say that while we are maniacally focused on the commercial space, in Q1
and what we're seeing is a little bit of refresh in the consumer space.
<A - Dion Weisler>: Right.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And this is where being focused on profitable growth is really important. There's a lot of
bad growth in consumer but there's also good growth. And one of the things that I just want to make sure that people
are clear on is that we don't get hung up on the margin rate. If we can go after good units in the consumer space across
HP Stream, Bing, Chromebook, and we can deliver incremental margin dollars, then we'll go after that. And we
definitely saw some real opportunities in Q1. It helped us gain pretty significant share on the consumer side, while also

The next question will come from Aaron Rakers of Stifel Nicolaus, please go ahead.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the Industry Standard Server
segment and where we stand on the Grantley or the Gen9 server cycle. So what have you seen so far? Where are you at
in that cycle? And what's your expectations for that product cycle relative to, not just the Grantley cycle, but also the
Windows Server expiration through the course of this year?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So specifically with respect to the Gen9, the ramp in Gen9 is off to a terrific start. It is
actually one of the fastest ramps that we've seen. It's certainly ramping faster and better than Gen8. What we see in the
product lineup in Gen9, which is different than Gen8, is that basically we've got a great entry product all the way up to
the high end. So we're very pleased with the progress. You saw that help drive a lot of growth in Industry Standard
Servers, 9% year-over-year in constant currency and we expect that that will continue to ramp basically through the
year.
In terms of the kind of Windows 2003 refresh, it's starting, but it is not a material impact at this point. It's really just
beginning. We do expect that that will ramp as we go through fiscal 2015, but it was not a major factor at all in the
performance that we delivered in Industry Standard Servers this quarter. The combination of Gen9 and the refresh cycle
makes us fairly bullish on Industry Standard Servers kind of throughout the rest of 2015.
<A - Meg Whitman>: And you might talk a little bit about the margin work we've done that business.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: True. Good point. We have done – the margins have improved very significantly, the
gross margins in Industry Standard Servers this quarter. We've done a great job of driving product costs down, taking
advantage of some favorable commodity pricing as well. But it's really been hard work at driving the right cost
structure combined with the opportunity to drive attach. So in ASPs, we've got double digit increases in ASPs in
Industry Standard Server, and that's because the Gen9 ProLiant server basically drives a lot of memory and storage
attach, which is obviously great for margins.
<A - Meg Whitman>: The last thing I'd say is I think we're really well positioned to take advantage of the Windows
2003 refresh, just as we were from the XP migration in the PC business. We actually modeled the program after the XP
program. And that has been helped by our adjustment to our coverage models in the United States and APJ and Europe.
So, I'm with Cathie, I think we feel really pretty good about that business for the remainder of the year, and I think
we're very well positioned, and the Gen9 server was dead on from a market perspective.
<A - Jim Bergkamp>: Thanks, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
And the final question will be from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much for taking my question. Cathie, can you talk a bit about how we
should think about free cash flow for 2016? And what I'm trying to figure out is, you say $750 million for foreign tax, I
think the total was $900 million. So, would sort of the offset of the credits and the costs in 2016 kind of balance
themselves out, and then theoretically restructuring somewhat through, so maybe we get back sort of to that normal
cadence of – I'm sure you probably don't want to put a number on it – but just to the extent that you can, give us some
idea of puts and takes that we should think about as we look to 2016, since obviously we're going to cut our 2015 cash
flow estimate pretty significantly.

<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. The biggest headwind to free cash flow this year over last year is the cash
conversion cycle, basically, going back to 10-12 days. And I think it's important to understand that the reason why it
goes back to 10-12 days is because we are taking what is now our strong balance sheet and leveraging that balance
sheet to drive shareholder value by making tradeoffs across the P&L and the balance sheet. That's what is driving the
10-12 days. But once we get to that 10-12 days, the year-on-year compare for 2016 and that headwind is significantly
reduced. So that's one of the big kind of tailwinds to cash flow.
You're absolutely right, the separation costs are going to come down. And the separation costs, it's anticipated to be
$1.3 billion in fiscal 2015 and about $500 million in fiscal 2016. We don't think there's separation CapEx. The foreign
taxes will turn to credits. I don't know how much we're going to get in credits in fiscal 2016, but certainly you don't
have the headwind of basically $750 million. So I think those are – and then currency, we'll have to see what happens
from a currency perspective, exactly what will happen. But obviously you wouldn't have another step down unless the
currency moves against us again.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: And is there any change – sorry, go ahead.
<A - Meg Whitman>: I was just going to say, Shannon, and obviously towards the end of the year as we get close to
actually the legal separation of these two companies, we'll be very explicit about the balance sheet that each company
has and the earnings, revenue growth, free cash flow of each company. So as we head into 2016, we'll be able to give
you the kind of guidance that we gave when we were one company. We'll just do it for two.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Any change to your cash usage this year, given the lower cash generation?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Are you specifically asking about capital allocation? Because I would love to address
that.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Yes, that's exactly what I was asking.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, our commitment to basically provide at least 50% of our free cash flow this year back
to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends is still intact. And in fact, if you do the math on Q1, in
Q1 we repurchased shares to the tune of about $1.6 billion. About $750 million of that is basically making up for the
shortfall that we had in 2014 from our commitment. So we've got about $850 million done in share repurchase for
fiscal 2015.
If you actually then look out over the course of the year and forecast what you think the dividends are going to be,
you'll come pretty rapidly to the conclusion that we are at or darn close to hitting 50% of free cash flow already, in
terms of returns to shareholder. And what is important is that our guidance is – our commitment is at least 50% of free
cash flow will be returned to shareholders.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.
Meg Whitman
Great, well, thank you very much. I think we're out of time. Thank you very much for joining us.
I think we feel very strongly that the turnaround is on track. There is progress. You can see it in terms of margin
expansion across all of the major lines of business. You can see it in growth in areas of the company that I think people
were not sure we would turn around like Industry Standard Servers and PCs. So lots of progress, lots more work to do.
And obviously the macroeconomic environment, largely currency, is a headwind that disproportionately affects HP, but
overall we feel really good about the operational execution of the company. So thank you for joining us.
