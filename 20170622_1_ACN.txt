MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Accenture's third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. At
this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be
given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the conference over to Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Angie Park. Please go
ahead.
Angie Park
Thank you, Ryan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings announcement.
As Ryan just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.
With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief
Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me
quickly outline the agenda for today's call.
Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial details, including the
income statement and balance sheet for the third quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market
positioning before David provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2017. We will then
take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements, or
net revenues.
Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call including our business outlook are forward-looking, and as such are
subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's
news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other SEC

During today's call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in
our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, Angie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
This was a rather strong quarter for Accenture. We delivered revenue growth in the upper end of our guided range, and
again, gained significant market share. I'm particularly pleased with our very strong new bookings for the quarter and
year to date, which demonstrate that our services and capabilities continue to be both highly relevant to our clients and
very differentiated in the marketplace. We generated very strong cash flow for the quarter and returned substantial cash
to shareholders, all while continuing to make significant investments to drive future growth.
Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We delivered excellent new bookings of $9.8 billion dollars. We grew
revenues 7% in local currency to $8.9 billion with broad-based growth once again across the different dimensions of
our business. We delivered earnings per share of $1.52 on an adjusted basis, an 8% increase. Operating margins was
15.5% on an adjusted basis, consistent with the third quarter last year. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.7
billion, and we returned approximately $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment
of our semi-annual dividend.
So, we had another quarter, and as we enter the fourth quarter, I feel very confident that we are well positioned to
deliver our business outlook for the year.
Now, let me hand over to David who will review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thanks, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call.
As Pierre mentioned, we were pleased with our third quarter results which were in the range we expected and position
us very well to achieve our full-year financial guidance. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I thought it would
be useful to highlight how we're delivering on an essential aspect of our growth strategy and our model for driving
superior shareholder value.
You've heard me say many times previously that our growth strategy was conceived with an important objective in
mind, which is to create durability in our revenue growth at a level which is consistent above market, thereby taking
share and strengthening our position as a market leader. And against that objective, we've created a diverse business
that spans 13 industry groups, 15 geographic markets, 5 businesses which has created a powerful growth model in both
scale and durability.
Our third quarter and year-to-date results are good illustration of our growth model in action where being a market
leader across many dimensions of the market has resulted in consistent growth levels that we estimate are more than
two times the rate of growth of the basket of publicly traded companies. And importantly, we've delivered these results
in a highly dynamic environment, which is exactly the way our growth strategy is intended to work.
With that said, let me also comment on a few of the highlights in the context of our three financial imperatives for
driving shareholder value. Net revenue growth of 7% local currency in the third quarter continued to be highlighted by
strong double-digit growth in all three areas of the New, including digital-, cloud-, and security-related services.

We continue to see positive growth in most geographic markets and industries. And while we saw encouraging signs in
several areas of pressure previously noted, we did experience lower-than-expected revenues in Health & Public Service
in North America. At the same time, we continue to be very pleased with momentum in Europe and the growth markets
which, combined, deliver 10% growth in the quarter.
Operating margin on an adjusted basis of 15.5% in the third quarter was consistent with last year and resulted in 20
basis points of expansion on a year-to-date basis. This level of margin expansion continues to include significant
investments in our business and our people. And on a year-to-date basis, we've delivered very strong earnings per share
growth of 10% over FY 2016 adjusted EPS. And free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the quarter and $2.7 billion year to
date keeps us on a trajectory to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year while returning at least
$4.2 billion cash to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.
And we continue to invest significantly to acquire scale and capability in key growth areas, with a year-to-date capital
investment of $1.2 billion across [ph] 27 (7:10) transactions. So we're pleased with our overall results in the third
quarter, which continue to demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flow.
With that said, let's get into the details of the quarter, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9.8 billion for
the quarter. Consulting bookings were $5.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $4.6 billion,
also with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were very pleased with our new bookings which represent 8% growth in local
currency, reflecting the second highest level of new bookings in our history with a record high in consulting bookings.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $8.87 billion, a 5% increase in USD and 7% in local
currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2% compared with the 2.5% impact provided in our
business outlook last quarter. Our consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local
currency. Outsourcing revenues were $4 billion, up 6% in USD and 7% in local currency.
Looking at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our five business dimensions, growth was led by operations
which posted double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter, and application services which delivered high
single-digit growth. Both operations and application services growth was fueled by significant rotation to the New.
Strategy and consulting services combined continue to grow low-single digits. Across those businesses, the dominant
driver continues to be strong double-digit growth in the New with all three components, digital, cloud and security,
growing double digits as well.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups, Products led all operating groups with 15% growth, driven by strong
growth across all industries and geographies led by consumer goods, retail and travel services.
Financial Services grew 6% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in banking and capital markets globally. And
overall, strong growth in both Europe and the growth markets.
Resources grew 4% and returned to positive growth this quarter as expected, reflecting growth across all geographies.
Globally, we saw very strong growth in chemicals and natural resources and good growth in utilities while the
challenges in energy continued.
Communications, Media & Technology also grew 4%, reflecting strong double-digit growth in software and platforms,
which more than offset roughly flat growth in the other two industries. We saw solid overall growth in North America
and very strong growth in the growth markets, partially offset by continued contraction in Europe.
Finally, H&PS came in lower than expected at 2% growth, as we did not see the uptick that we anticipated in both
public service and health in North America. Our North America business was negatively impacted by slower than
expected decision-making and initiation of new projects due to continued uncertainty on healthcare legislation and state
and federal budgets. We now expect these factors to continue to impact our business at least through the fourth quarter.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32.8% compared to 31.9% in the same period last
year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1%, consistent with the third quarter last year. General and
administrative expense was 6.2% compared to 5.3% for the same period last year.

This quarter, we recorded a settlement charge related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan, consistent with my
comments in March. This $510 million charge decreased quarter three operating margin by 570 basis points, lowered
our quarter three tax rate by 7.2%, and decreased net income by $312 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.47.
The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results.
Operating income was $1.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.5% adjusted operating margin, consistent with
quarter three last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 26.5%
for the same period last year.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.52 compared with EPS of $1.41 in the third quarter last year. Our days services
outstanding were 41 days compared to 42 days last quarter and 41 days in the third quarter last year.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.8 billion net
of property and equipment additions of $136 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $3.4 billion compared with $4.9
billion at August 31.
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed
4.9 million shares for $589 million at an average price of $120.50 per share. At May 31, we had $3.7 billion of share
repurchase authority remaining.
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 15, 2017, we made our second semi-annual dividend payment for fiscal 2017 in
the amount of $1.21 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.6 billion.
So with three quarters in the books, we feel good about our results to date, and we're working hard to deliver quarter
four and another successful year.
Now, let me turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David.
Our strong results for the quarter and year to date demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth
strategy. We are successfully driving the business transformation at Accenture while at the same time consistently
delivering above-market performance. Today, the breadth of capabilities we provide end to end is truly unique in the
marketplace, and we are well positioned to compete at scale in each of our five businesses, driving synergies across
them to deliver value and business outcomes for our clients.
We continue to rotate our business to the New, digital, cloud, and security-related services, which again grew at a very
strong double-digit rate in the quarter, and now account for 50% of total revenue. I am absolutely delighted that we
have achieved this significant milestone for our business so rapidly. Our rotation to these new high-growth areas, the
differentiation of our capabilities in the market, and the diversity of our business have enabled us to continue to gain
significant market share.
The need to go digital remains a top priority for our clients, and we're investing aggressively to drive innovation and
deliver digital transformation. A great example is the capability we have built in Accenture Interactive. And I am again
delighted that for the second year in a row, Advertising Age has named Accenture Interactive the largest provider of
digital marketing services, both globally and in the U.S.
Accenture Interactive is working with many of the world's leading brands to transform the customer experience. As an
illustration, with Carnival, the cruise operator, we are helping develop a new platform using wearable technology, the
Internet of Things, and analytics to transform the guest experience with intelligent personalization. Carnival will be
able to anticipate every passenger's preferences, likes, and needs.

And we continue to broaden the services we provide through Accenture Interactive. In the third quarter, we acquired
two creative and design agencies in Australia, The Monkeys and Maud. And we acquired Kunstmaan in Belgium to
expand our digital and user experience capabilities.
Into that digital and highly connected world, security is essential. And we are building a market-leading security
capability to help clients become more resilient. I'm pleased that in the third quarter, we saw very strong double-digit
growth in our security business, and we are bringing deep and differentiated expertise to our clients. We are working
with a California-based utility to protect its critical assets, including nuclear power plants, through our expertise in
cybersecurity as well as identity and access management.
Increasingly, the work we do is enabled more and more by new IT, including automation, robotics, and intelligent
platforms. We are helping a global healthcare company embrace digital across its entire enterprise. Our team is using
Accenture myWizard, our intelligent automation platform, to improve application quality and productivity. We are
working with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to modernize their enterprise applications using Agile
and DevOps software development.
And during the quarter, we expanded our capabilities in intelligent automation with the acquisition of Genfour in the
UK. And earlier this month we acquired SolutionsIQ, a leading provider of Agile services, adding some of the most
experienced Agile coaches in the industry to our team.
We continue to hold a unique position in the technology ecosystem as the leading partner of both the established
providers and emerging players. Just last week, Microsoft named Accenture its SI Partner of the Year for the 10th year
in a row. In May, we received three SAP Pinnacle Awards, more than any other company, for our work in helping
clients design, deployed, and manage SAP enterprise systems.
And we have expanded our collaboration with SAP to co-innovate, co-develop, and jointly go to market with new
solutions that combine our industry expertise and analytics capabilities with SAP Leonardo, a new system that
integrates digital technologies including machine learning, analytics, and Internet of Things.
Turning now to the geographic dimension of our business and our results for the quarter. In North America, we
delivered revenue growth of 3% in local currency driven by United States. As David mentioned, this was below our
expectations given the increased uncertainty in the marketplace in Health & Public Service related to healthcare
legislation and state and federal budgets. In Europe, I am very pleased that we have now the strong performance,
growing revenue 9% in local currency driven primarily by double-digit growth in the United Kingdom, Germany, and
France.
And in growth market, we delivered another excellent quarter with 13% growth in local currency, led by very strong
double-digit growth in Japan as well as double-digit growth in Australia as well as in Singapore.
Before I hand it back to David, I want to take a moment to acknowledge some of the external recognition we have
received for our brand and differentiated strategy. And again, we never take this for granted.
I am delighted that for the 12th year in a row, we are recognized on BrandZ's list of the top 100 most valuable global
brand. And for the sixth consecutive year, we were included in Forbes ranking of the top global brands. We improved
our rankings and drove significant increases in brand value on both lists. And for the second year in a row, we were
among the top 25 companies on the Barron's 500, and we were also included on Barron's list of most respected
companies.
I strongly believe that over the years we have built a durable business model for Accenture based on two major
building blocks. First, our accelerated rotation to the New, which enhances our relevance to clients. And second, our
highly diverse portfolio of business, which enables us to drive durable performance over cycle of uncertainty and
volatility. And that is why, looking ahead, I remain very confident in our business strategy and our market position.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David?

David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre.
Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect revenues to be in the range of
$8.85 billion to $9.10 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 0.5% compared to the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2016, and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency.
For the full fiscal year 2017, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the
impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 1% compared to fiscal 2016. For the full fiscal 2017, we
now expect our net revenues to be in the range of 6% to 7% growth in local currency over fiscal 2016.
Our operating margin on an adjusted basis, we now expect fiscal year 2017 to be 14.8%, a 20-basis-point expansion
over fiscal 2016 results. We now expect our annual effective tax rate on an adjusted basis to be in the range of 22.5% to
23.5%.
Our earnings per share on an adjusted basis, we now expect full-year diluted EPS for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of
$5.84 to $5.91 or 9% to 11% growth over adjusted fiscal 2016 results.
For the full fiscal 2017, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion,
property and equipment additions to be in the range of $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $4 billion
to $4.3 billion. We continue to expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also
continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1%, as we remain
committed to returning substantial portion of cash to shareholders.
And finally, for the full year, we now expect to invest in the range of $1.8 billion in acquisitions.
With that, let's open it up, so we can take your questions. Angie?
Angie Park
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants possible
to ask a question. Ryan, would you provide instructions for those on the call?
Q&A
Operator
Okay. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Just let me start by asking about bookings. Bookings were
good and in line with where we were at. You said it would improve in the second half, it did in the third quarter. Do
you expect that momentum to carry into the fourth quarter? Have you replenished the pipeline, et cetera, going into
4Q?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, we feel – hey, Tien-Tsin, by the way, we feel good about our bookings position in the
fourth quarter, and we expect to have another very good quarter of bookings. So we think that momentum does
continue.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Okay. And then, on just the New revenue here versus the, I guess you want to call it, legacy
or the non-New, any surprise in the trend there? Just thinking about the math, and if there's been any change in
momentum in either.

<A - David P. Rowland>: No. I would say on that front, it's really been more of the same. Our growth in the New
continues to go at very, very high levels, well above 30% growth in the quarter, which is what we've seen pretty
consistently this year. The market demand is tremendous, and it plays extremely well to the investments that we've
made over the last several years now in building capabilities to be the leader in that part of the marketplace. So we are
extremely pleased. It is broad based literally across our operating groups, our 15 geographic units. And if you look at
the three components of digital, cloud and security, again, very strong double-digit growth really across the board. So
we couldn't be more pleased with what we see in that part of our business.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.
Operator
Next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey. Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: I was curious about your efforts on the acquisition front. Obviously, you're providing all your
cash flow back to investors, and therefore, using the cash on your balance sheet to fund your fairly aggressive
acquisition program. At what point do you hit a level where you desire to have your cash?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I think – and we've talked about this before, Ed, that we are fortunate that with the strength
of our overall financials, including our balance sheet, we have a lot of levers at our disposal as we manage our business
really for many years to come. When we look at our need to acquire critical skills and capabilities in important growth
areas in a market, we don't see that changing, certainly, over the next three years. And so we think that's going to
continue to be an important part of our investment strategy. We think it'll be an important part of an engine for growth
overall. And ultimately for us, as you know, this was all about quickly assimilating these capabilities and driving
organic growth over time. So we really see more of the same with our acquisition strategy going forward. And we think
we have the financial flexibility to accommodate that while also returning cash to shareholders.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I mean not much to add, I think that it's extremely clear strategy at Accenture, which is all
about rotating to the New. And in order to enable this strategy, we've set very clear financial context we shared with all
of you on how we're going to allocate our cash and our free cash flow with the spread, at the same time, investing more
than ever to the transformation of Accenture to build the relevant services of the future and create durable performance
over the next cycle of change, and at the same time, continuing with very – I guess, very good return-to-shareholder
approach, both in term of share buyback and in term of dividends.
So we believe that this strategy is playing very well. And as David mentioned, we still have opportunities to invest even
more should that be required, leveraging more our balance sheet one way or the other. So I feel extremely good with
where we are from an investment standpoint, from a financial strength standpoint, and from our strategic allocation of
cash.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: My other related question is around the assimilation of these employees. These are generally
smaller, more entrepreneurial firms that generally have a different character of employee than the traditional
Accenture-trained and developed person. Can you give us any sense for the attrition at these acquired companies sort of
relative to the base, and how you're managing that? Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thanks for the question because it was [indiscernible] (28:44) when we decided our new
strategy of rotating to the New, that was clearly a big question we had in front of us. We benefited from Accenture
from a very strong culture, as you know very well, based on what we've been doing for multiple decades. And when
you're rotating to the New, and the New is so different in term of human capital, we're talking about the millennium.
But again, in terms of disciplines such as design-led thinking, such as experience-driven projects, such as prototyping,

such as being more Agile, DevOps, no doubt you need to attract people who are going to be different from where you
are.
And simply said, we make what I think is a very profound and important evolution in our industry, which is creating
this concept of at Accenture, we have a culture of cultures. So we celebrate the diversity of the cultures. So we are
extremely respectful of the culture of Fjord which is our design, digital marketing organization, now with 1,000 people,
we are the largest digital design studio in the world.
We are extremely respectful of the people we're hiring from security. As you know very well and as we've noted
already, people are different in the security specs and they're working like a tribe around their own discipline, and we
are extremely respectful to keep that culture. That's why we created end-to-end Accenture Security under the leadership
of Kelly Bissell, an incredibly strong security leader, oversight by Omar Abbosh, our Chief Strategy Officer. So we
develop this concept of culture of cultures, very different from this old and I think an outdated concept of one culture.
On the other hand, we are extremely stringent on our values, and we're making a big difference around cultures. They
have to be different. It is what's bringing richness in our company, and innovation. But the values shouldn't be
compromised and are not for negotiation. And the values at Accenture, we will never negotiate our respect for
individual, inclusion and diversity, ethics, compliance, client-first.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Stewardship.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Stewardship, and all of this has nothing to do with culture. It's just the appropriate business
and personal behavior you and I and everybody on the planet should develop. And I think we've been very good in
creating and developing this culture of cultures concept. Right, David? All the integration we made, all – and I'm not
saying that lightly – have been successful.
<A - David P. Rowland>: We carefully manage the retention of the people in these companies that we acquire, and
our performance really over the last three years in terms of retaining talent has been very good.

And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan C. Bergin>: Good morning, thank you. As the New becomes a majority share of your business, how
should we think about potential changes in corporate revenues trajectory or particularly margin expansion? Do you
foresee any inflection in either over the medium term?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Again, I will stop short of saying anything that would imply guidance for next year or
beyond. But I would say that broadly speaking, if you look at two of our three overriding financial objectives, the first
one being to drive durable growth which is consistently above the market, as I've said, taking share and extending our
position as a market leader.
And then the second overriding objective, which is consistent modest margin expansion while investing and increasing
scale in our business and driving EPS growth faster than revenue growth. We remain committed to those as multiyear
objectives that we work very hard to achieve. And I think the rotation to the New creates more opportunity for
achieving those as opposed to a threat. So that I think gives us better positioning and a better opportunity to continue to
deliver on those over time.
<Q - Bryan C. Bergin>: Okay. And just to follow up then, just as far as expanding addressable markets, the Interactive
business I thought was a great example of gaining new access into an area within the CMO office. Are there other areas

that you're potentially looking at within client wallets that are logical extensions that you might be targeting?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Security is another one. With the business results with Accenture Security, clearly we are
expanding our access to new leaders. Given the depth and breadth of our services, you're absolutely right. It is our
ambition to increase the coverage of the leaders we might serve with clients from the CEO, the CFO, the COO, the
CIO. Now the Chief Digital Officer, with the launch of Accenture Digital, there are new leaders under this terminology.
And we want to be the top-of-world choice for the newly appointed CEOs, which should be quite a natural act. You
mentioned the CMOs we're gathering with Accenture's entire team, and we have all the business leaders in the different
parts of the business.
So if I'm looking at Accenture, we have now certainly with the five businesses we have, but in these businesses, you
have other activities such as analytics, interactive, mobility, cloud, security. I could mention Accenture Credit Services
we have in the U.S., which is providing access in banks to credit part of the organization, and I've mentioned a lot. I
guess and I would claim that we're certainly the organization in professional services with today the broader access to
any client leadership group.

Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hi. Good morning, Lisa.
<Q - Lisa Dejong Ellis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David P. Rowland>: How are you?
<Q - Lisa Dejong Ellis>: I'm good, so question just around the mix of business. So I notice GDN mix down-ticked
slightly this quarter. That's quite unusual. I think that's the first time in years that's happened. And at the same time, you
had a really strong head count growth quarter at over 10%. But then, David, in your comments you called out that
you're seeing very strong growth in the New in areas like application services, which suggests more like field-related
activities which I would associate with offshore.
So a two-part question coming out of that. One, with the strong head count growth and GDN mix stabilizing, are we
going to see an acceleration in revenue per head that might cause some break in the linearity in the business? And then
also just secondarily, can you just talk a little bit about the mix of the type of work you're seeing in the New as it gets to
be over 50% of the business, and if that's fundamentally different in terms of mix of service lines relative to the core?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Maybe I'm going to start with providing our strategy direction on this. We're working
extremely hard, as you know, at Accenture on robotic automation and bringing intelligent capabilities to significantly
improve our productivity, especially where we have large-scale operations, so with technology and in operations. So
we're working hard on what you said, how we're moving forward, we're going to have less direct correlation between
revenue and head count.
And clearly, the big game on this is to accelerate our investments in robotic automation and intelligent services, which
is exactly where Bhaskar Ghosh for Accenture Technology and Debbie Polishook for Accenture Operations are
working extremely hard. And we're starting to see some very encouraging results where we could drive more revenues
with a bit less people in some parts of Accenture operations and in some part of our BPO. We're starting to feel this
point of inflection. Certainly, we need another year or 18 months to see whether this trend might accelerate and change
the dynamic between revenue and head count growth, which is something of course we are pursuing systematically.

On the second question, what is the complexion of our work in terms of the New? The good news is we are rotating
everything to the New, strategy, consulting, digital across technology and operations. And all our services in the New
are growing very well. Strategy and consulting growth in the New is...
<A - David P. Rowland>: Double digit.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: ...is double digits, and as well is driving significant growth in Accenture technology and in
our platforms. If I'm looking at the business, we're driving in analytics through SAP HANA and tomorrow with SAP
Leonardo is driving significant growth in the new SAP, in the new Microsoft, in the new Oracle, and I can mention
others. But as well, it is creating activity in operations. And think about what we are doing in customer analytics linked
to Accenture Analytics or to Accenture Interactive, it's driving business with our platform-as-a-service in term of
analytics, what we're calling Accenture Analytics Insight Platform. This is a service which is directly linked to the New
and to the new services we're providing from an analytical standpoint. So it's really – the New is driving growth in each
of our five businesses in a very meaningful way, and we love that.
<A - David P. Rowland>: And, Lisa, I would say that you may remember that it was the third quarter of last year and
then again in the fourth quarter where I had made comments that we were starting to see an improving trend in the
progression of revenue per billable head. And so you asked, will we start to see that? I think we have seen instances of
that if you looked over the last three or four quarters. The other thing, just to remind you and others who are looking at
the head count numbers, GDN includes our locations around the world, including GDN head count in, let's say, the
more mature markets. And so GDN is in the United States is an example. It's not just India and the Philippines.
<Q - Lisa Dejong Ellis>: Terrific. Thanks. And just one – just a quick follow-up, Pierre, I think on your comment
there on the New. So would you characterize, at this point, if you just compared this year versus maybe like this time
last year or two years ago, that the mix of work in the New now is much more diverse across your service lines, you're
fully into what I call more like build and run activities?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Absolutely right. And I think we see – and I'm pleased with that, we see this New maturing.
So like old services, you have kind of a maturity curve where you're starting with more pioneering, strategic
consulting-rich programs, kind of prototyping in the early phase of the maturity curve. What we see is now all these
new capabilities. I'm thinking about interactive, mobility, analytic, cloud, security – soon come into traffic artificial
intelligence, blockchain, and immersive reality, and certainly in the near future quantum computing. All of these new
capabilities are getting more mature, are driving on balance bigger programs. And as we're moving from small
prototyping to bigger programs, certainly it is expanding in several service lines from strategy to consulting, but as well
to technology and to operations.
This business is maturing very well at Accenture, with a positive effect in all our five businesses, if you will. And
indeed, we see more bigger deals, which is a sign of a market maturing.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Okay. Thank you, Lisa.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hi. Good morning.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: I wanted to ask about the Accenture business dimensions. The growth rates there have
surprised me. I guess on one hand, app services which grew mid-single digits in fiscal year 2016 has gone up to
high-single digits. And I know there's a lot of worries in the marketplace about a secular decline in that business, so
that's been a surprise on the positive end. And then, on the other hand, strategy and consulting, which grew double
digits in fiscal year 2016, is kind of hovering below kind of my expectations at low-single digits. So just trying to
understand the strength in app services versus the weakness in strat and consulting.

<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I think when you – I'll make a few comments and Pierre may have some as well. But
first of all, when you look at app services, it's important to focus on the point that our growth is coming from the higher
value, application engineering, systems integration type work that is driven by the adoption of new IT and this rotation
to the new. And so to some extent, it kind of ties back to Lisa's question and Pierre's answer is that what you're starting
to see as the adoption rate of new IT and digital broadly is increasing, you're starting in our business to see more
systems integration, application work associated with the implementation of digital technologies, new IT, et cetera, and
I think that is really what's driving our application services.
We've said before, Pierre has said many times, that our strategy in app services is to rapidly grow and expand in the SI
piece. The application outsourcing is a different marketplace. It is largely commoditized. And we will continue to have
an application maintenance footprint, but our application services business is really all about the systems integration,
application engineering, enabling the adoption of new IT and digital technologies for our clients. And that's reflected in
the pickup in growth rate.
Maybe just one more comment on the strategy and consulting combined, again, that can ebb and flow. Pierre also
alluded earlier, and it is worth noting again, is that you really have to decompose the strategy and consulting number to
really understand what's going on. And if you look at our strategy and consulting business that is – relates to projects in
the New, that part of strategy and consulting is growing mid-teens. So let's say, in the 15 kind of percent range, so it's
very, very strong growth for those services related to enabling the New with our clients. The area that is not as robust
right now, let's say, is the more traditional strategy and consulting that's not specifically tied to this rotation to the New.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up on contributions of acquisitions, how much
did the acquisitions contribute to the quarterly revenue growth? And I know we talked about 2.5 points for the back
half of the year. I don't know, since you took up the amount that you're going to spend on acquisitions, I think it went
up a little bit to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion, if that changed anything for the outlook. Thanks so much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: That doesn't materially change the number because obviously we're acquiring these – let's
say, that increase is more in the back of the last three months of the year, so that has more of an impact on 2018 than it
does this year. Having said that, we still think we're going to be at roughly in the ballpark of 2% for the full year.
Previously I've said the back half of the year would be 2.5%. It will be just incrementally kind of above that, but not
materially above that. So materially...
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: In the third...
<A - David P. Rowland>: ...it's consistent with what I've said before, slightly higher in the back half of the year than
the 2.5%.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Thanks so much. And just curious on the third quarter itself, was it up to 2.5 points, so
far? Or not quite yet?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, in that zone.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Thanks so much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.

<Q - James Schneider>: Hello. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe
comment on the North America piece of the business, what you're hearing from clients just broadly speaking. Can you
maybe just kind of give us a sense about whether the North America slowdown was purely isolated to the Health &
Public Service area? Or what you're hearing from clients generally and whether you expect that to be kind of like a
one-off, one-quarter thing or something that could continue for a couple quarters?
<A - David P. Rowland>: First of all, as it relates to our expectations – and then Pierre may add some comments as
well, but let me just deal with the results relative to our expectations. So we had seen slower growth in H&PS in quarter
one and quarter two. You'll remember quarter two was at 2% which is where we ended up in quarter three. We had
expected, not based on hope but based on what we felt was kind of tangible evidence in the second quarter, that we
were going to see an uptick in growth in the third quarter and the second half of the year, and that's what I called out 90
days ago. What we saw was that that uptick, if you will, or that freeing up of initiation of new projects and let's say a
return to more normal decision-making patterns on contracting new work, that just simply did not improve as we had
expected.
And so if you look at North America and the difference between where we landed and where we expected to land, the
difference is the vast majority of that is in Health & Public Service for the reasons I mentioned in the script. It's the
difference between North America growth being at 3% and 5% order of magnitude. And it was the difference – it was
probably a point of growth – it was a point of growth at the Accenture level in total, so it was meaningful. Having said
that, we have a very strong Health & Public Service practice. And at some point, the logjam will break and work will
be initiated. And we'll be right there in the game when that happens. And of course, broadly, in North America, we feel
that way as well.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Absolutely right. And I understand you're asking this question on North America. For me, on
the positive side, we continue to grow more than the market and gaining significant market share in North America
despite the fact that our level of growth is lower. But the level of growth of the market, as we are analyzing it, has been
as well slowing down. Second, our rotation to the New in North America is excellent, and we're going to get closer to
50% as with the rest of Accenture, so we have zero issues in term of executing our strategy. And three, we continue to
invest, so we are not changing our investment profile. And we believe it's the right time to invest, to be prepared for the
future, and to be prepared when the market will pick up again.
Now, what is the situation and indeed a big difference on what we expected three months ago is – you should probably
know, and you're in the U.S., I'm in France, so you probably have certainly a better-informed point of view on this. But
there is an expectation that indeed the new administration will launch critical reforms in order to boost the business and
the economic growth. And this economic reform probably, I would set – the one which are the most important, the
healthcare reform, the tax reform, the trade reform, and anything linked to the infrastructure investments. And all of
these four were the ones supposed to indeed unleash more growth for the business, so the business could invest and
drive more growth. And by driving more growth and driving more investments, we'd have a positive impact.
The fact of the matter is that would – I would say this to be honest, three months ago, because just reading the
observers and all the analyses, we believe that these four reforms would happen reasonably rapidly in the U.S.
And fact of the matter, they are not yet being announced or executed, and so we are in this zone where the business is
still waiting. It's still positive, but waiting for these reforms to happen to invest, and so it has a negative effect,
especially on HPS, which has been the vertical more impacted by this wait-and-see mode on what can happen with the
reform. And we have evidence that indeed these are couple of quarters, the overall profit for the services market in the
U.S. been slowing down. And so to some extent, we are moderating with the market while continuing to do much better
than the market. And so I feel positive that the market will be back because when that happens, we are better positioned
than anyone else, even the investment and the positioning we are taking. So I'm looking at that with my French glasses,
and I encourage the U.S. to accelerate their reform.
<A - David P. Rowland>: And as I said, it's a perfect illustration though of the power of the diversity of our model,
where Europe and the growth markets combined in the third quarter grew double digits, 10%. And so that is
intentionally the way our business is constructed for this exact reason, and so it is working as designed.

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And it's interesting to see – sorry to elaborate, but I think it's important for all the people
listening to the call, because you might wonder why things are doing so well in Europe. We have 9% growth, and you
know it's not vibrant, but I think in Europe, you have less uncertainties now. I think we had good prospect that probably
Germany might reelect Angela Merkel, so it's a pole of stability. I guess the election of Emmanuel Macron in France
has been recognized and celebrated by the market because it's pro-European, so it has created a very positive impact
around whether Europe will disappear or not. I think Germany and France being extraordinary core business is
re-creating a very solid coalition.
And the Brexit thing is moving at its pace, but at least, we know it's going to happen, so it's not an uncertainty. The
uncertainty is what exactly – is it going to be hard, soft, gentle? Probably the European will figure it out as they already
figured it out over centuries. But it's interesting, if you take China, China, I guess not much uncertainty. The President
is very clear on what it is he wants to achieve. He's driving this five years' reform program. So you see what I mean. It's
interesting that there is one place that has a big place in the world where you have this kind of wait for the reforms to
happen, it is currently in the United States, but I'm personally feeling very good that these reforms will happen and the
business will pick up again.
<Q - James Schneider>: That's helpful. Thank you for the color. And just as a quick follow-up, going back to the
M&A question for a second, if you look at the run rate of M&A that you're doing in Q4 of this year, would you expect
that to accelerate incrementally from here and getting into fiscal 2018? And then I think, Pierre, you made an allusion
to using the balance sheet for M&A. Does that imply you're willing to put some debt on the balance sheet to finance
more M&A at this point?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I think as it relates to your last question, we said consistently for as long as I remember that
we always – I mean we're well aware of that being an option. And given the right circumstances, we would have no
concern about doing that. As we always do, we would make very smart decisions as to when and at what level we do
that. But that is certainly an option that is open to us, and we have no concerns at all about using that option given the
right circumstances.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, I mean, so far we said – with David and I, we are extremely disciplined, and our
financial model is extremely clear and has been communicated to all of you. We expect 20% to 30% of our annual
growth to be driven by acquisitions, so our growth is 70% to 80% organic. Let's be clear and if we confirm that, and
20% to 70% of the annual growth might come through acquisition depending on the opportunities. These things are
lumpy, but that is old. And we expect that anything between 20% to 35% every year of our free cash flow would be
dedicated to acquisition, and the rest, as we do, would be return to our shareholders in a program which I think is
extremely attractive to all of you with the mix of share buyback and dividend. So this is our ongoing thesis from a
financial algorithm, if you will.
Now, we have opportunities by leveraging more the balance sheet if we have any relevant opportunities that would
bring differentiation, that would bring more transformation, more leadership in the New. In some spaces, it could be
artificial intelligence, immersive reality, quantum computing, or say what to make some significant steps. But so far,
we are with our ongoing thesis I just mentioned before, and we are very pleased with where we are. And I'm very
pleased that we have what we need if we have for good reason to move faster or make different transactions.

<Q - David J. Koning>: I guess first of all, just when we think of the New, I think you said about 50% of revs now.
When we look back, a year ago it's about 40% of revs. So it's growing like 25% – 30%, something like that, whereas
the rest of the business is declining high-single digits, it looks like. Is that just existing clients that are just shifting their
preferences rather than really some of that old stuff just going away? It's just a shift.
And then I guess second to that, overall growth has decelerated a little bit. Is that because the yield on some of the new
projects are a little less than some of the legacy?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Look, first of all, when you look at overall growth and when we provided guidance of 5% to
8% at the beginning of the year, and of course, we're going to land very solidly within that range, we have said that
growing double digits each and every year is just an unrealistic expectation. We work hard to drive as much growth as
we can. But each and every year, we're not going to drive double-digit growth. And we think that we look at our growth
rate against what the market is growing. And in a market that let's say generally has grown, let's say, anywhere in the
2.5% to 4% range, let's say if you looked over the last two to three years, if we're growing 7% as we are this year, we're
growing two times the rate of the market growth.
And so yes, are we lower than where we were double-digit growth the last two years? We are, but we're growing two
times the rate of overall market growth, which is clearly, clearly the indicator of a leader in the sector. And so if that's
what we're all about, then growth in the 5% to 8% range and where we've got it to for the full year, 6% to 7% growth is
actually quite strong growth in the market.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: We were just reflecting on the – when I'm looking at the performance of the company and we
are in the right place or not, summarizing what we are delivering at Accenture, we said our revenue would be in the
range of 5% to 8%, right, David?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: So far we are at 7%.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Right in the zone. Then the question might be is 7% good or not. The only way to understand
whether 7% is good or not is to compare with the rest of the market.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And we believe that at 7%, we're growing twice the market. And growing twice the market
for a company of our size is an incredible positive results.
Second, part of our philosophy as well. At the same time, our revenues are growing 7%. Our EPS is growing 10%.
We're growing the EPS more than our revenues. And again, I think it's a sign of good financial performance. I
remember that we've said we want to grow EPS at the same rate as our revenues. We are growing EPS even slightly
higher than the revenue which is, of course, an exceptional performance from David. And that, for me, if David is
taking care of the numbers and I'm taking care of the strategy, that's why we are a good duo. For me, if there is a
highlight for this quarter, and I hope that's the one you're going to have to take is this 50%.
There are all sorts of metrics, there are all sorts of numbers there, which I think are all landing in the right place. We're
probably beating our guidance we set three months ago on each and every dimension, and providing extraordinary good
financials. But then, what's important, I think, for all of you and for me, are we executing the strategy which is going to
create a new Accenture which could be competitive for the future? And the answer is yes, that's why I wanted to put
even in the announcement we made for the first time outside in what we're calling the [ph] famous BF (1:01:52) that we
keep the milestone of 50%. And I would like all of us, analysts, investors, because you're putting a lot of confidence on
Accenture, to celebrate this milestone because it's a very big and important milestone for us at Accenture. We will
properly celebrate in Boston with a very nice glass of Coca-Cola or other things, by the way, because we can handle, so
no champagne yet.

But it is very important, jokes apart. Imagine what it is in probably four years, we're rotating 50% of the business of a
company of $35 billion to the New. That's what has been achieved, and we're not going to stop there. We will continue
accelerating because we want by 2020 to have the vast majority of our revenues being in the New. And this might turn,
the 50% was for me, at least there, was for me, the highlight of the quarter. And I hope it is as well something you will
consider extremely important in the successful execution of our strategy, together with the rest of very strong financial
performance.

So that being said, thanks again for joining us on today's call. I mean, needless to say, and with a few words I just said a
sort of conclusion that I and the leadership team of Accenture, we feel good about where we are. And we feel good
about where we are because we continue to build on our strong position in the marketplace, I mean what we have said.
We're rotating our business to the New which is now 50% of our revenues. And again, I would like to pound that
because for me, it's exceptional. We are gaining significant market share, growing, in average, twice as fast as the
market. And I think this is very noticeable in each and every market, if you look at this. North American, Europe and
the growth market.
The minimum is twice the market. In some markets, we're growing much more than twice, sometimes four times the
market. And we continue to gain market share and we continue – and this is where I'm delighted with what we're doing,
we continue to invest in new capabilities to drive future growth and to create the future of that company while
delivering value for all of you but as well for all our stakeholders including our 400,000 people who are working
everyday very hard to transform the company and make Accenture the partner of choice for many of our clients.
We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to
call Angie and the team. All the best, and talk to you very soon.
