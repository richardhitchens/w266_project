My name is Marvin, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's first quarter 2013 financial results
conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a
question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone
has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A
session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.

I think our Q1 performance is a good snapshot of the progress that we are making to deliver results which are
consistent with our objectives for the full year. We also made meaningful advances with our pipeline during the
quarter; notably, the announcement that we achieved the primary endpoint of durable response rate [DRR] for T-VEC,
which is a novel therapy for the treatment of malignant melanoma.
To discuss our quarterly performance and our full-year outlook in greater detail, I'm joined by several members of our
senior leadership team. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will begin with a brief strategic overview. After Bob,
our CFO, Jon Peacock, will review our quarterly results and provide an update on EPS guidance for the year. Tony
Hooper, who is our head of Global Commercial Operations, will provide details on our product performance during the
quarter, followed by Sean Harper, our head of R&D, who will provide a brief pipeline update. We will use slides for
our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email.
Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of
our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert A. Bradway
Okay, good afternoon and thank you for joining our conference call.
With the results that we've just reported for the first quarter, revenues up 5% and earnings per share up 22%, we're on
track to deliver our growth objectives for the full year. In terms of revenues, we expect Enbrel, Sensipar, Prolia, and
XGEVA to be key growth drivers, and underlying demand for these brands remained strong in the first quarter.
International growth is an important element of our long-term strategy. And once again, this quarter we reported strong
growth, with sales up 8% outside of the US.
Our earnings for the quarter reflect favorability on taxes, as Jon will describe, as well as the ongoing benefits from our
recapitalization. Overall, the company is executing well. And for the full year, we expect growth in revenues to lead
growth in expenses.
In February, we talked about the role we expect our pipeline products to play in driving long-term growth and in
particular the eight molecules for which we expect pivotal or registration enabling data by 2016. The data from the first
of these for T-VEC in malignant melanoma were encouraging, and we look forward to sharing additional details with
you at ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] and thereafter.
As you know, we have plans to commercialize six biosimilar molecules, which we expect to be a source of growth for
the company as well. Together with our partners at Actavis, we plan to initiate a pivotal trial for trastuzumab biosimilar
in the second quarter. We will update you on the progress of our other biosimilar molecules as these programs mature.
I want to take just a moment to commend my colleagues in our manufacturing organization for their sustained track
record of producing safe and reliable medicines, and more generally to thank our staff around the world who are
listening to this call. It's their hard work and dedication that enables us to deliver for both patients and shareholders.
Let me turn now to Jon, who will review our financials for the quarter.
Jonathan M. Peacock
Thanks, Bob.
So turning to page four of the presentation, you'll see the headlines for the quarter are that we grew revenues 5% and
earnings per share – adjusted earnings per share at 22%. Product sales, as Bob mentioned, grew at 6%, driven again by
broad strength from Enbrel, from XGEVA, Prolia, Sensipar, and Nplate, and supported by solid performances from

Neulasta and EPOGEN.
You'll also see that operating expenses grew faster than revenues in the quarter. And as Bob has also noted, for the full
year we expect operating expense growth to be at or below revenue growth.
Research and development costs were 18% higher compared to the first half of 2012, reflecting the Phase 3 trials
started more recently, particularly for our PCSK9 molecule, AMG 145. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, R&D costs
were down 7%.
SG&A costs were 8% higher. This was primarily driven by the higher Enbrel profit share payments in the quarter. And
these payments did grow faster than Enbrel sales, reflecting a reduction in third-party royalties, increasing overall
Enbrel profitability.
Net income grew by 16% in the quarter. The biggest contributor was the tax rate. As I outlined at our business review
in February, the first quarter benefited from two significant items. The first was a recognition of the full amount of the
2012 federal R&D tax credit, which was enacted in January of this year. And the second was the resolution of our
federal audits for tax years 2007 to 2009, which enabled us to release provisions that we held against potential
additional liabilities associated with these tax years.
Other expenses were higher in the quarter at $87 million, reflecting interest costs associated with additional debt
balances compared to a year ago, partially offset by income from higher cash balances and higher realized portfolio
gains on our cash investments.
Adjusted EPS grew 22%, benefiting from higher net income and a lower average share count.
Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on page five, we generated $900 million in free cash flows in the
quarter, reflecting higher sales and cash collections, partially offset by higher cash tax payments related to the audit
settlement and other timing issues.
Uses of cash in the quarter included $2.5 billion to repay our convertible bond that matured in February, $400 million
for the quarterly dividend, and $800 million in share repurchases. We repurchased a total of 9 million shares in the
quarter at an average price of $85.03. And we have $1.6 billion remaining under our board authorized share repurchase
program, which we expect to carry us into 2014.
At the end of the quarter, we held $21.3 billion in cash, up almost $2 billion versus a year ago. Our debt balance was
$23.9 billion, up $2.5 billion versus a year ago but $2.6 billion lower than the end of 2012, reflecting repayment of our
convertible bond.
Turning to page six, we are reconfirming our revenue guidance of $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion for the year. On the tax
rate, we now expect our full-year tax rate to be 11% to 12% compared to the prior guidance of 12% to 13%. This
reflects the impact of a higher excise tax on our sales from Puerto Rico. This higher tax was enacted during the quarter
and is effective from July 1 of this year. The tax continues to be creditable against U.S. federal taxes, and the timing of
the credit will be received faster than the charge to the P&L, which passes through inventory and then cost of sales. As
a consequence of this temporarily lower tax rate, we now expect adjusted EPS for the full year to be above the midpoint
of $7.05 to $7.35.
So I'll hand over to Tony now to give you some more color on our product sales during the quarter. Tony?
Anthony C. Hooper
Thanks, Jon. You will find a summary of our global performance for the first quarter on slide number seven.
Product sales grew 6% on a year-over-year basis, with contributions from both the U.S. at 6% year-over-year growth
and the rest of the world at 8% year on year.

Let me now review our first quarter performance for our portfolio. Enbrel continues to be recognized by both
rheumatologists and dermatologists with long track record of both efficacy and safety. As we highlighted in February at
the business review, given its prolonged exclusivity, we will continue to invest in Enbrel to drive growth.
On a year-over-year basis, Enbrel sales grew 11%. Quarter one in-market IMS data shows continued strong demand,
maintaining the 2012 momentum. In fact, quarter over quarter Enbrel held market share in both NRxs and TRxs. The
first quarter, however, was impacted by buying patterns at the end of last year and therefore declined 11% quarter over
quarter. Enbrel remains the value share leader in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments, and we are
confident in its continued growth potential.
Moving now to our pegfilgrastim franchise, Neulasta represents approximately 80% of the sales for this franchise.
Global sales for Neulasta and NEUPOGEN in the first quarter were in line with last year, with modest unit declines
offset by some pricing in the U.S.
EPOGEN was down 2% year on year. You will recall that EPOGEN exited 2012 with a 96% share. When peginesatide
was withdrawn in February of this year, our priority was to communicate conversion protocols and help dialysis
providers successfully transition back to EPOGEN.
At Amgen, serving patients is always our highest priority. I'd like to thank the Amgen team who mobilized over that
weekend to ensure uninterrupted supply and treatment for all patients at affected centers. EPOGEN has a strong
heritage of efficacy and safety and will continue to be an important part of dialysis treatment.
Global Aranesp were down 4% quarter over quarter. Approximately two-thirds of Aranesp sales are outside the U.S.,
and these were relatively flat quarter over quarter. The remaining one-third of sales are in the U.S. and are evenly split
between nephrology and oncology. We saw declines in both of these segments in the U.S.
Sensipar continues on a strong trajectory in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Sensipar sales grew 21%
globally, driven by growth in unit demand, favorable accounting adjustments, and price increases. Vectibix and Nplate
global sales in aggregate were slightly higher year over year. We are actively pursuing reimbursement across Europe
following the recent approval of Vectibix in both first and second-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.
For Prolia, we saw some seasonal softness in the first quarter along with decreases in wholesale inventories. We saw
similar seasonality in the previous two years. Over the last six weeks, however, we have seen a 30% global growth in
sales versus the previous ten weeks.
We are confident in Prolia's potential and have relaunched our DTC television campaign with Blythe Danner in the
U.S. in mid-February this year. The 2012 campaign established Prolia as the most requested post-menopausal
osteoporosis branded product. And when patients requested Prolia, we know they received it more than 90% of the
time.
XGEVA global sales grew 4% quarter over quarter. We continue to grow share globally. In the U.S., our value share
grew by five points to 59% by the end of the first quarter. In addition, our share of treatment-naïve patients continues to
increase. Outside the U.S., XGEVA grew 22% quarter over quarter. Our most recent launches in France and Spain have
been strong, with France achieving 10% share in less than a quarter.
In summary, I believe we are well positioned to achieve our full-year revenue growth objectives.
Let me now hand you now over to Dr. Sean Harper. Sean?
Sean E. Harper
Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon.
This has been another productive quarter for the R&D organization, and our pipeline continues to advance. We've
initiated our Phase 3 program with AMG 416, our intravenous calcimimetic agent for the treatment of secondary

hyperparathyroidism in patients receiving hemodialysis. These data are expected in 2014.
As you'll recall, in March we announced that our Phase 3 study of T-VEC in the setting in metastatic melanoma met its
primary endpoint of durable response rate, defined as the rate of complete or partial response lasting continuously for at
least six months. We also observed an overall survival trend in favor of T-VEC as compared to GM-CSF in a
preplanned interim analysis. Keeping in mind that this is event driven, we expect the primary overall survival analysis,
a secondary endpoint, by the end of this year.
We're excited by the T-VEC results and look forward to sharing the details at an oral session at this year's ASCO
meeting. We're also planning to host an investor event at ASCO this year to discuss data from T-VEC as well as other
programs, including Vectibix, or panitumumab.
Additional analyses of Phase 2 data from AMG 145, our PCSK9 inhibitor for hyperlipidemia, will be presented at the
National Lipid Association meetings in late May in the United States and at the European Atherosclerosis Society
meetings in Europe in early June. Open-label data from our initial experience with AMG 145 in homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia [HoFH] will also be presented at the European Atherosclerosis Society meeting. This will be the
first data from a PCSK9 inhibitor studied in this population. As you may recall, our four pivotal trials of AMG 145 as
monotherapy in combination with statins in statin-intolerant subjects and in subjects with heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia began enrolling in Q1, with the data expected next year. Enrollment also continues in our CV
outcomes study.
We've also begun enrolling a Phase 3 study to determine the effects of AMG 145 treatment on atherosclerotic disease
burden, as measured by intravascular ultrasound, in patients undergoing coronary catheterization.
We continue to expect data on the primary endpoint of progression-free survival from the Phase 3 study of trebananib,
our peptibody antagonist of the angiopoietin access, in recurrent ovarian carcinoma by midyear. The final overall
survival analysis, a secondary endpoint, is currently estimated to occur in 2014, which is shaping up to be a data-rich
year for us.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hey, guys, Thanks for taking my question. So first up, you commented about the EPO
franchise. Can you comment a little bit about the impact of competitors in that franchise? And second on HoFH, so I
think that data is coming a little bit earlier than expected. Maybe you can comment a little about what kind of data
you're going to get on that. Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, Robyn, why don't we take those in two pieces? Sean, do you want to talk first about
the homozygous question? And then, Robyn, we'll try to better understand what you're trying to get at with the EPO
question.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, we don't want to jeopardize our opportunity to present the data on the homozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia population, but it is data from the open-label portion of our study. It has an open-label
portion and then a controlled portion, kind of part A and part B. This is data from the part A.

<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, Robyn, you asked another question about EPO. Can you be a little bit more specific
about what you were looking for us to comment on?
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Right, so you started facing competition initially. Now you're actually freed up from
competition. Maybe you can comment a little bit about how you're thinking about EPO franchise in the second half of
the year. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure. I think Tony summarized it well. But our perspective on EPOGEN is that we
continue to benefit from the long-established track record of safety and efficacy with that product. We think it meets
very well the needs of dialysis patients and providers. As Tony said, we entered the year with 96% market share. And
obviously, with the withdrawal of a competitive product, we expect that to go back to up to 100% market share. But
generally, again, we're very pleased with the performance, the track record, the history of EPOGEN in this
marketplace, and we expect this to continue to be an important product for us and for the providers.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Can you clarify a little bit whether or not you have contracts in place that are affected by
price and whether or not like removal of the competitor actually is a benefit, or whether or not you still keep the price
point?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yes, I can understand the interest in the question, Robyn, but I don't think we're going to
get into details on the contract on the call.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: All right, thank you very much.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, thank you. Let's go to the next question, Marvin, and just remind callers we're going
to try and do one question each so we can get through everybody on the call.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Lazard Capital.
<Q - Joshua E. Schimmer>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you can discuss the impact of healthcare
reform in this quarter as well as what you expect to see for the duration of the year and then any changes into 2014 on
that front. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, Josh, are you referring specifically to sequestration?
<Q - Joshua E. Schimmer>: The whole shebang, including sequestration.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, with respect to sequestration, obviously, there wasn't any direct effect in the first
quarter, and we're not expecting any material impact from the sequestration if it remains in place through the balance of
the year. Tony, do you want to talk about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the business for first quarter?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So we saw little to no impact at all. And our guidance at the moment includes any changes
in the Affordable Care Act between now and the year end, yes.
<Q - Joshua E. Schimmer>: And then in 2014?
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: We'll give guidance at a later time on 2014, Josh.

<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Yes, thanks. So maybe you could discuss your assessment of where regulators are or your
conversations broadly are on the path of biosimilars. We really haven't heard anything out of the regulators, but yet
you're ready to basically start a pivotal study for trastuzumab. So help us connect the dots on what you know and what
you have to do to run a study and why that would be good enough for approval. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, thanks, Michael. Sean, why don't you respond to his question?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, I think we've actually had – as you might imagine, we've been having a lot of discussion
with regulators around the world about this topic, biosimilars, given our expertise in developing and manufacturing
these products, biologics. And I think that we've been having quite high-quality interactions with regulators, including
FDA, around what we would need to do to successfully develop and market biosimilars. The bar is high, as it should
be, and we feel that we're particularly well positioned to be able to meet that standard.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: What is the bar?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: As you know, the agency has provided guidances. Now the guidances are not highly specific to
individual molecules as has begun to emerge in Europe, where particular classes of molecules or specific things like
EPO, there are more specific guidances. So in Europe, it's a little clearer. In the United States, there are less clear
guidance documents around that, but we're able to have quite detailed discussions with the agency. And our
understanding would be if the results from a single pivotal head-to-head trial were robust enough that that along with
the other package of PK data and so on could be sufficient to reach market. But we're, obviously, early days in all of
this, and we'll have to see what the agency ends up doing when it begins to actually receive these packages for the first
time ever.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Thank you, Michael. Let's go to the next question, Marvin.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Hey, great, thanks for taking our question, so just a question relating to T-VEC. Can you just
remind us a little bit, for the interim analysis on survival, what's the powering and what hazard ratio are you guys
looking for? And was there a futility analysis – I'm sorry, an efficacy potential to stop the study based on an interim, or
are you definitely going to go to the last look? Thank you.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, the study was designed with reasonable power to detect an effect size of 20% in reduction
of risk or greater. And the study was not set up to be stopped based on a success criteria on that. It's important to
recognize that by the time we looked at the interim analysis that we're virtually now or actually, I think, in reality, no
patients still on treatment receiving drug. So at that point, all you're doing is the long-term follow-up to ascertain the
survival events. So there's not much logic to stopping the study at that point. So we will be following through to obtain
what is the primary analysis of overall survival, which we hope will occur by the end of the calendar year.
So that's where we are. This often occurs that the primary analysis of the primary endpoint takes place, and just at that
time one does an interim analysis of secondary endpoint like overall survival. And it can be variably informative
depending on how mature that data is.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, thanks for your question, Yaron. Why don't we go to next question?

<Q - Eun K. Yang>: Thanks very much, a question on biosimilar. I know that you are planning to start a Phase 3 study
for biosimilar Herceptin, the breast cancer treatment for [ph] heart to (25:00) breast cancer treatment apparently is
changing with new drugs like trastuzumab and T-DM1. So do you think there is a rationale to develop biosimilar
Herceptin at this point?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, I do believe that there is an important opportunity for patients around the world to access
biosimilar product, even if it is, if you want to think of it as a first-generation product. I think that Herceptin continues
to be an important product now. And in many marketplaces, I think a biosimilar Herceptin would provide an option for
patients that would be far above and beyond what they would receive otherwise if they were restricted to branded
products. So I see from a societal perspective that these are important products to disseminate to patients.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Obviously, we and our partners, Eun, are focused on that very question and concluded that
we still think there is an attractive opportunity for patients here to have a biosimilar trastuzumab. So thanks for your
question. Let's go to the next question.

Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Just another follow-up question on biosimilars. Can you give us any granularity on that phase,
on that pivotal Herceptin study?

and it's head to head against branded Herceptin. Beyond that, we're not wanting to disclose a lot at this stage.

<A - Sean E. Harper>: We're not providing a readout timeframe for it at this stage.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Actually, Ravi, we wanted with this call to disclose that we're moving that into a pivotal
trial. And as I said in my opening remarks, we'll keep you abreast of the important data flows as they occur for this
portfolio of six molecules as well.

have was actually in-licensed from Synthon, or is that an Amgen product? And I was hoping you could give us
separately just more color on why you think Neulasta units were down and if this is a trend. Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, let's start with the Neulasta question. We said in Tony's remarks we said it was in

Herceptin. So as I say, we'll keep you abreast of the flow of data on that as we have it. Let's go to the next question.

Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Marshall Urist>: Hi, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, so one on XGEVA for me. So I
would just to be curious how you're thinking about that in the U.S. over the balance of the year. And particularly, there
are a lot of moving parts in terms of how Zometa played out, so what your current expectation is for the impact of that
over the rest of the year. Thanks a lot.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: All right, Tony?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So let me respond to that one. So as you know, about six generic Zometas have been
registered to date. We see about four of those have come to market. Their list prices range anywhere between 80% and
55% of the originator's price. What we don't see, of course, is any behind-the-scenes rebates that are happening.
When I look at the business for the first quarter, obviously, very little impact on XGEVA at this stage. In addition,
when we look at the new naïve patients to the brand, that continues to grow, and that's the fact that we'll watch it as
carefully as we can. I think as we go into the next six to twelve months or so, we will see a little bit of disruption in the
marketplace as the generics jostle for some place. We expect it to play out over a 12 to 18-month period, and we will
continue to focus our activities around the clinical value of this brand, the efficacy it brings, and the importance of
putting patients on this brand first.
<Q - Marshall Urist>: Great, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for taking the question, just financial questions, and I promise that
they are related. Jon, could you just give us a sense of what, if any, favorable or positive or negative inventory effect,
what the total accounting variances and the total effect of currency were for the quarter, and then just the balance
between offshore and onshore cash? Thank you.
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yes, let me just – so just repeat those three again, Geoff, cash onshore, offshore cash?
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Inventory, accounting variances...
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yes.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: ...and currency and then cash onshore/offshore.
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yes, okay. So on cash, about $3 billion is onshore, the rest offshore. On inventory –
wholesaler inventory, there was a de minimis shift in the quarter. What Tony referred to on Enbrel was at the pharmacy
level. At the clinic level, we saw some – in retrospect, some build at the end of last year, which played through this
quarter. But at the wholesaler level, we saw de minimis movement overall in the quarter.
And then on accounting adjustments, I think the only one of significance there was on Enbrel, where on returns, we
made an adjustment in the order of $50 million for returns on Enbrel, recognizing that the level of returns we're seeing
was much lower than we had seen previously. That was largely driven by the shift towards mail order pharmacies,
where the return level is lower. So I think that was the only significant accounting adjustment during the quarter. Does
that answer your question?
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: And no currency effect?

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my questions. Jon mentioned expiring royalty burden on Enbrel. I was
hoping he could quantify that and discuss whether that's already part of the $800 million in savings that he's expecting
in 2014.
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yes, so that was a royalty agreement that expired mid-February of this year. It was a 3%
royalty payable to Sanofi which expired. So the profitability of Enbrel will benefit from that going forward, and that
has been reflected in our estimate of the $800 million benefit next year.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Jon, can you also quantify the inventory effects in Q1 on Enbrel?
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Again, there were no wholesale inventory effects, but at the pharmacy level about $50
million.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, a couple of related questions. Tony, were there
any factors that affected the sequential performance in the quarter? You guys mentioned inventories weren't affected,
but a lot of products were lower than what IMS data implied and were lower on a sequential basis.
And then somewhat related for Sean, when you think that T-VEC, you mentioned something about the – you
mentioned the power in the study. But just given the context of current therapies, what do you guys view as a
meaningful OS benefit for this disease or a differentiated OS benefit, I should say? Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Let me start with the question around quarter on quarter. As I look at the IMS data, you're
right. It continues to show good demand both from a new prescription, from a TRx perspective, and that momentum is
continuing from 2012 into 2013. The only difference we can find is a clear level of second-line customer speculation
towards the end of the year prior to our price increases in January that took place. And as we look back retrospectively,
now we see that took place, and that inventory has now worked its way through the channel during the first quarter.
That was the only big thing we've seen as a difference.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. Sean, do you want to take the...
<A - Sean E. Harper>: On the T-VEC question, it's actually a bit of a complex story here because in the case of the
population that we are treating for metastatic melanoma, the durable response rate is viewed by regulators and by
clinicians as being pretty clinically meaningful to these patients because of the number of cutaneous lesions that they
often have, which is quite a bit of disease burden. And the ability to clear these and manage them non-surgically in
responders is in and of itself viewed as clinically meaningful, which is why the primary endpoint was accepted under
Special Protocol Assessment by FDA.
Now obviously, overall survival is very important. And we would expect in multiple studies that we might do in the
future to be able to demonstrate that, and we may well demonstrate it to statistical significance in the existing study. As

you know, we had a trend in that direction. So it's a little hard to quantitate how much overall survival benefit one
would need to have in addition to the DRR effects in this particular clinical setting. I don't think there is a real
benchmark that people have in mind for that.

<Q - Christopher J. Raymond>: Hey, thanks. I do have just one question, more of a financial question actually. So on
the balance sheet, you guys had talked about in the past deleveraging to get at some point to a net cash position, at least
in the near term. And last quarter was, I think as my math says, a net debt increase of about $200 million, so I was just
wondering. When should we start to see this reverse, or is that still a goal?
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yes, Chris, you'll see us in a net cash position by the end of the year. We're generating
on the order of $5 billion-plus of cash a year. I don't anticipate any further debt raises during the course of this year. So
you'll see, as I've said before, I expect to be in a net cash position for the company by the end of this year.

<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great, thanks for taking the question. Sean, you're expecting AMG 386 PFS data in ovarian
cancer midyear. Just to set the table, when are you expecting overall survival data? And what do you think you need to
see in terms of either PFS or OS in order to file for regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe and ultimately to gain
usage in ovarian cancer patients? We realize there's not a ton of novel agents here. I just wanted to get your thinking on
the clinical regulatory path.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, this is a very active question right now. And in fact, ASCO is in the process of trying to
put guidelines out, saying here is a meaningful amount of PFS, here is a meaningful amount of OS by tumor type. And
in some areas, it's pretty easy to do because you've had multiple agents recently approved that have provided six
months of overall survival [indiscernible] (39:05) for example. And you can come up with a six-month target pretty
easily. It's harder to do in a disease like ovarian cancer. And I think for PFS in particular in ovarian cancer, it's quite
difficult. Some people believe that PFS is actually very hard to assess in ovarian cancer, and others think that it's an
important endpoint. Regulatory authorities differ on that.
I do think that the overall survival benefit in this tumor would be quite important. And our program is designed and
powered to be able to assess overall survival with a high degree of power in both the recurrent setting and the first line
accordingly. So again, it's a little bit hard to put your finger on the number of months of additional survival benefit that
would be perceived as being really beneficial. It's hard for me to just come up with a number for that.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Obviously, Matt, we hope to have a chance to talk more about that later in the year, but
let's go to the next question.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, Arvind, how many questions again?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: One at a time.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: At least one.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: I have one question actually. It's a question for Sean, if I may. Hey, Sean, can you give
us an update, if you might, on the cardiac myosin activator? What data has Amgen actually produced for that drug?
Where is it precisely in clinical development? When can investors expect some more disclosure about it, and what are
next steps?
And also I'd be curious. In general, do you view this – what's your level of confidence in this program? I know heart
failure is in general risky, but I'd love to just take your temperature on your thoughts. I realize at the analyst meeting,
you'll have a lot of time to go through this. Thank you.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, thanks, Mark, for the question. Certainly the program, which we call AMG 423, is a very
interesting program from a scientific perspective. It represents one of the only novel mechanistic bases for addressing
systolic heart failure, which is, I am sure you recognize, an epidemic disease that tends to travel with older
demographics.
I think that we're still at an early stage with the program. We have recently completed a third cohort in a Phase 2a
IV-based study that was designed to assess safety of the product versus placebo, as well as some efficacy parameters to
look to see if when we tightly control exposure with the molecule, we can actually determine that there is a therapeutic
window for the mechanism. Beyond that, we've started now into an oral dosing study to see if we can achieve in heart
failure patients a well-behaved oral formulation, PK exposure profile because, again, therapeutic window is going to be
key here.
So it's early. This is a difficult area. I would characterize this as on the spectrum of what we're doing on the
high-risk/high-reward quadrant. But I think the opportunity to benefit very large numbers of patients with a very

stage of development.

Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Hi, thanks. I have a question on T-VEC. So I'm wondering if you feel like you need to show a
statistically significant OS benefit in order to file, and if not, why not file earlier than the end of the year.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, thanks. Sean?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, I think that it's a great question. We are working with regulators right now to review the
current data set and work with them around the filing strategy, and we'll sort that out. We do expect to have the survival
data by the end of the year, so the timeframes are going to line up to some extent independent. The exact filing strategy
is immaterial. But I would say that we again do believe that the durable response is a clinically meaningful benefit to
this particular patient population who are burdened with a lot of cutaneous disease. And obviously, a very strong
survival trend or a statistically significant survival result is even better. So we're looking at this as being an important
result already, based on what we've seen. We hope it gets better as we look at the full survival result, but that will
emerge as we have that event-driven result come to us.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, Marvin, let's go to the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. T-VEC I think is one of the products you previously characterized as
high-risk/high-reward. Given that you already hit the primary endpoint, do you still think that this is a high risk – or
hitting survival is a high risk?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: I'd now say that we have a level of proof-of-concept for the mechanism that was hard to
embrace completely when one was looking at a relatively small Phase 2 data set, although that Phase 2 data set did
drive us to buy bio-vaccine to pursue the investment involved in completing this Phase 3 trial. One Phase 3 result is
obviously much more compelling, and I would really no longer view this from a platform technology perspective as
high risk.
Whether or not we hit overall survival statistical significance in this analysis is always hard to call. Part of that is the
size of the study and part power that you have and so on. Also recall that this study was never designed with the
primary objective of assessing overall survival. And so it's important to recognize that there is a lot more work to do
with T-VEC. And, in particular, combining T-VEC with other immunotherapies going forward both in melanoma and
in other tumor types is now something I view as extremely exciting from a scientific clinical perspective.
Robert A. Bradway
All right, we're following up, Howard, on your question, I hope you all saw Arvind's note about the investor conference
that we'll be hosting at ASCO, and we'll have more opportunity to talk to you there about T-VEC and the data that
