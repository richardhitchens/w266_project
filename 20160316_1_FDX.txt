Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. We appreciate everyone on the call participating in it.
Let me begin by thanking hundreds of thousands of FedEx teammates for delivering our Purple Promise every day,
including a great 2015 peak season.
FedEx Corporation continues to improve margins, financial performance, and competitive position. As noted, our 3Q
FY year over year earnings per share is up 23%. I should note there are three recurring areas of concern, however,
expressed in various articles and reports: one, future margins; two, industry disruption; and three, capital spending.
Regarding margins, the Express profit improvement program will be exceeded by May 31. Express segment margins in
the current fourth fiscal quarter will be approximately 12%. Likewise, FedEx Ground, including SmartPost margins,
will increase and be 16%-plus this quarter, while the FedEx Ground and SupplyChain segment will be 15%.
Remember, GENCO is now part of this segment, and the margins in this business will not be as high as those of
Ground itself. However, the strategic importance of our expanded customer solutions resulting from the GENCO
acquisition is profound and will greatly benefit our future financial performance.
A significant issue for FedEx Ground over the past year has been the extraordinary growth of oversized shipments,
which Mike Glenn and Henry Maier will address. It is truly unfortunate that Congress did not increase the federal
twin-trailer limit from 28 feet each to 33 feet, which would have benefited consumers, lowered fuel consumption, and
reduced highway accidents.
We're optimistic about FedEx Freight improving margins in the future as well, and Mike Ducker can talk about that.
It's important to note that we manage FedEx operating companies to maximize the corporation's performance over the
long term. So in any given quarter, we may spend more in one segment to achieve this result.
The concerns about industry disruption continue to be fueled by fantastical, and let me emphasize, I chose this word
carefully, articles and reports which are devoid of in-depth knowledge of logistics systems and the markets which
FedEx serves. As we have previously noted, network design, technology, facilities capabilities, and route/stop densities
are the key elements in the FedEx, UPS, and Postal Service systems that make it highly likely these entities will remain
the primary carriers for e-commerce shipments in the U.S. for the foreseeable future.
Finally, FedEx is currently investing in FedEx Express fleet modernization and expansion of FedEx Ground's highly
automated facilities. Both these major programs have high returns and are integral to margin expansion. Our cash flows
are such that we can easily fund investments at $4 billion to $5 billion per year while retiring debt used to acquire TNT

if the transaction is approved and stock repurchases. Of course, we include replacement CapEx in this projection.
To reiterate, we believe FedEx will continue to improve margins, EPS, capital returns, and increase cash flows, which
we have told you repeatedly over the last couple of years and again have demonstrated this quarter.
Let me now turn to Mike Glenn for our economic outlook, followed by Alan Graf with detailed remarks about our
financials. Mike?
T. Michael Glenn
Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business
conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume, and yield, and provide some commentary on broader industry
trends that we are experiencing.
On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 2.2% for calendar
2016, 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter; and 2.5% for calendar 2017, led by gains in consumer
spending. We expect industrial production growth of 0.6% in calendar 2016, 130 basis points lower than last quarter;
and 2.5% for next year. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.5% for calendar 2016, which is 30 basis points below last
quarter, and 2.9% for calendar 2017.
Now I'll review revenue, volume, and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, revenue decreased 1%, as lower
fuel surcharge and unfavorable currency exchange rates more than offset yield growth. U.S. domestic package volume
grew by 2%, driven by growth in Overnight packages. U.S. domestic revenue per package increased 1% despite lower
fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year domestic Express package yields grew 3%, primarily due
to rate and discounts.
FedEx International Economy volume grew 2%, while FedEx International Priority volume decreased 3%.
International export revenue per package decreased 5%, as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange
rates negatively impacted yields. Excluding fuel, International export Express package yield decreased 1%, primarily
driven by the negative impact of exchange rates, which outweighed the positive impact of rate and discount changes.
FedEx Ground revenue increased 30% in the quarter, driven by higher Ground volume and yield, the recording of
SmartPost revenue on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment and due to the inclusion of GENCO results.
FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 11% in Q3, primarily driven by growth for demand for residential deliveries
related to e-commerce. FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 8% year over year in Q3 due to the recording of
SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the
impact of fuel, Ground yield per package including SmartPost increased 11% year over year, driven primarily by rate
and discount and SmartPost customer mix.
FedEx Freight increased revenue 1% as LTL shipments increased 7% and revenue per shipment declined 4%. The
increase in shipments is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability,
and choice of priority and economy services for our LTL customers. Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower
fuel surcharges and average weight per shipment. Excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per
shipment was down 1% year over year due to lower weight per shipment.
Now I'll discuss in more detail some of the industry dynamics that drove the record peak season and beyond. The 2015
peak season was historic by many measures and it was driven by the continued growth of e-commerce. Demand for
residential deliveries across the industry surpassed expectations as consumers increased online shopping in record
numbers. Not only was there higher volumes, but the types of goods purchased online increased.
FedEx experienced record demand including multiple days of greater than 25 million packages delivered, which is
more than double our average daily volume. We're proud of our team members and the incredible job they did with
more than 325 million packages delivered during the peak period. We worked very closely with our large e-tail and
other peak customers to prepare for their needs and to deliver the holidays.

It is very clear that e-commerce has now enabled a full-scale retail revolution. There are several important trends worth
noting. First, referring to a specific peak day is quickly becoming a thing of the past. As evidenced this year, there were
multiple days where volumes exceeded 25 million packages, as consumer buying habits are changing. We view this as
a positive, as Mother Nature can sometimes play havoc with last-minute e-commerce shoppers. Smoothing sales
throughout peak season is a trend that will benefit retailers and transportation companies alike. We believe online
shoppers will have increasing incentives to order earlier in the holiday season.
Second, more and more retailers are fulfilling e-commerce orders from individual stores or, what we call,
store-to-home delivery. FedEx is well-positioned to service this growing market in the years ahead with our broad
portfolio of services, including metro delivery and SameDay services.
Third, we're seeing a significant increase in non-traditional items now being purchased online; mattresses, canoes,
swing sets, and big-screen TVs, just to name a few. We welcome this opportunity, but it is important that we price
these items accordingly to account for the operational complexities such as manual sortation, two-person delivery, et
cetera.
As a result, we'll be adjusting the additional handling surcharge for FedEx Ground. Today, if a package length is
greater than 60 inches, the additional handling surcharge will be applied. Beginning June 1, the maximum length will
be reduced from 60 inches to 48 inches. We believe 48 inches is appropriate as it is the standard length of an LTL
pallet.
It's important to remember that the primary value proposition of e-commerce is the ability to order a product online and
have it reliably delivered to the consumer. In that regard, FedEx is and will continue to be a key enabler for
e-commerce in the years ahead. By our estimates, more than 95% of all e-commerce orders today are delivered by one
of three entities in the United States: FedEx, the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic
relationship to transport their Priority Mail, and UPS. In fact, if we were to isolate our e-commerce business, one could
argue that FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today.
I'd also like to clarify some of the public discussion and speculation concerning Amazon adding some direct
transportation capabilities. First, Amazon is a valuable customer that we've worked with for many years and we expect
to work with them for many years to come. We have been in constant dialogue with them to understand their
transportation needs as they have experienced significant growth. We have been aware of Amazon's need for
supplemental capacity related to inventory management, which is driving some of the investments they're making in
transportation.
Large retailers have long had their own transportation capabilities, primarily to enable movement and positioning of
inventory across their store and fulfillment locations. While recent stories and reports of a new entity competing with
the three major carriers in the United States grabs headlines, the reality is it would be a daunting task requiring tens of
billions of dollars in capital in years to build sufficient scale and density to replicate existing networks like FedEx. It's
also important to note that no one FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue.
Additionally, other than the Postal Service, no single customer represents more than approximately 3% of revenue for
FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, or FedEx Freight. We manage these relationships carefully to ensure we don't become
overly-dependent on any one customer. We expect these industry trends and dynamics to accelerate this coming
holiday season, and we will continue to affect the industry year-round. FedEx is well-positioned to provide innovative
solutions and to meet this growing demand.
And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Graf.
Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike, for that excellent report, and good afternoon, everyone.

We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $2.51 per diluted share, up year over year more than 23%. Adjusted
consolidated operating margin increased to a healthy 9.2% versus 8.3% last year. These record earnings proved once
again the success of our strategy to manage our portfolio of services to achieve enterprise results and it's important to
remember this strategy does not always translate into each segment's individual earnings and margin performance. We
expect our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings to be up 20% to 22% over last year as we continue to benefit from our
execution of the profit improvement program at Express. Our positive financial momentum should continue into our
upcoming fiscal 2017 where we expect continued solid growth in earnings and cash flow.
This quarter, there were three expense adjustments within corporate, eliminations, and other. First, during the quarter,
we reached agreements in principle to settle all of the 19 cases on appeal in the multi-district independent contractor
litigation. The settlements will require court approval. We recognize a liability for the net expected loss related to these
cases and certain other pending independent contractor related proceedings of $204 million or $0.46 per diluted share.
These disputes involve a contractor model which FedEx Ground has not operated since 2011.
This is good news because assuming the necessary court approvals are obtained, it resolves all of the remaining
multi-district litigation cases. We are defending contractor model cases that are no longer – that are not or are no longer
part of the multi-district litigation. These cases are in varying stages of litigation. We do not expect to incur a material
loss in these cases.
Secondly, net expenses related to the settlement of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection matter involving FedEx
Trade Networks were $69 million or $0.15 per diluted share. And thirdly, our pending acquisition of TNT Express and
operating income impact of $23 million and EPS impact of $0.06 per diluted share.
Turning to the segments and starting with our star, Express. Express had an outstanding quarter, as operating income
climbed 51% and operating margin increased despite lower revenues. Let me repeat that. Operating income climbed
51% and operating margin increased despite lower revenues. Who does that? Express operating margin was 9.1%, up
320 basis points versus last year and is the best third quarter margin in Express segment history. The increase was
driven primarily by yield management, U.S. domestic volume growth and ongoing benefits from the profit
improvement program. Express is efficiently managing volume increases in e-commerce and, at the same time,
continued softness in international volumes. The profit improvement program that we announced in 2012 continues to
improve revenue quality, increase productivity, and constrain expenses.
Turning to Ground, Ground saw unprecedented demand, with volumes increasing 11%. However, Ground's operating
margin declined. The 390 basis point decline in operating margin was primarily driven by five factors: one, 190 basis
points from the change in SmartPost revenue reporting and the inclusion of GENCO results; two, 60 basis points from
higher costs, driven significantly by peak season demand that exceeded both volume and package size expectations, as
Mike discussed; third, 60 basis points from higher self-insurance reserves; fourth, 30 basis points from increased
purchased transportation rates for line-haul; and fifth, 30 basis points from network expansion costs.
As Mike said, we are evaluating several Ground pricing initiatives to balance our revenue and costs and increase
margins. In addition, over the next two years, we are spending additional capital at Ground to expand needed capacity
to support both commercial and e-commerce growth, including non-conveyable annexes designed to more efficiently
handle those packages that do not fit on our sortation equipment. As Fred mentioned, we expect Ground to return to
mid-teens margins in the fourth quarter.
At Freight, Freight continues to adjust to a very challenging LTL market. Freight's segment operating results decreased
primarily due to salaries and employee benefits expense outpacing revenue growth. And revenue growth was
negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharges and weight per shipment.
We have been installing dimensional scanners to more accurately cost and price shipments. Freight currently has 45
dimensional scanners in operation today, with another eight slated to be installed by the end of the fiscal year. These
dimensional scanners pay for themselves in less than a year and are an important part of our yield improvement
program. We also expect Freight's productivity to continue to improve in Q4 as well as throughout 2017.

From an outlook standpoint, we expect our solid earnings growth to continue in the fourth quarter from the execution of
the profit improvement program and from improvements in our Express and Ground segments due to volume and yield
growth. We are updating the lower part of the range for our adjusted FY 2016 earnings guidance to $10.70 before
year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. The new range of $10.70 to $10.90 represents adjusted EPS
growth of 20% to 22% year over year.
Our outlook excludes certain legal costs as well as any TNT integration costs or results. Our expectations for earnings
are dependent on several external factors, including fuel prices and moderate growth in the global economy.
The capital spending forecast for the fiscal year is now $4.8 billion, which is higher than our previous forecast due to
increased investments in FedEx Ground as we continue to expand the network in anticipation of continued high growth.
FedEx is strongly committed to delivering long-term value for our customers, shareowners, and team members. In
January, we completed a $15 million share repurchase program authorized in September 2014 and announced our most
recent stock repurchase program of up to 25 million shares of FedEx Corporation common stock. Since FY 2014,
FedEx has returned over $8.3 billion to shareowners through the repurchase of over 60 million shares and during the
past two years, has increased its dividend by 33% and 25% respectively. Our strong balance sheet, profit, and cash flow
performance give us the flexibility to initiate this stock repurchase program while continuing to execute our strategic
growth initiatives.
In the near term, we are planning a debt offering, the proceeds of which are expected to be used for general corporate
purposes, including share repurchases and the prepayment of certain tax-exempt debt. We intend to fund the acquisition
of TNT Express with cash from operations and proceeds from a planned debt offering in the fourth quarter, which we
plan to launch shortly after the other debt offering. We will evaluate assessing the euro market for the TNT funding.
The lowered Moody's rating that we expected will have a de minimis impact on our upcoming financings.
Regarding the TNT acquisition, we completed several steps during the third quarter, including unconditional approval
by the European Commission of our intention to acquire TNT and TNT's announced agreement to sell its airline
operation to comply with rules governing foreign ownership of European airlines. We had many questions submitted
by analysts on the TNT acquisition, many of which we cannot answer in detail at this time. I will say that FY 2017 will
be a year of investment and integration. And then beginning in fiscal 2018, I am expecting TNT to be very accretive to
earnings.
The TNT acquisition is expected to expand our global portfolio, particularly in Europe, significantly lower our costs to
serve our European markets by increasing density in our pickup and delivery operations, and accelerate our global
growth. More than 20 FedEx and TNT operational and geographical teams are planning to make the transition as
smooth as possible for customers and team members to position FedEx for long-term profitable growth. We remain
confident that we will close the acquisition in the first half of calendar year 2016, and we were very pleased with TNT's
recently reported improving operating performance.
When approved, this landmark acquisition is expected to bring over 50,000 new team members to our ranks and
significantly improve our global competitive position.
In closing, I am extremely proud of the FedEx team for its impressive efforts. Our financial momentum should continue
into FY 2017, where we expect continued solid growth in earnings and cash flow.
Thank you for your attention, and I'm now going to turn the meeting back over to Fred who will start the Q&A.
Frederick Wallace Smith
Mickey, why don't we take – we covered most of the Internet answers in my remarks, Mike's remarks, and Alan's
remarks. There are a couple others we'll get to, but I'll let Mickey moderate at this point in time for the other ones. And
I'd point out we'll plan to spend about 45 minutes on the Q&A or until we run out of strategic questions. We're not
going to replow a lot of ground that we have done in the past year because it just wastes everybody's time.

Okay, the first question? We're ready for the first live question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. FedEx would like to invite questions via e-mail. To e-mail your question, please use the ir@fedex.com
e-mail address and provide your name and contact information. [Operator Instructions] We'll move first to Chris
Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to think about a bigger picture strategic question for
the Express side of the business. So far, the profit improvement plan has been very successful and you're hitting your
goals. As you think about the next three years, excluding TNT for a moment, how do you think about the capital
intensity and the asset intensity of that business? Does there come a point where there's an opportunity to maybe do
more business with fewer assets in the air and leveraging the supply dynamics within the air cargo market? I wanted to
think about the bigger picture trend for Express going forward. Can you feel more confident using third-party aircraft
and how should we be thinking about that?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks for your question, Chris, and thanks for your comments about our Express team.
They've done a great job. The answer to your question is we have a great fleet modernization plan that actually takes us
out a lot of years. And we continue to replace the old planes with the new 767s and the 777s. And quite frankly, we've
actually already been doing things like you suggested, using third-party lift where appropriate around the world, and
that's been very beneficial and very profitable obviously.
But I think on top of that, our FTN, our FedEx Trade Networks organization and their strategic part of our business
around the world on ocean shipping with the air freight shipping and obviously the Priority Express shipping, you can
see that we will continue to grow our profits and our margins for a long, long time. And quite frankly, we've got our
network right in the sweet zone right now, executing on all cylinders.
So I think to answer your question, we probably could look at opportunities to add more into our capacity if we needed
to. The great thing about what we've done is we can flex up or down, and we've appropriately done that. So we're
always looking for opportunities to grow our profits and grow our margins. And if that appears to be the case, we'll go
forward with that.
Operator
And we'll move to our next question from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Thanks, good afternoon. Following up on your comments regarding capital spending,
looking out a couple of years to fiscal 2017 and 2018, how should we think about growth in CapEx at Ground versus
Express exclusive of any impact from TNT?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Allison, this is Alan. You need to think about CapEx exclusive of TNT being at $5 billion or a
little bit over for the next couple of years, and most of that increase is going into the Ground networks. We have about
100 projects underway right now that we hope to get finished before next peak. A broad brush across the country, two
new hubs, all these things are going to be automated, and I'm sure Henry can add a little bit to that, but easily
affordable. The actual number will be higher because we're going to have to invest in TNT. TNT had been
under-invested in, and we'll have more to tell you about that after we close. Henry?

<A - Henry J. Maier>: Allison, we have on tap for this year two hubs and 19 automated satellites, which will bring us
up to over 100. I think the exact number is 103 automated facilities out of a network of about 550 by the end of the
year. And that's what's driving the majority of our capital spend.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Good afternoon. Thank you for the question, and I appreciate all the comments at the
beginning, Fred. It's helpful to get that perspective. On the Express, your various comments are pretty upbeat about
how you're ending the year with Express margin. And I think you said like 12% in fourth quarter. Would you
reconsider kind of what you might be able to get to in Express margin over the next several years? And is there any
kind of framework for what might be a path forward? You've talked about 10% in the past. Is this something that we
ought to think about 11% or 12% on a full year basis, or? Just wondering if you could frame that kind of additional
momentum and how we might think about that the next few years in Express. Thank you.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Tom, and I appreciate your feedback. And I remember you were there when we
announced our profit improvement plan and I'm really pleased to say that we're hitting it and exceeding it. And the
momentum actually is carrying us into the fourth quarter and it will carry us into the next fiscal year. And it's in every
area. Quite frankly, we have a DNA now in our company. We've right-sized the company. We've got the right cost
structure in place for our people and our airplanes and our whole network around the world. TNT, as Alan mentioned
before and Fred, is going to be fantastic going forward.
But I think the answer will be obvious. The answer is, we continue to grow our profits and our margins. And so you can
see it in the fourth quarter we're at 12%. Obviously, double-digit margins are right on us now and we continue to grow
into that going forward. So without being too much more specific than we already are, which we've been more specific
than we usually are, yeah, you can see very strong double-digit margins at Express going forward.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith again. Let me reiterate what I said at the opening of my remarks
and the end of the remarks. We anticipate FedEx Corporation's margins, returns, cash flows, and EPS to increase over
the foreseeable future. So, obviously, with Express and then Ground as our biggest operating companies, that should
basically answer your question.
Regarding the item on the fleet, I think it's important to note that FedEx Express is operating 20 less airplanes today in
2016 than we were in 2013. Now part of the reason we're able to do that is because the airplanes are much more
reliable. We don't need as many as spares. There's not as many in maintenance intervals. And, of course, we're always
trying to make our assets sweat more and use assets productively, whether they're ours or someone else's. So that's an
integral part of what we do as well.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question will come from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.
<Q - Kelly Dougherty>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to maybe turn to Ground a little bit and
any better sense you can provide about the profitability improvement potential that could come from the SmartPost
integration, maybe how long of a process this will take, if it's something that will start to see no noticeable difference in
fiscal 2017. I know that the goal is mid-teens gross margins, and you talked about that for the next quarter, but kind of
from a full year basis, just wondering if you can walk us through how and when we get there.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Hi, Kelly. This is Henry Maier. Thanks for the question. I think it's important to point out here
that we are totally focused at FedEx Ground on long-term profitable growth. We have a number of initiatives underway
right now that, over the long-term, will fundamentally change the way we operate FedEx Ground. So let me share a

couple of them with you. There are network changes underway that integrate commercial and residential networks and
position us to increase our operating days and continue to enhance our service. We are making a number of operating
adjustments that enable the cost effective and productive handling of the increased volume of large, non-conveyable
packages.
We're also investing in technology that supports operating one consolidated Ground network, which prior to our
announcement last September, we had two. We're also transitioning our U.S. pickup and delivery service providers
national to a single operating agreement that enables increased service capacity and improves operational flexibility for
these independent businesses. Now these investments, which vary in timetables but should be essentially complete by
the end of by – I'm sorry – prior to FY 2021, we'll have a short-term impact on margin but we'll ultimately drive costs
out of the network enabling Ground margins to return to historic levels. And we continue to believe that we are
uniquely positioned to succeed in this new e-commerce world.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from David Ross with Stifel.
<Q - David Ross>: Yes. Good afternoon. Just wanted to turn to FedEx Freight for a second. Shipment growth
accelerated nicely, up 7% in a challenging period for the LTL industry, but margins weakened. Just wanted to get a
little bit more color, Mike, in terms of what's behind that, in terms of how much was related to fuel. Was it an
intentional move to not push the price lever as much to get the volume in, or what else is going on there?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Thanks for the question. This is Mike Glenn. The success that we had in growth was
primarily driven by our sales activities in the small and mid-size customer segment. Our sales team is executing crisply
and bringing the kind of growth that we're looking for. The primary driver, absent fuel, and the lower yield per
shipment or revenue per shipment was lower weight per shipment. So I'll turn it over to Mike Ducker to comment
further.
<A - Michael L. Ducker>: Yes, David. Mike Ducker. And I'll just reiterate the excellent job done. Most of that growth
came in the small and medium sector. In the first half of 2016, we had anticipated volume growth that really didn't
materialize, so we found ourselves overstaffed in certain geographies and through a combination of that sales success
Mike just talked about and reduced staffing through attrition, we've now better aligned our staffing to volume levels.
We're in balance and we've got significantly improved network efficiencies going forward.
So a lot of that was input costs on salaries and wages and benefits versus the volume that we had at first part of the
year. So now we're operating in balance. Service levels are the best in many years. We're focused on yield
improvement, productivity improvement, and better capacity management in the future.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So Fred Smith here. I mentioned that we covered most of the Internet questions in
the prepared remarks. There were a couple that didn't fit, one of them from Nate Brochmann of William Blair. We all
likely agree that same-day delivery is a relatively small market today and likely will be even in the future. What is
FedEx doing to prepare and partner with local delivery/final-mile firms if the market turns out to be larger than
expected? Mike?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Nate, FedEx currently offers same-day delivery in 23 markets and we've seen volume
growth in key segments such as retail, e-commerce, healthcare, and others. FedEx SameDay City plays an important
role in our e-commerce suite of services and customers are responding well to the uniformed professionalism of our
business model. Having said that, it still represents a niche offering and a very small percentage of our overall portfolio,
but we are able to scale when demand dictates.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Nate also asked a question about FedEx Ground and the productivity of our
independent service providers. I think Henry answered that in just a moment ago, so we'll move on to one by David
Ross of Stifel. China has been grabbing a lot of headlines in recent months. Please discuss the importance of China's
economy to the FedEx global Express network. Dave Bronczek?

<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Fred, and thanks for the question, David. Obviously, China is very important to us,
but they're not more important than all the rest of the world. And they're a part of the rest of the world for us. There's a
lot of multi-national companies that are in China that we do business with in China and exporting out of China. So I
would say that we're always watching how the economy is in China, but it's not causing us any problem or any concern
right now because our customers there are, for the most part, multi-national customers.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: There was also a question from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley about Amazon's
building out some of its own capacity. I think that was answered in its entirety by Mike's remark. Tell me, queue
yourself up, Ravi, if that's not the case. Now we'll take another question from someone on the line.
Operator
Okay. And our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Hey. Sorry about that. So thanks, Fred and team, for a great, great job on the quarter.
But, maybe you could talk a little bit, Alan, on TNT. I know you want to wait till it closes, but can you talk about the
process here? Does the appeal slow the potential on closing? Is there a timing we should expect on the China decision?
And then maybe you can talk about in terms of synergies when we can kind of expect to see the level and amount as
you talked about what's going to go into 2018 and the benefits you get from that?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith. Let me ask our General Counsel, Christine Richards, to comment
on the first. And regarding the second, since it has not been approved, I think, unfortunately, we need to wait on
making any comments about that until the transaction has closed, but we'll make sure we do that assuming that it does
close in the first call after that. So, Chris, if you'll speak to the legal issues.
<A - Christine P. Richards>: Yes. Ken, this is Chris Richards. Thank you for the question. I'm very pleased to report
that we have obtained a tremendous number of competitive approvals from the last call and, at this point in time, we
have unconditional approval in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the European Union, Israel, Japan, Namibia, New
Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, the Ukraine, the United States, and Vietnam. We are
completing the process and have review pending in Argentina, China, and Korea. We also have an appeal of the
unconditional approval in Brazil, which was an expected appeal. It is a part of their normal process and we are very
confident that we will close the acquisition of TNT in the first half of calendar year 2016 with all necessary regulatory
approvals.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: We'll take live questions again.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll move next to Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. With regards to the omni-channel retailing, I'm curious which
network that's running through when you're getting from the store to home, I would imagine anything that's going
intra-store is running across the B2B network, probably predominantly in Express. But was hoping to get a little bit of
perspective related to which respective network it runs through and the impact to return on invested capital and revenue
per unit would be really helpful.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. Regarding our metro service capabilities, we have a variety of services.
We have Express service for the premium packages that require a specific delivery time. We have Ground services that
can serve metro areas. We also have SmartPost services that can serve metro. So we have a variety of services to meet
that need. I should also mention SameDay City, which is operated by our FedEx Office team, also has the capability to
serve metro store-to-home delivery. So we have a wide variety of service capabilities and we're well-suited to
participate in that market segment.

<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith speaking. Let me again remind the people that follow FedEx that
our services are a portfolio which are broadly used by customers. I think I'm correct; well into the 90% of our
customers, Mike, use Express and Ground. Over 70% use Express, Ground, and Freight. And I think based on the
e-mails and the comments that I get on the Internet, every man, woman, and child in America uses FedEx Office.
So again, our job is to try to improve earnings, returns, cash flows, and we have told you that we are confident that we
can do that. And I think a little bit on this call, not so much as in the past, if you attempt to try to dissect FedEx into a
sum of the parts analysis, you're going to get surprised. We buy airplanes because they increase earnings, cash flows,
and returns over a period of time. We add automated ground facilities because they do the same thing.
So there's no motivation inside FedEx to do anything other than to achieve those results at the corporate level. And
sometimes we decide to be aggressive in one segment because we're achieving our corporate goals, and you've seen
that with the Ground numbers when we were responding to the post-2008 crash in Express and fuel prices running up
to $147 a barrel. So we launched the profit improvement program, and a lot of the corporate results were funded by the
outstanding performance of Ground.
Now we're doing a lot of things over on Henry's side of the house. And as Express margins and returns are expanding,
we're able to do that, still buying a lot of stock and pay for a significant acquisition. So it's important to keep that in
mind when you're asking these questions.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Ravi Shanker>: Thanks. Good evening, everyone. Fred, thanks for addressing my e-mail question on Amazon,
just one follow-up on omni-channel. Can you give us an update on your Monday residential service trial? How many
cities so far or have you expanded it to any new cities, and what have you learned from the trial so far?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Thanks, Ravi. It's I guess safe to say that the six-day pilot we ran in Tennessee this year was an
unmitigated success. We have plans to expand it later this summer, and we're looking very hard at whether or not we
just run this network six days a week year-round. We get much more turns out of the assets. I think Dave mentioned
making the assets sweat. We certainly do that.
I think the other thing that's important for people on the call to understand is that while we talk a lot about peak,
e-commerce buying behavior is really shifting to a peak-like look year-round. We're extremely heavy on Monday
because of the e-commerce orders that flow in and are fulfilled over the weekend. And I think long term, I think a
six-day a week operation is probably the best operation to run because these e-commerce stores never shut down. So I
think we're well-positioned there.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So, Alan, I wanted to just follow up a little bit on the
guidance. So if I plug 12% Express margins for the fourth quarter into the model, it feels like there's some upside
potential to that $10.70 to $10.90 range. So any offsets that we should be thinking about to keep us within that range?
And I know you made some preliminary comments on fiscal 2017. But can give any more color on what you consider
solid earnings growth, if you think we could be in that 10% to 15% long-term guidance that you have?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: The guidance is the best that I can do. I missed so many quarters that now we're back to a
quarterly guidance during the fourth quarter. You never know. Fuel prices are ticking up a little bit, and so that could
possibly work against us on a year-over-year basis, so we're watching that very carefully. There could be – what
happens at the end of the year with aircraft maintenance, we think there might be a little bit of risk with that as well. So

we're watching all these very carefully. But I'm pretty confident in that range and that's why we cut the bottom of it off.
And Mike told you about how we've lowered substantially our expectations for the economy in 2016, and so we're
keeping our eye on that as well. But having said that, I'm not guaranteeing we're going to hit inside that range because
my track record has not been very good on a quarterly basis.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Fred Smith here. We have one Internet question from Jeffrey Kauffman, The
Buckingham Research Group, on the TPP, Trans-Pacific trade agreement. While the agreement reached seemed a
reason to celebrate, it seems that popular politics seems to be voting down free trade in this election season. What does
TPP mean to FedEx, and does management view the risk of TPP not being approved increasing? And can you please
provide an update?
I don't think there's any question about the fact that TPP is going to be harder to pass given that the leading Republican
and Democratic candidates for President of the United States are against it. Free trade and opening markets has been
American policy since 1934 when Roosevelt and Hull passed the Trade Agreement Act that overturned the absolutely
disastrous Smoot-Hawley tariffs. Those were two Republicans that in 1929 or 1930 put in a lot of tariffs to protect
America. So trade contracted by 66%. And the Roosevelt-Hull action in 1934 turned it around, but there is no question
that those tariffs created, was a big part of the cause of the Depression.
So after the war, one of the first things that Hull still there and Roosevelt before his death worked on was the
International Trade Organization, and along with the IMF and the World Bank. They couldn't get it passed, so they
instead came up with this framework called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's called GATT. And seven
times they expanded trade until the World Trade Organization was put in place back in the 1990s.
So the thought that trade had not been a great thing for the world and America is absolutely belied by facts. Now have
there been mercantilists? Of course there have. Japan and China in particular. But to lump in all trade with the trade
practices of a couple of trading partners is like putting leeches on you and bleeding you the way they used to do during
the old days and think you're going to get better. I mean, it's a self-inflicted problem. And in the case of Mexico, the
NAFTA agreement has added hundreds of billions of dollars to U.S. business, which is traded with Mexico. Yes, we do
have a modest trade deficit with Mexico, but the benefits of trade are always dispersed. Lower iPhones, lower TVs,
lower priced t-shirts, lower automobile costs, on and on down the line, which makes everyone's standard of living
better. Whereas the pain is always localized, like the unfortunate Carrier Air Conditioner shut down in Indiana that's
being so prominently talked about.
Now TPP, it should be noticed – and everybody makes a big thing out of the fact that it's a 54,000-page document or
something like that – what it does in the main is to reduce 18,000 tariffs on U.S. goods. So it helps us a lot, and I hope
as we get into the general election, the profound benefits of free trade over many, many decades can be understood and
the mercantilist practices of people who are not comporting to the WTO dealt with on an individual basis. So we think
that it's much more difficult to get TPP passed, but I can promise you, we're going to work as hard as we can to make
sure people understand these issues.
Okay. We'll take another question from someone live on the call.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll move to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Good evening, everyone, and thanks for taking my question, and again, congrats on the
growth. It's tough to come by here for most other companies. So Fred or Mike, can you, guys, help us understand here,
because this might be part of the confusion or part of the problem looking at Amazon. As we have more and more
omni-channel distribution as Amazon puts fulfillment centers closer to the consumer, has there been a length of haul
reduction in the average e-commerce shipment, or is it by far still regional distribution model? And so if we do go to
more local type distribution, how does that change where you see the capital priorities for FedEx? Or maybe it's not
even shifting that way?

<A - T. Michael Glenn>: I think Amazon's strategy is clear. The more distributions facilities they put up, the more
they would like to be close to the end consumer, which by definition makes more deliveries on a local basis. Having
said that, all the conversation about new entrants into the local delivery market, I mean, there are hundreds and
thousands of local delivery companies in every market in the country delivering parcels. All you have to do is Google a
local delivery and you'll come – I'm not sure where you live, but Google that and the city where you live and you'll find
hundreds of companies that deliver parcels on a local basis every day. That's not the market that FedEx competes in on
a day-to-day basis. We run a broad global network.
Now, having said that, as I mentioned before, no single customer represents over 3% of our total revenue. So we're not
exposed to any one customer and we try to manage our business so that we don't get overexposed in that regard. So
we're well positioned for growth long-term. And as I said, Amazon is a good customer. We expect them to be a good
customer long-term.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Fred Smith here. Let me refer you to my friend, David Abney's, remarks after their
last quarterly results. He was on CNBC, did a great job, and he pointed out that the essential thing in the delivery
business is route density and revenue per delivery stop. And that is why he said virtually the same thing that we have
said, that in all likelihood the primary deliverers of e-commerce shipments for the foreseeable future will be UPS, the
U.S. Postal Service, and FedEx. Because input costs, even though you might have a local operator or the thousands that
Mike talked about are trumped by the delivery density and the revenue per stop characteristics of the big carriers.
And remember, we're not delivering from 50 fulfillment centers or 100 stores or 60 stores, we have the capability to
pickup, transport, and deliver an item from 95% of the human beings on the planet, much less every business in the
world, within one to two business days, door-to-door, customs cleared. So that's known as Metcalfe's Law. Everybody
understands this in the telecommunications business. It's the number of nodes on the networks squared. If you run a hub
and spoke system, it's N times N minus one. So whether you're a big box retailer or you're an e-tailer that puts their
fulfillment centers, which is a surrogate for the store and delivers the items individually or have you come into the
store, the economics are the same. It's network density and revenue per delivery stop that are the determinate of who's
going to deliver these packages in the years to come.
The Postal Service delivers to 154 million addresses every day. And so, lightweight e-commerce packages are perfect
for the Postal Service because they can put them in with the mail and deliver them to residences. That's why Parcel
Select, as they call it, is partnered with FedEx SmartPost, UPS SurePost, Amazon Direct Injection, and another group
of smaller competitors in this so-called consolidator space. And it's that misunderstanding that the drivers are network
density and revenue per delivery stop that have led to a lot of the misunderstanding about the future evolution of the
markets. Okay, another question from a live question?
Operator
Yes. We'll move to Matt Troy with Nomura.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Yes, thanks. So I was wanting to look at the Express segment, the rate of growth in the Overnight
premium product almost doubled versus your year-to-date rate. Was just curious, is that more tied to the urgency
around peak season, or are you seeing a shift back in behavior by consumers that's more sustainable to the premium
product?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: We had strong demand for Overnight services in peak season. Obviously, that is certainly
the case as you get closer to Christmas day and that was a key driver for that.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Let me take a couple of Internet questions here, and then Mickey can tie it off with
one or two questions from live questions. John Barnes asked about DIM pricing. I think we've pretty well covered that.

<A - T. Michael Glenn>: John, let me just say that FedEx implemented DIM pricing last January, therefore, the third
quarter last year only had two months of impact of the new dimensional weight pricing while this year it had three
months in the impact, so there was one difference in terms of months. Dimensional weight pricing, obviously, is the
standard in the industry and I will say that I think it's had a very positive effect on customers in terms of how they view
their packages and the package size. There's still a long way to go in that, but certainly there we made a lot of progress
in that regard.
I think you also had a comment about are you concerned about driving customers to find alternative or non-traditional
sources of parcel capacity. I'm not aware that there are any viable non-traditional sources of parcel capacity, especially
in peak season. So we certainly don't see that as an issue.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Allison Landry asked some questions about Parcel Select. I think I answered that in
the longer-winded answer I gave about route densities and revenue per delivery stop.
Art Hatfield of Raymond James – do you currently see any new regulatory headwinds on the horizon either here in the
U.S. or overseas? Art, this along with bad trade policy and bad tax policy is why we are seeing low GDP growth rate
and why global GDP has slowed down in global trade. I cannot tell you the onslaught of regulatory issues that we deal
with every day here. It's in every possible crevice of the organization, from the Department of Labor to the FAA to
protectionist policies camouflaged as security regulations overseas. If you don't try to stop these things, the natural
course of events is they come on the bottom of the ship like barnacles. So that's happening. And that's why we have low
growth rates. Bad policies on taxes and regulations in Europe, in the United States, in China, in Japan, and unless those
things turn around, you're going to continue to have low growth rates. So, Mickey, do you want to finish it up?
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay. Just one or two more questions, then we'll finish.
Operator
Okay. We'll move to the next question from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.
<Q - Kevin Wallance Sterling>: Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. In LTL volumes, you saw nice volume
growth. Are you seeing more growth on the economy side or the priority side? And how much is improved rail service
helping economy grow?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Yes, we had balanced growth between the two services, so there was no material difference
there.
<Q - Kevin Wallance Sterling>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
That does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn it back over to Mickey Foster for any final
or additional remarks.
