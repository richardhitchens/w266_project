MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello, and welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. first quarter 2014 earnings call. My name is [ph] Joe and I will be your
operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman,
you may begin.
Michael Kopelman
Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's first quarter earnings conference call.
This morning, we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter, and the other updating our
2014 full-year business outlook, which, as a reminder, includes Time, Inc.
Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on
our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also
included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current
expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various
factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on
Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly
disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise.

Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning.
We had an excellent first quarter. Excluding Time, Inc., revenues grew 10%, adjusted operating income increased 12%
and adjusted earnings per share was up 26%. We also generated over $1.7 billion in free cash flow. For just one quarter
into the year, that provides a pretty good indication of the return we can achieve on our investments in programming
and of the growth potential of our businesses. And as a result of our strong start to the year, this morning, we raised our
outlook for 2014 adjusted EPS to grow in the low teens. That's not an unusual level of growth for us. Over the past five
years, we've grown adjusted EPS, at least in the low teens, every year.
Our growth in any given year may be higher or lower depending on factors like the timing of new affiliate agreements,
or investments in programming. But, on average, we think we can continue to grow adjusted EPS in the low to
mid-teens, if not better, over at least the next three to four years. We have an established track record of turning solid
operating growth into even more attractive returns for our shareholders, and we're extremely confident we can continue
to do so for the foreseeable future.
Our confidence is underpinned by the strength of our brands, by industry leading scale across our businesses and by the
increasing value of our engaging and globally relevant content. All of those factors have been evident in our
negotiations during Turner's current domestic affiliate renewal cycle. In fact, based on the deals we've already
completed, we anticipate double-digit growth in domestic subscription revenue at Turner will extend another two years
beyond the 2013 through 2016 period that we previously discussed with you. That's double-digit growth, on average,
over five years, and it provides a lot of visibility into our earnings power over that time period.
Given our confidence in our growth prospects and strong cash generation year-to-date, we've decided to accelerate our
share repurchases, starting this quarter, and we now expect to reach our target net leverage of 2.75 times by the end of
this year.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes walking through some recent operational highlights. Nowhere was the growing
popularity and improving economics of our content more evident this quarter than at Warner Bros. In the first quarter
of 2014, Warner's picked up right where it left off last year, finishing number one at the domestic box office, and
collecting more academy awards than all the other major studios combined, led by seven for Gravity, including best
director for Alfonso Cuarón. Not bad for a movie that also finished with over $700 million at the global box office.
Warner's performance at the box office in the first quarter was a result of its continued development of franchise films
with global appeal, including The LEGO Movie, which was the quarter's number one release at the domestic box
office. And, 300: Rise of an Empire. Warner's is already working on another LEGO movie for release in 2017. We
think that LEGO has the ability to be an evergreen franchise that, along with DC comics and with J.K. Rowling's new
series of films, will underpin the economics of our film business for many, many years.
As you may know, our relationship with LEGO also includes important video game and television properties,
underscoring our ability to monetize high-quality intellectual property across the company. So with its strong start to
the year, a promising slate of movies for this summer, and a great lineup of television shows to be announced at the
upfronts in a couple of weeks, Warner's is in position to have another great year in 2014.
HBO also got off to a red-hot start this year, with True Detective garnering the largest ever viewership for a freshman
series on the HBO network. The success of True Detective means that HBO's current lineup includes four of its top five
highest rated shows ever. Of course, that includes Game of Thrones, which has become a global phenomenon. Season
four premiered to HBO's largest audiences since The Sopranos finale. And season three's home video release had the
highest first month sales of any HBO show ever in HBO's history. And, if anything, Game of Thrones has taught us a
vital lesson: decline any wedding invitation in Westeros.

The success of HBO's ground-breaking, original storytelling has always been a testament to visionary creators, such as
The Game of Thrones' team, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss; True Detective's Nic Pizzolatto, and Silicon Valley's Mike
Judge, and the fantastic actors that they attract, as well as the strength of HBO's brand and best in class marketing.
But I think HBO's record audiences are also a result of its leadership in making its content available on demand and
across all major platforms. We firmly believe that if you have great content, giving consumers control over where,
when, and on what platform they watch it, will drive increased consumption and value. That's the promise of TV
Everywhere, and there's no better example of that than HBO's success with HBO On Demand and HBO GO.
In keeping with the spirit of taking advantage of new platforms to connect with consumers and improve monetization,
HBO announced last week that it would be making a selection of its catalog programming available to Amazon Prime
Instant Video. We're hopeful that availability on Prime Instant Video will introduce additional consumers to the great
content that HBO produces, and will potentially drive sub additions over time to the HBO network service. And we
plan to use additional revenue from the deal to invest even more in HBO's ground-breaking, original programming, and
to further accelerate the development of the next generation of HBO GO.
It's that combination of unrivaled content, including the strongest slate of Hollywood movie hits and the use of the
latest technology, that has helped HBO become the world's leading premium TV and subscription video on demand
service. Given the positive subscriber trends we've seen both in recent years and so far in 2014, we feel great about
HBO's ability to drive continued growth for many years to come.
Turner also had a landmark start to the year, bringing the Elite Eight and the Final Four to cable for the first time ever.
The NCAA tournament continues to be a runaway success, and its strong linear TV performance was accentuated by
the more than 40% growth in digital video streams from March Madness Live. Like HBO GO, March Madness Live is
a great example of how TV Everywhere can enhance the consumer experience and the value of our networks to
distributors. And the success of the NCAA tournament helped TBS maintain its number one position in ad-supported
cable among adults 18-49.
Similarly, Adult Swim continues to lead the industry in attracting younger viewers once again, finishing the first
quarter as the number one ad-supported cable network in total day for adults 18-34. To better take advantage of the
growing demand for its distinctive content, we recently expanded Adult Swim to the 8:00 PM hour.
We also have momentum at CNN, which grew delivery in its key demo over 50% in March. Again, demonstrating that
it's the authoritative voice viewers turn to when news breaks. Just as important, CNN generated nearly 4 billion page
views and 275 million video starts in March. That's its biggest month ever for both metrics.
In a world where consumers increasingly look to digital products for their news, CNN has a substantial lead on its cable
news peers in cross platform unique users, and actually has the largest number of monthly unique mobile users of any
news service domestically, and we're just getting started. At its upfront earlier this month, CNN introduced CNNx,
which represents a leap forward in interactive news, and it's a product that CNN is uniquely positioned to provide. It's
available today on your tablet, and you'll start seeing it on set top boxes later this year. We think it will be another real
point of differentiation for CNN.
Despite these successes and having three of the top 10 cable networks in adults 18-49 in the first quarter, we are not
satisfied with the recent ratings and advertising performance at some of the Turner networks. At truTV, for example,
we followed a couple of strong years with a significant drop-off in performance. But we have new leadership in place
who just announced a slate of innovative unscripted programs that will start in May with The Carbonaro Effect, and
continue through this fall with shows like Motor City Masters, Way Out West and Hair Jacked. We think it's some of
the best and most creative programming the network has ever done, and that gives us great confidence in truTv and in
our ability to materially improve its monetization over time.
We've also had some challenges at TNT. It was a top five cable network in prime time last year, and it has some of the
most popular originals on basic cable, but it can and will do better. Over the past few years, we didn't take enough
creative risk with its programming and, as a result, TNT has lost ground with younger viewers. We've already started to
address that with the new programming that you'll see this summer, including The Last Ship, Murder in the First, and

Legends. These shows should also help TNT expand its audience with key male demos.
To be clear, these types of changes take time and we won't get to where we want to be in the next quarter or two. But
we've all seen that network performance tends to move in cycles, and by virtue of its scale and our position as the
world's leading producer of high-quality television product, TNT has access to all the resources it needs. We're
confident and we're determined that we will see improvement as the year progresses, and that we can drive growth in
its audience and its economics over time.
At Time, Inc., the new management team has made great progress in preparing for success as an independent public
company. We're on track to complete the spin in the next month or so, and you'll hear more about their plans as that
date approaches.
So, in closing, I'm really pleased with how we started 2014. We're making progress on our strategic initiatives across
the company and, at the same time, our investments in great storytelling and journalism are paying off, allowing us to
produce very attractive financial results. And with the global growth in demand for our content continuing unabated,
we think we're in a great position to grow at these kinds of attractive levels for a very long time.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Howard.
Howard M. Averill
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning.
I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Given that we expect
to complete the spinoff of Time, Inc. this quarter, and our full year outlook excludes Time, Inc., I will focus my
remarks on our company results prepared on the same basis. Excluding Time, Inc., revenues were up 10% and with
leverage all the way down the income statement, with adjusted operating income increasing 12% and adjusted EPS
growing 26%. Turner, HBO, and Warner Bros. all posted record first quarter adjusted operating income.
So to reiterate what Jeff said, we're off to a great start in 2014. Adjusted operating income margins expanded 60 basis
points, despite a 9% increase in expenses, and that expense growth was largely related to content investments at Warner
Bros. and Turner and the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic.
SG&A was flat in the quarter, and it would have been down excluding the consolidations as we continue to focus on
funding aggressive investments in programming by limiting growth in other expenses.
We're able to grow adjusted EPS even faster than adjusted operating income due mostly to our ongoing share repurpose
program and improved results at our equity investments including HBO Latin America. We also had a benefit of almost
$40 million from the recognition of interest income on a long standing note receivable that was collected.
During the quarter we repurchased close to $1 billion in shares, and combined with our dividend, we've returned almost
$1.6 billion to shareholders year-to-date.
We also had a very strong quarter for free cash flow, generating $1.7 billion, a nearly 80% increase from last year's first
quarter. And as Jeff mentioned, in light of our strong first quarter and our confidence in the remainder of the year we've
raised our 2014 outlook for adjusted EPS excluding Time, Inc. We now expect growth to be in the low teens. I'll touch
more on the details of our outlook throughout the presentation.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where revenues and adjusted operating income continue to
grow despite ratings and FX headwinds. Subscription revenues grew 7% in the quarter, which included a more than 100
basis point drag from FX. Domestic subscription revenue growth was solidly in the high single digits, a significant
acceleration relative to the past couple of years. And that acceleration was a result of rate increases related to Turner's
domestic affiliate renewals.

Excluding the impact of FX, international subscription revenue was also up in the high single digits with the largest
gains coming from Latin America, which remains our strongest region and where we continue to see healthy subscriber
trends. Looking forward, we'll continue to benefit from Turner's domestic affiliate renewals for the remainder of the
year. And as Jeff noted, we anticipate this will be a sustained lift in our subscription revenue growth rate. Based on
deals we already have in place, we expect to grow our domestic subscription revenue at low double-digit rates on
average through 2018.
Turning to advertising, revenues increased 5% in the quarter, which was at the lower end of the range we originally
expected, and that included the impact of both soft ratings and moderate demand in the scatter market. Of that growth,
about 300 basis points was due to the NCAA Tournament, including the benefit from airing two NCAA Elite Eight
games. Domestic advertising increased similarly to the overall result, and that included a mid-single-digit increase of
domestic entertainment including kids and young adults and a low single-digit growth at our news networks.
Excluding a drag of approximately 400 basis points from FX, international advertising would have been up high single
digits. That reflected solid underlying growth in Latin America and international news.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, scatter pricing is up high single to lower double-digits over the upfront. The
volume's still relatively modest and we expect ratings to remain a drag on our performance. Also keep in mind that as a
result of airing two Final Four games, the NCAA should provide around a 300 basis point benefit in the quarter. Taking
all of that into account, we anticipate total advertising to grow in the local single digits in the second quarter.
Moving on, adjusted operating income grew 3% in the quarter, and that included a 9% increase in programming cost,
primarily due to the NCAA Tournament and continued investments in original programming across our networks.
Consistent with our focus on cost discipline, we limited non-programming expense growth to just 2% in the quarter.
As we look to the remainder of 2014, we anticipate Turner's adjusted operating income growth to accelerate, starting in
the second quarter. And despite ongoing investments in sports and original programming, we expect solid margin
expansion for the year. So Turner is on pace for another good year in 2014.
Moving on to HBO, where we saw strong growth in both revenues and adjusted operating income, subscription
revenues were up 8% in the quarter with the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributing around 400
basis points to that growth.
Building on a strong 2013, our domestic subscriber trends remain positive, and similar to the past few quarters, the
majority of recent subscriber additions have been non-revenue generating. So while it's a good barometer of consumer
demand for HBO, subscriber growth did not have a material impact on our revenue.
Turning to content revenues, which were up 13% in the quarter, that was primarily due to very strong home video sales
of season three of Game of Thrones, which more than offset softness in library product.
Looking ahead, we anticipate a significant bump in content revenues in the second quarter due to the Amazon deal
announced last week. As Jeff noted, HBO intends to invest the majority of proceeds from the transaction back into
programming, marketing and technology. So we don't expect a commensurate increase in profits this year.
Adjusted operating income was up 11% in the quarter, and margins expanded almost 100 basis points and that was
despite the drag on margins from the international consolidations.
Programming expenses increased 8%, with 600 basis points of that growth due to the consolidation. Underneath that,
acquired theatrical expenses increased, while programming write-offs decreased. Absent the programming write-offs,
original programming expenses would have increased in the mid-single digits.
Across HBO's international properties, first quarter results were equally impressive. Total international revenue
including unconsolidated JVs was up double digits, and subscriber trends remain strong, especially in Latin America.
Like the rest of the company, HBO remains focused on containing overhead in order to help fund investments in
programming and technology. And adjusting for the international consolidations, SG&A was down in the quarter and

total non-programming expenses were up just 2%. So HBO started the year with a lot of momentum from both an
operating and a financial perspective, and it's on track for another year of solid growth.
Turning now to Warners, which had a record first quarter, growing revenue by 14% and adjusted operating income by
more than 40%. Strong theatrical performance was the biggest driver of growth in the quarter, led by the box office
success of The LEGO Movie and 300: Rise of an Empire as well as carryover revenue from the latest Hobbit
installment and Gravity.
On the TV side, revenue and associated profits grew due to higher initial telecast revenue related to increased
production as well as continued growth from international syndication. We also benefited from double-digit gains in
SVOD revenue, mainly due to international growth. We continue to see healthy demand for our product from SVOD
services and expect contributions from the SVOD distribution channel to increase this year.
Across theatrical and TV home entertainment revenue was down in the quarter largely due to the timing of the release
of the latest Hobbit installment on home video, which is in the second quarter this year versus the first quarter last year.
Despite that, digital trends remain positive, with Warners' electronic sell-through up over 20% in the first quarter.
Consumer spending across the broader home video market was also down in the first quarter due to a softer theatrical
slate and the timing of Easter. But digital growth was even stronger for the industry with electronic sell-through up
45%. So on the whole, we've been very encouraged by the ongoing transition to digital. To help drive that transition,
Warners continues to champion industry-wide digital ownership initiatives like Ultraviolet, which now has over 17
million accounts.
Looking ahead, Warners has very difficult theatrical comparisons for the rest of the year. Even so, given a strong start
theatrically, and positive trends in the TV business, Warners is on pace for another record year in 2014.
Now on to Time, Inc., where the new management team is driving significant changes critical to its success as an
independent public company. Revenues increased 1% in the quarter and benefited from the acquisition of American
Express Publishing Corporation. Excluding this, revenues would have decreased 5%, with advertising down 7% and
subscriptions flat. Revenues also benefited from one additional issue each of People and Time compared to last year.
Adjusted operating loss was $94 million, and that was primarily a result of $115 million in restructuring charges in the
quarter. To offset challenging revenue trends, the management team has been extremely focused on cost discipline and
changing the way Time, Inc. operates with the goal of stabilizing the business and freeing up resources to invest in
growth initiatives and excluding the acquisition and restructuring charges, expenses fell 3% in the quarter.
Looking forward, Time, Inc. remains on track with the outlook we provided in February. Excluding restructuring and
severance charges, we expect modest declines in full year adjusted operating income in 2014, and that's largely a
function of continuing revenue pressure and incremental public company and stock compensation expenses that Time,
Inc. will incur this year.
As Jeff noted, we remain on track to complete the spinoff of Time, Inc. this quarter. And as part of that process, Time,
Inc. recently issued senior notes and senior commitments for $1.4 billion in debt and a $500 million revolver, that's
consistent with our plan for an initial capital structure that includes approximately $1.3 billion in net debt. We think
this will allow sufficient flexibility to both invest in the business and provide direct returns to shareholders while also
optimizing its cost of capital and delivering attractive levered equity returns to investors. Time, Inc. has made a lot of
progress and well on its way to executing against its goals for the year, and successfully making the transition to a
standalone public company.
Moving to free cash flow and including Time, Inc. which was very strong in the quarter. The big year-over-year
improvement is primarily due to the strong growth in adjusted operating income and a favorable swing in working
capital. The improvement in working capital reflects lower participations in production spend due to title mix at Warner
Bros. and the timing of sports programming payments at Turner.
Cash interest improved due to the receipt of interest income I noted earlier, but given the additional debt we took on
late last year, we expect cash interest to increase for the remainder of the year.

The decline in cash taxes was primarily the result of the timing of audit settlements. As with interest expense, our cash
taxes are likely to be higher for the full year due to the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation.
Putting that all together, we do not expect free cash flow to grow at this level for the year. Nonetheless, we're off to a
great start from a cash perspective, and we fully expect to deliver another year of strong free cash flow in 2014. Now,
on to net debt.
We ended the first quarter with $16.7 billion of net debt, down versus the end of 2013 due to the very strong free cash
flow generation I just noted and $1.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of our office space in Time Warner Center. Our
net leverage ratio was 2.2 times, as of March 31. We returned about $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of
dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, and that's consistent with our continued commitment to provide
direct returns to shareholders.
As Jeff mentioned, we intend to move to our target net leverage ratio of 2.75 times by the end of 2014, which is faster
than our initial plan. Our decision to move more quickly to our target leverage is a reflection of both our confidence in
the company's outlook, and our view that our stock is very attractive at current levels. In light of that, we'll be
accelerating our share repurchase program in the coming quarters. By moving more quickly to our target leverage, we
will also move back toward a more efficient cash position, following significant inflows from the sale of our office
space and the Time, Inc. spin.
At the same time, we continue to invest aggressively in our business. We've already discussed the investments we are
making in great content across our divisions. We're also investing in strategic M&A to improve our competitive
position, add new capabilities, and accelerate growth, especially outside the U.S. While we don't need to do M&A,
we're always open to opportunities that complement our existing assets and provide risk-adjusted returns that are more
attractive than our alternative uses of capital. And already this year, we've committed over $700 million to acquire
Eyeworks' international television production operations and to fund an additional round of investment in CME. This
combination of investing in our businesses, opportunistic M&A, and significant direct return to shareholders, is the
same balanced approach to capital allocation we've been employing for a number of years now, and we still believe it's
the right approach today.
Now on to the final slide which shows our outlook for 2014. We had a great first quarter and feel really good about
how we are positioned for the rest of this year. That's given us the confidence to raise our full-year 2014 outlook to low
teens adjusted EPS growth. Keep in mind, that's despite our expectation of a negative swing in inter-company
eliminations and a higher effective tax rate. Between the two, we still anticipate a negative year-over-year impact of
approximately $0.15 to $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the year.
Looking more closely at the second quarter, we have a somewhat more challenging comparison against what was a
very strong quarter a year ago. Even so, we anticipate solid growth in both adjusted operating income and adjusted
EPS. We're doing all this while investing aggressively for future growth, and as Jeff mentioned, we think we can
continue to grow adjusted EPS at attractive levels for the foreseeable future.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.

[Operator Instructions] It looks like our first question here comes from Mr. Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Megan Durkin>: Hi. This is actually Megan Durkin, standing in for Doug. You talked a couple times about the
softness in the scatter market. I'm curious to hear how the tone is in the sports advertising market and how that
compares to the entertainment ad market. And then, I have a follow-up.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Well, scatter has been relatively steady. On the sports side, it tends to be a little bit softer. I
think what's happening is, we're seeing some pull from World Cup coming out of the marketplace, just like we saw in
the first quarter with the Olympics. So it's a little bit softer than we had anticipated.
<Q - Megan Durkin>: Okay. And the entertainment is just going along similar to how it's been? Kind of a little soft?
A – [0BJHD5-E Howard Averill]>: Well, I would say that, what I just stated, generally speaking, that we're not seeing
quite as much volume. On the entertainment side, we're seeing more of a drag from the ratings side, more so than just
the volume. It's more on the – there's a drag from the ratings.
<Q - Megan Durkin>: Right. And then, on a completely different topic, I was interested to hear how Jeff would
respond to Jeff Katzenberg's recent comments, when he was quoted as saying that movies are not a growth business,
but television is.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Well, maybe for him. He doesn't make very many movies. We've been doing fine in movies.
And let's just put some context on it. So, 2013 for Warner Bros. was a record year, domestically. And we had a very
strong slate. We were number one in the box office. I think 2014 is off to a strong start. It's up about 7% in the first
quarter. And we also see continued growth overseas, which has become a bigger driver of our business.
International demand, on the theatrical side, is particularly strong for the kinds of event films that we produce, and
we've already talked in our – what we've said already about the films that we had, including LEGO and 300 this first
quarter. But if you go to the rest of the year, we do have some tough comparisons given how strong we were last year.
But we had a great year last year.
For the rest of 2014, the slate looks good. We have Godzilla coming, Edge of Tomorrow, and the final installment of
The Hobbit. So we think we're going to have a record year in 2014. We do think we can grow the business over time
and we've been doing it. So we don't agree with that view. And I think it may be, the business they are in is quite
different.
<Q - Megan Durkin>: Okay, thanks.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Mr. Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you. Jeff, the extension of your affiliate revenue growth trajectory, the
double-digit CAGR into 2018, trying to get a sense for sort of how much is fully baked already. You've talked about a
CAGR through 2016, and you had 7 of the top 10 deals done. Can you give us some context on the 2018 outlook? Why
did you decide to reveal that to us today, and sort of what's the new distribution landscape look like and your decision
to go there? And, obviously, that lifts the growth of the company and the earnings of the company over multiple years.
Just want to get a little more color on that. And on HBO, the subscriber trends are great. What has to happen to
translate the subscriber growth to better revenue growth in the U.S.?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Let's do the Turner first. The reason we wanted to go farther out, we've had the deals that
we've been mentioning in place for a while. But, we'd given guidance out three years. We thought that was enough, in
terms of how our affiliate deals were going. We kept getting questions about our growth after 2016. Since we have
pretty good visibility in it, we thought we ought to say, since we have deals that go beyond 2016, we should provide a
little more clarity. The rate increases we have received, not just through 2016, but also through 2018, because the

outlook for the three years, through 2016, hasn't changed. It's still the attractive ramp that we told you about before. But
it just continues for a couple more years. We thought we ought to say that. So that's the Turner side.
In terms of HBO, there's really strong programming, there's strong critics and ratings performance, there's strong
take-up of GO, there's strong take-up of international subscriber growth, and there's a pretty robust, steady trend in
domestic, which I think is where your question is focused. And, basically, there's two ways to improve the mix, in
terms of how we do the deals, to provide incentives for affiliate performance.
First, we can focus more resources working with our underperforming affiliates, and that's a combination of incentives
and other actions to get out of those markets the natural HBO subscriber penetrations that HBO really earns, in terms of
its programming. If we're not going to get it through the affiliates that are underperforming, we're going to find ways to
make that happen.
Second, we look to share the upside of our best performing affiliates, and those are the ones who have been really
setting a clear benchmark for where HBO can go. And so, when we take those deal structures and fit into them more
HBO participation in the upside, that takes a little bit of time as the renewals come in.
And then, finally, if you add on top of that some of the innovations that certain affiliates come up with, which are lower
priced packages that you can put HBO in, some broadband-only efforts by facility-based distributors, these are all
pretty promising. And I'm not going to get more specific, but what we have, which is the fundamental, underlying grid
fact, is that the viewers love the HBO programming. The lights and ability of HBO GO to provide it in very exciting
ways is increasing, and the upside that we get from less producing ability on our part is to invest a lot more in
programming. We're going to use most of the proceeds from the Amazon transaction to increase our programming
going forward. So it's adding up to a very nice platform for future growth, for acceleration of HBO revenue and
earnings growth.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Thank you. I have two. One is for Howard and one is for Jeff. Howard, first, on SVOD.
You guys have been pretty transparent about SVOD revenues over the past couple years. I know you won't call out
Amazon particularly, but can you give us a sense, in 2014, how big will SVOD get for the company when you look at
the entire landscape of SVOD deals? You think it's $500 million or so for 2014?
And then for Jeff, I wondered what the move to Amazon represents, in terms of what you see for HBO GO, in terms of
usage trends. Are you seeing pretty much the usage trends focused on newer product, and, therefore, the catalog has
been pretty much tapped out by HBO GO, and you think it's a chance that people have never seen it before? So what do
you have on the research on usage by catalog versus new?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Okay, Michael, first on SVOD. So the starting point, we generated about $375 million last
year, and that was up slightly from 2012, and we think that's going to be at the top of our competitive set. And, by the
way, that doesn't include the revenue that the CW Network directly receives from SVOD, which is pretty significant.
Even without the HBO-Amazon deal, we think we're going to be able to grow that again in 2014. And in terms of
where the growth is coming from, a lot of that is coming from international territories.
But, again, to keep the overall thing in perspective, it is a small portion of our overall revenue. It's about 10% of our TV
licensing revenue last year. It's only about 3% of film and TV revenue. More importantly, it's probably the fact that it's
clear that there is consumer demand for this content in an On Demand environment, and that's particularly true for past
seasons of serialized shows. So I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to continue to monetize that content
moving forward.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Do you have a number in mind? Sorry.

<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: So you're asking about, basically, the usage in On-Demand of HBO viewers between
different categories of programming, older newer movie, series, et cetera. Is that what you're asking?
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Right.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: So let me try to – that gives me a lot of good news and which good news outweighs this
other good news. So you've all read in the press the fairly impressive numbers for HBO VOD usage on current episodes
of Game of Thrones or True Detective and so on. There's a tremendous usage going on of all current and new series.
There's also, which has not gotten enough attention, a fairly strong usage, both in linear programming and in some
on-demand usage, on the movie slate. Let's not forget the movie slate at HBO. It's got by far the strongest lineup of
current movie releases.
What we're seeing, though, when we go and we look at the interest the viewers have all around the world and you put it
in your question, a lot of people didn't see some of the classic hits at HBO. And so, when you make them available,
whether it's the Amazon Prime deal, where you're going to see tremendous shows like Sopranos, that most Amazon
Prime subs don't have HBO. So it's a great opportunity to familiarize them with HBO programming, get them interested
as prospects for our HBO sub, the affiliates that sell HBO. So it's a tremendous marketing thing for HBO subscribers
over time, in addition to being a very fertile place for people to buy HBO programming.
So most of this, you do relativity. Most of it, huge viewing goes to current series, but I think we're going to see some
fairly strong viewing and sampling of the HBO classics and the library shows that are coming on Amazon.
A – [0BJHD5-E Howard Averill]>: Hey, and Michael, just to follow up on the financials of the Amazon deal, we're not
going to disclose the specifics, but it is a multi-year deal and we're going to be recognizing revenue reasonably evenly
over all years of the contract. So in 2014, we're going to see a pretty – we're going to recognize pretty much all the
revenue related to the transaction in the second quarter. So we're going to see a pretty sizable bump. There's going to be
a benefit that HBO sees in the second quarter, and you're going to see similar lumpy recognition in future years. But in
terms of the overall profits, we intend to invest most of those proceeds back into the business, including spending on
additional programming, marketing and technology spend, so the impact of 2014 is not significant.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yeah, so let me add this quick. So the move up, which we're telling you about, the strong
year we're having in 2014 and the increase in guidance is mostly core trends at Time Warner, it is not basically – it's
not in a large part coming out of the Amazon. That's a little part of it, but we're going to invest most of that month.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Okay, thanks, guys.
Operator
And thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - David Bank>: Hey, thanks very much, guys. Kind of a follow-up on something. I think, given your commentary
around ratings, it definitely sounds like the softness, you know, ex the NCAAs over the past couple quarters have
clearly been driven by content cyclicality as opposed to secular issues, but I wanted to try and drill down a little further
because I think this has been something of a hot topic recently for investors, especially around the upfront.
So, I was wondering if you take the sort of core low single-digit growth numbers ex the impact of the NCAAs shifting
that you have a really enormous portfolio and there are different day parts, different demo targets, really hard for, I
think, us to track ratings on the outside in a specific way. Can you give us kind of an aggregate revenue weighted basis
GRP decline so that we could – how much of this is about pricing versus by impressions, right? And I don't mean like
scatter pricing over the upfront, but actual kind of blended pricing increases.
And then, I guess, the second part of that is, Jeff, specifically, you know, could you kind of comment on your thoughts
right now about the secular strength of national cable advertising dollars versus some of these digital guys fighting for
wallet share? Thanks very much.

<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yeah. Thanks. You know, I sympathize with that question. You're trying to pull a pattern
out.
<Q - David Bank>: Thank you for your sympathy.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yeah. Sometimes when we're talking amongst ourselves we say let me try to collect your
thoughts or my thoughts. I would simplify. So basically it's about ratings. And the – which Howard tried to get at. We
have stronger and weaker ratings performance – we think that if you really get into the underperformance that we're
seeing, which we think – it's essentially ratings, a little bit of market but it's mostly ratings and on that issue, and the –
you know, it's like anything, follow the money, the big money is at TBS, TNT.
TNT has been softer than it should have been, as we've talked about. But let's get into that from an investment point of
view. The way we look at it, we've got the two strongest big reach networks in cable, TBS, TNT, and a lot of other
networks that are very strong, none of them are flank or weak networks. And we need to refresh the original
programming, and we've got a budget that we've talked to you about that's on our trend line that gives us plenty of
money to move towards younger skewing programming, edgier programming that will fit those brands.
And to the question of how should we view the likelihood of our succeeding, let's remind ourselves that Warner Bros.
is Hollywood's leading TV studio, HBO has been more successful with its original programming and our network.
Turner has had some great success in broad reach, somewhat too old skewing originals which we're now going to focus
very intently on doing younger ones.
If there's nothing else to tell you about Time Warner across those divisions we know how to create successful TV
series. And since Turner has had its share of hits and we're now moving the target towards younger male and female
skewing stuff and we have new management that's going to actively pursue this, we think that we'll be able to do this
and come up with something – look, we've got to do it, not to be complacent, I'm not saying anything to be complacent
about it, but we're very excited about it and we think we have all the pieces to have very strong programming strength
there over time. It's going to take a little while but let's keep a couple of ratings things in perspective so you don't
over-focus on current softness at Turner, which is that the Turner domestic advertising is less than 15% of total
company revenue. Now, as it turns around, that will be a nice lift for us. But just keep that in mind. TBS, was still
number one in 18-49 and 18-34 in prime time in the first quarter. Adult Swim remains number one in 18-34 and 18-49
in total day.
Now TNT, which had the softest, was a top five network in 2013 now it's slipped off a little and CNN is showing great
momentum right now, but if you go back basically to TBS and TNT, the answer to your question is the ratings are
softer than they're going to be, and unless we just can't figure out how to do it, which would be, I guess, the only
downside, this is all going to get a lot better and turn into a fairly strong midterm and out earnings story at Turner.
A – [0BJHD5-E Howard Averill]>: So David, let me just give you a little more context about the current trends. It is a
combination of factors. So, looking at the second quarter, for example, scatter pricing for our entertainment networks is
up. It's still up high single to low double digits over the upfront. But, again as I mentioned, we're just not seeing much
volume overall. And also just generally speaking true but also more for sports.
So, as I mentioned, we saw demand siphoned off in the first quarter and the second quarter we're seeing it with World
Cup, and again the ratings tend to be a little bit of a drag. Further than that on the international side, we're also seeing a
slight drag from FX and the World Cup but going in the other direction we do expect a 300 basis benefit from the
NCAA in the second quarter.
So, as I said in my prepared remarks, that all translates into low single-digit growth in advertising but from where we
sit today that would probably be on the lower end of low single digits. So if that gives you a little more confidence.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: For that quarter.
A – [0BJHD5-E Howard Averill]>: For the quarter, right.

<Q - David Bank>: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question here comes from Mr. Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks a lot. I have two questions for either Howard or Jeff. You guys mentioned that
the Amazon revenue will be recognized evenly over the horizon of the contract and you also said most of this year's
revenue will be reinvested in programming and other expenses.
So my question is: Should we think about this year as a one-time step-up in investment in HBO or do you think that the
incremental margin on that kind of evenly paced Amazon revenue will expand in 2015?
And then my second question would be in terms of the new guidance or the extension other than the double-digit
domestic affiliate fee growth, how should we think about how international plays into it over the course of time over
that extended five-year period of time? Do you think that international cable will be accretive to that growth rate on the
domestic side or not? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Let me do the first one. I may ask you about the second one. On the HBO Amazon, you
know, what percent of the revenue lift do we decide to take into earnings in a given year and whether – so we said
we're going to invest most of it in programming and technical capacity for GO because it's expanding so well. You
know, it's probably the – our margin on it would go up over the next few years but we may decide to invest it as we go
in more programming that we find pretty attractive and that programming but not just supporting service subscriber
revenue and profits domestically and overseas, there's things when we have them and we like them, look at Game of
Thrones. We haven't even sold it yet. They turn into tremendous sources of content revenue and profit with very large
contribution once you get past [indiscernible] [52:44]. So depending what we've got, we'll decide later whether we take
more of it into earnings or whether we just use it to expand the future earnings, basically.
Now the other...
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Got it.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: ...what was the other question? Could you do it again? We didn't understand.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: No, the other question is as we model Turner going forward, you've got domestic and
international, you guys are providing guidance on the domestic side and we're just trying to figure out what that equates
to on a global basis, so over the next five years do you expect the international piece to be accretive or dilutive to your
double-digit affiliate fee guidance on the domestic side. Is that clear?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: You're trying to find out if international is double-digit on its own basis? Is that what you're
saying?
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Yeah, that'd be great to know.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: We're trying to figure out if we have thought of it that way. The international trends are
really strong. Does anybody have the exact percentage growth of...?
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Up high single digits in the first quarter but...
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Probably better.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Well, we think it's going to be that but there's been a drag on FX particularly this year but
it's growing from an organic standpoint in the high single digits.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Well, maybe another way to ask the question would be, you have these deals in place on
the domestic side that are long-term and multiyear. Do you have that kind of visibility internationally that would give
you the conviction to put forth kind of a similar type of affiliate guidance for international or...?

<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yeah, well, international's not one country, it's many so there's no simple answer, it's each
territory is different. The sub growth is – so here's the – let's do it. In Latin America, which is our biggest region, the
biggest driver is not the price increase in the affiliate deals, many of which we have going on, and there's some decent
price increases, most of it is volume increases that are pretty significant and you can just look at the numbers we've
been posting and see extremely strong secular sub growth all across Latin America, our biggest region.
You, then, go into our other regions, Eastern Europe, the rim of Asia, we're launching new networks such as HBO in
the Netherlands and the Nordic regions and India, CNN in Indonesia, truTV in Brazil, TNT in Chile and some of the
other expansion of our South American source channels. So, generally we don't see that much of the – more of the
increase overseas is in sub growth than in pricing.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Right.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Because it's similar to the stage of development that the international markets are in. What's
good about that is that the international trends are [indiscernible] (55:32). And if you don't have FX going against you,
you'd probably be in a pretty steady double-digit neighborhood.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Got you. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: It's hard to say what FX trends are going to be.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Sure. Okay. Thanks.
Operator
And thank you. Our next question here comes from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Thank you, good morning. Jeff I wanted to follow up on your comments on the Turner and
upcoming turnaround hopefully in ratings and programming. You said that some of the originals ended up skewing
older than – was that by design or did it just end up doing that?
And I wonder if you could tell us where you think, I'm sure you have very sophisticated research, where the viewers
went and where assuming the cable total viewership is stable, whom should you take share from with the new
programming at Turner?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: All right, yeah, so, you know, the – I think the first part of your question is do you – is the
reason our Turner – some of our Turner, particularly on TNT skewed older, is it because we aimed for that?
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Correct.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: And hit the target. And the answer is yes. So that actually gives us a fair amount of
confidence that when we move the sighting of what we're aiming at, we'll hit that target, too.
The reason we were doing the former aim at big general entertainment audiences is that it had come off the very
successful Turner strategy of being the network – the broadcast network replacement, and that was working great with
advertisers and audiences. There were shows like The Closer, Rizzoli and Isles, which had the biggest audiences in
cable right next to a broadcast series.
But what's happened, I think as we all know, is that the younger viewership has become more important, and the
advertiser interest in more younger skewing, a little edgier programming than what they wanted to buy a couple of
years ago, has become pretty pronounced.
Some of that is probably because there have been some very good series that showed up on some basic networks that
were like that. Breaking Bad is a good example. And some of it is because everyone has gotten a little change in their
view, advertisers included, but viewers too, that came out of subscription VOD shows that are serialized and edgier.
And so basically the interest of the audience and the growth of the younger audience which makes that the better target.

<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yes. More ratings, higher CPMs, more money.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Vasily. Joe [ph], we have time for just one more question.
Operator
And thank you. Yes, our last question here will come from Mr. Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thanks, good morning, guys. Two questions, one for Jeff.
Disney and DISH recently reached a deal that allows them to provide a personal subscription service by broadband and
it requires more participation, so my question is, you know, have you considered that? Are you discussing the topic
with DISH? And what would it take for you to get involved or to participate in a service like that?
And then Howard, just on return of capital, clearly great cash flow and return of capital's primarily focused on the share
repurchases. Can you talk a little bit about the thought process of continuing with repurchases versus dividends, just
given how strong and stable and growing your affiliate streams are – could support a higher dividend growth story?
Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: All right, let me start on the DISH question. So DISH, Sony, Verizon are all expressing
interest in virtual MVPDs. There is a lot of discussion about this. Of course we're talking with all of them as we have
been and are certainly open to opportunities to grow our business. We're not philosophically opposed to that kind of
structure, but we have to believe it will be additive and sustainable. And so there are a fair number of questions in terms
of the ad model, the quality of service over whichever broadband method they're thinking about and how this would
impact investment in the plant that we all need to develop high-quality TV.
But what you asked about, I think, specifically, which is the DISH-Disney arrangement, could be interesting for us.
And it's not so different than the Comcast innovation, selling HBO on a lightweight TV package. So, yes, we're talking
to DISH about whether there's some applicability of that for us. It could allow them and other distributors to target a
group of consumers that otherwise might not subscribe to multichannel TV. And to the extent that that is a good entree
into the ecosystem for younger consumers, that then, either because it serves them well and does not cannibalize what
they would otherwise do as a video subscriber or leads them to become bigger package video subscribers, that's good
for everybody. So we are exploring that.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Michael on dividends versus buybacks, obviously we think both should play a role in our
effort to provide direct returns. But it's important to note that we have the highest payout and the highest dividend
yields of our peer group. We announced a 10% increase in our dividend back in February. At the same time, as we
mentioned earlier, we think the stock is attractive, so we also find repurchasing shares to be a good vehicle for the
additional returns to shareholders. And this is all really consistent with what we've done in the past few years, and the
philosophy's really not changing so there's no reason to expect that we're going to deviate from that formula.
