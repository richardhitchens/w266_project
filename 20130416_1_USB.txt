I will now turn the call over to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review U.S. Bank's first quarter results.
I'd like to begin with a few quarterly highlights on page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.4
billion for the first quarter of 2013, or $0.73 per diluted common share; although the total net revenue of $4.9 billion
was slightly lower than the same quarter of last year and the previous quarter, due to reduction in total expense, we
achieved positive operating leverage year-over-year and linked quarter.
Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5.8% and as expected, 1% or 4% annualized linked quarter. We
experienced strong growth in total average deposits of 7.3% over the prior year and 0.5% over the fourth quarter of
2012. Credit quality remains strong.
Total net charge-offs decreased by $35 million or 7.5% from the prior quarter while nonperforming assets declined at
9.9% linked quarter or 2.8% excluding covered asset. We generated significant capital this quarter. Our estimated Tier
1 common ratio under the most recent Basel III rules was 8.2% at March 31st with the Basel I, Tier 1 common equity
ratio of 9.1% and Tier 1 capital ratio of 11%. We repurchased 17 million shares of common stock during the first
quarter, which along with our dividend, resulted in a 69% return of earnings to our shareholders in the first quarter.
Slide 4 provides you with the trends in our industry-leading performance metrics. Return on average assets in the first
quarter was 1.65% and return on average common equity was 16%.
Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right-hand side of slide 4. This quarter's net
interest margin of 3.48% was, as expected 7 basis points lower than the prior quarter's rate of 3.55%. Andy will discuss
the margin in more detail in a few minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 50.7%, better than the prior
year and the previous quarter. We continued to manage our operating expenses effectively and in line with revenue
trends. We expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to
revenue trends while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.
Turning to slide 5, the company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.9 billion, a 1.1% decrease from the
prior year and a 4.7% decrease from the previous quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by
mortgage banking while the linked quarter variance reflected both a reduction in mortgage banking, as well as normal
first quarter seasonality within our business lines.
Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12
billion or 5.8% year-over-year and 1% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans of run-off portfolio, average
total loans grew by 8% year-over-year and 1.4% linked quarter.
Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average commercial loans which
grew by 16.8% year-over-year and 2.3% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also increased
over the prior quarters. Residential real estate loans continued to show strong growth, 19.2% over the same quarter of
last year and 4.5% over the prior quarter.
Within the retail loan category, average credit card loan outstanding fell slightly as consumers paid down their
balances. And average home equity lines and loans continued to decline as pay downs more than offset new loan
originations. Auto loans and leases; however, posted good growth year-over-year.
We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage
production, plus new and renewed commitments totaled over $35 billion in the first quarter. Total average revolving
corporate and commercial commitments increased year-over-year by 11.9% and 1.7% on a linked quarter basis, while
utilization remains stable at approximately 25%, basically where it's been for the past five quarters.

Total average deposits increased by $16.7 billion, or 17.3% over the same quarter of last year, and by $1.2 billion on a
linked quarter basis with growth in low cost savings deposits particularly strong on a linked quarter basis.
Turning to slide 7 and credit quality, total net charge-offs in the first quarter decreased by $35 million, or 7.5% from
the fourth quarter of 2012, while nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets decreased by $59 million, or 2.8%.
The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the first quarter declined to 0.79%, from 0.85% in fourth
quarter.
During the first quarter, we released $30 million of reserves compared with $25 million in the fourth quarter and $90
million in the first quarter of 2012. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we expect net charge-offs to remain
relatively stable in the second quarter while non-performing assets will continue to trend lower.
Andy will now give you a few more details about our first quarter results.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our first quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted
EPS of $0.73 was 9% higher than the first quarter of 2012 and 1.4% higher than the prior quarter. For comparison
purposes, recall that the fourth quarter of 2012 results included an $80 million foreclosure related settlement expense
accrual that reduced EPS by $0.03.
The key drivers of the company's first quarter earnings are summarized on slide 9. The $90 million or 6.7% increase in
net income year-over-year was the result of a decrease in expense and a lower provision for credit losses slightly offset
by a reduction in net revenue.
Net interest income increased year-over-year by $19 million or 0.7%. The favorable variance was largely driven by a
$13.9 billion increase in average earning assets mostly offset by a decrease in net interest margin. The 4.6% growth in
average earning assets included increases in average total loans and loans held for sale, as well as planned increases in
the securities portfolio.
The net interest margin of 3.48% was 12 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, primarily due to lower
yielding investment securities and lower loan rates partially offset by lower rates on deposits and wholesale funding
and a reduction in cash balances held at the Fed.
Noninterest income declined by 3.3% year-over-year, primarily due to mortgage banking revenue reflecting lower
origination and sales revenue partially offset by higher servicing revenue and favorable change in the addition of the
mortgage reps and warranty repurchase reserve.
Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income year-over-year were lower equity investment gains, retail
products revenue, primarily due to fewer cars coming off lease and a commercial products revenue. Offsetting these
declines were increases in trust and investment management fees, retail payments and merchant processing revenue.
Noninterest expense was lower year-over-year by $90 million or 3.5%.
The majority of this favorable variance is attributable to favorable variance in regulatory, insurance and litigation items
partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and an increase in tax credit investment costs, net
occupancy and technology expense.
Net income was higher on a linked quarter basis by $8 million or 0.6% as a result of an 8% decline in expense and a
lower provision for credit losses partially offset by a 4.7% decrease in net revenue. On a linked quarter basis, net
interest income was lower as growth in average earning assets of $1.8 billion was offset by a 7 basis point decline in
net interest margin and the impact of two fewer days.
The 7 basis point decline in net interest margin was primarily due to lower loan and securities rates and seasonally
lower loan fees. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $164 million, or 7%. This unfavorable
variance was primarily the result of a decrease in mortgage banking revenue and seasonally lower payments and

deposit service charges, as well as commercial products revenue.
The variance in mortgage banking revenue largely reflected lower origination and sales revenue offset by favorable
variances in the addition to reps and warranty repurchase reserve and mortgage servicing rights valuation.
On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was lower by $216 million, mainly due to the fourth quarter $80 million
settlement expense accrual, lower professional services expense due to the reaching of that settlement, favorable
variances, insurance and litigation items and seasonally lower operating expense offset by higher benefits including
pension and the expense related to low income housing and other tax advantaged projects.
Turning to slide 10, our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the full
impact of the current proposed rules for Basel III standardized approach, we have it estimated that our Basel III Tier 1
common equity ratio was 8.2% at March 31st versus 8.1% at December 31st. At 8.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel
III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.
In March, we received the results of the 2013 comprehensive capital assessment and review, the CCAR, including the
Federal Reserve's non-objection to our capital plan. Subsequently, we announced a new one-year buyback
authorization totaling $2.25 billion effective April 1st and we expect to recommend to the Board of Directors that they
approve an 18% increase in our common stock dividend in the second quarter.
These capital actions will allow us to maintain our goal of returning 60% and 80% of our earnings to our shareholders
in the form of dividends and buybacks in 2013. In the first quarter, we returned 69% of our earnings to shareholders
including dividends and repurchase of 17 million shares of common stock.
Finally, slide 12 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase related expense and the reserve for
expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. The addition to the reps and warranties repurchase reserve
this quarter was $36 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2012. Recall we booked additional reserves in the fourth
quarter to address the put back risk of Freddie Mac loans originated in 2004 and 2005. Our outstanding repurchased
and make-whole request balance at March 31st was $66 million compared with $131 million at December 31st. I'll now
turn the call back to Richard
Richard K. Davis
Thanks Andy. Turning to slide 13, you will see the cover of our 2012 annual report; a rich heritage and a strong future.
And today, we're in Boise, Idaho, the site of our 2013 annual shareholders meeting. I'm looking forward to presenting
our shareholders with a brief look at our past and a view into our future.
Idaho, in fact, is part of our company's rich heritage which began 150 years ago with the signing of our national bank
charter in 1863. The presentation will include the story of how we achieved the size and scale we are today and in
particular what we accomplished in 2012, including record revenue, record earnings and industry-leading performance
metrics against the backdrop of a slowly recovering and uncertain environment.
Even more important, however, to all of our shareholders is that we have positioned U.S. Bank for a strong future, a
future that includes continued investment in our well diversified mix of businesses, prudent risk management, a focus
on operating integrity and compliance, strong capital and liquidity and superior returns for our shareholders. We're
looking forward to the future as we move into 2013 with our first quarter now complete and we remain focused as
always on producing consistent, predictable, repeatable results for the benefit our customers, our employees, our
communities and our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer any questions from the audience.

[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Erika Penala, with Bank of America.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi Erika.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Hey, Richard, your comments on cautious – your cautious loan growth commentary during
the Citi conference really resonated with the investor community so I was wondering if you could give us an update on
your outlook for the balance of the year?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Erika, yeah, much as I wish it were more positive, I think we just need to be realistic
in this environment and while you recall that in quarter four we grew our linked quarter loans 1.4%, we then suggested
a month ago that while we wanted to be in the range of 1% and 1.5% for this most recent quarter, we'd be on the low
end and here we are at 1%.
My guidance for next quarter, which is as far as I can see, is somewhere in between the 1% and 1.5% again, if we get
the seasonal lift that we expect and we normally see in the springtime, then we'll be in the middle of that to high end of
that range. If we see a continued cautious nature by our customers, which we've now seen for the last few months, then
it might be on the low end of that range. But it'll be somewhere in between. So what I'm saying is, it's not going to
robustly coming back on all cylinders and that makes sense to us because there continues to be a withholding by both
consumers and businesses in this uncertain environment, particularly now on the heels on the both higher FICA cost
and what we all know to be some of the slow but eventual sequester impact, the higher gasoline costs and a lack of any
other catalyst for the business community to jump on the need to take action any earlier now with the commitment of
forward interest rates being low for so long.
So longer view, second half of the year, I would hope we start moving into the higher end of the 1% to 2% linked
quarter range but for now, I'm going to say, we're going to be pretty set in that same kind of range bound, 1% to 1.5%
linked quarter until we see some catalyst.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Got it. And my follow-up question would be on the expense side – thank you so much for
the color on looking for a low 50s efficiency ratio. And you also mentioned the word flexible in your prepared remarks.
If we fall into the lower end of the range on loan growth and clearly mortgage banking is a big question mark for the
rest of the year, is the main message here is that there is still flexibility remaining in terms of managing the dollar
number to keep the efficiency ratio in the low 50s no matter what happens to the revenue side for the rest of the year?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. For a couple of reasons, the answer is yes. I'm fairly comfortable that, as you know,
we manage more to operating leverage than we do efficiency ratio and we promised that as this year will be a harder
year for revenue growth, at least at the conservative manner in which we run the company, likewise we're going to be
conservative on expense growth and as long as revenue growth [indiscernible] (16:45) expenses, you know that you
have positive operating leverage and your efficiency ratio gets better.
So, efficiency for us is a result, not a goal, but because of that, I can assure you it will stay in the low 50s. I don't see
any reason for that to be any different than it has for the last many years. I'll also add, you'll recall, that while we are
moving through this consent order and have substantially less costs in compliance for that purpose, we do see the cost
of compliance and operating integrity going up, but well within the range of the amount that we're now going to be able
to redeploy.
So even on a linked quarter basis for a company like ours, while I hated all the money we are spending on the consent
order, now it serves as a backdrop for us to use for some redeployment for what I know to be higher expenses in
compliance and audit going forward. So we have really no reason, and if loan growth were to stay slow, as you know
because of our 50-50 mix of spread income and fee income, as long as the seasonality continues to happen along with
our trust and our payments businesses and some of the non balance sheet items, I also have confidence we can stay in

the low 50s at as an outcome.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep. Thanks, Erika.
Operator
Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning. I realize there's a lot of seasonality and fees quarter-to-quarter and
year-over-year you highlight some of the declines obviously in mortgage and private equity. But I guess just generally
speaking it felt like fees broadly were a little bit weaker year-over-year as we looked at the service charges, the cash
management, corporate areas just some areas that I thought would be grinding higher. I didn't know if there was
anything kind of unusual that just happened – all hit at once or is it just kind of sluggish client activity overall?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Matt this is Andy. So first you're right, the first quarter is seasonally lower across a number
of categories. In addition to the seasonality, I'd highlight two things. One is, in our corporate products – corporate
payments revenue, we have about a 30% exposure to the U.S. government with a high percentage of that related to the
defense department. And government spending is down approximately 15% to 30% depending upon the category. So
that is a driver of our – a principal driver of the lower year-over-year and a little lower linked quarter growth that you
see in corporate payments. So that's going to depend upon what the future is in terms of government spend, but that is
an unusual item that you see there.
The second category, I bring up is our commercial product revenue. We have particular strength in our high-grade bond
underwriting, that's doing very well and you're reading about the marketplace and how a lot of bond issues are
occurring. However, the marketplace is also indicating that FX, loan syndication and some of the more one-time fees
are slowing down a bit because – somewhat because of that high bond underwriting activity. So those are two things in
addition to seasonality that I would call out.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately following up on the net interest income – or sorry the loan
growth outlook as we think about the NIM component from here and the outlook comments on the net interest margin
percent?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes. So I – we had indicated that we would be down 5 to 7. We were down 7. I will tell you
my expectation was, that is the most it will go down this year. My expectation for the second quarter is closer 4 to 6.
Part of the reason for that is first quarter has seasonally lower loan fees and secondly, the compression of what's
coming on versus what's coming off is dissipating. So, you'll see continued improvement throughout the year and
again, second quarter, 4 to 6.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: And then when you combine that with the low single digit or low 1% loan growth, do you
hold net interest income stable or can you get a little growth out of that?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Relatively stable to perhaps a little bit of growth.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: You bet.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks Matt.

Your next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning, guys. Andy, a quick follow up on the net interest margin. Your
margin was very resilient for a lot of the low interest rate environment and last couple of quarters you've had a little
leakage down. What is the dynamic there? Did you have some funding cost ability to push that down and that is starting
to dissipate or can you just give us a little color there?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, John, so that is the reason. In 2012, we had about $12 billion of debt that either
matured and it was not replaced or was replaced at a much lower cost, that helped us particularly the last half of 2012.
In 2013, we have a much lower number of debt coming due. So, we have less of that repricing that will help us.
However, as I said, sort of offsetting that is the difference between what's coming on and off, particularly in the
securities portfolio, will continue to improve each quarter so that will be an offset. But that is the principal dynamic last
year versus this year.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then can you just remind us of your positioning to higher interest rates and
which interest rates matter most for you?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: We're asset sensitive, we continue to be asset sensitive, which you saw in the fourth quarter
Annual Report. It is very similar to what you will see in the first quarter Q. So, we are biased towards positive rates and
the most important part on the curve for us is three years to five years.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then on the credit side, Richard, I guess you – do you envision being able
to run at a below average charge-off rate for a considerable amount of time here, both you and the industry as there
hasn't been much lending and housing is improving. Do you see credit kind of running below average for a while?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I do. And I think we predicted that a year ago that we would all fall below our over the term
rate and it would take years to come back, I mean just the way the math works. The temptation is for certain companies
to decide that now is the time to take maybe a higher level of risk because A, it won't show up for a while and B, the
stress for that asset growth is pretty high and that temptation is present in our company but it isn't going to happen. So,
the fact is that we're going to continue to be prudent and we'll take our hits if you guys don't like the loan growth but
we're not going to put on structurally deficit asset fund to our books for fear of them being a problem in many years
forward, we're just not going to do that.
So, you'll see us be prudent and we're not going to – we are not in the leverage lending business to speak of, so we're
not enjoying that particular run-up right now. We're not going to get into things like enhanced lease residuals or get into
some of the non-interest related activities. But as I always say, we'll continue to fight for our own customers and
continue to build some growth in market share by using our pricing advantage which you all know we have a pretty
substantial one which we can give a part of it back to our best customers and new customers.
I'll also remind that our commitments grew almost 12% year-over-year in annualized linked quarter, 7% and so we're
continuing to enjoy bringing a lot of new customers and they're still sitting at that 25% usage level. But once and when
they start using it, we would hope that whoever has the most customers on their balance sheet with open lines of credit
will be the one that does the best and we're counting on being one of those.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And, while it does sound like you will run below average or over the cycle you don't
see much more improvement from this kind of 79 basis point level? You think it will just hold somewhere in there?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I think we fall through the 70s and we stay in there. And I thought a year – six months ago,
we'd fall to the low 80s.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yeah.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So it got better, faster and probably more sustainably than we'd thought, which is why you
saw some of our actions. But, just because of our large credit card portfolio and the mix of business, it shouldn't get

much lower than that or – then we really allowed too much on the table.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah this is Bill. I mean, the area that still has room for improvement is anything related to the
residential mortgage. So, residential mortgage home equity is still high and over the next year or two, depending on
housing prices, that should continue to come down.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Bill, it looked like the home equity NPLs and charge-offs ticked up a little bit in the
first quarter. Is that a seasonality issue?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah. They will come down again in the second quarter and should be down for the balance of
the year.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, John.

Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: So, on the mortgage banking side a lot of people felt that we have been writing it off for the rest
of the year. What's your views for the gain on sale and volumes throughout the year?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: You know, Paul, I'm going to give you – I don't know the whole year. I'll give you what I
can see in the second quarter and so the first quarter, our fees were down about 15.5% and that's principally because
apps were down. We booked about 80% of our revenue at app and the remainder at close. Apps were down about 20%
and gain on sale margins were down 10 basis points – 15 basis points and the offset was positive servicing revenue and
the margin and the gain on sale or excuse me, the servicing edge. So those are the gives and takes.
What we look – as we look into the second quarter, we believe mortgage revenue will grow, and we believe the
application volumes, what we've seen thus far will increase. So, we think that this first quarter was a little bit seasonal,
a little bit impacted by the blip in rates that occurred in late February. We're starting to see some strength there, so we
expect an increase in mortgage revenue Q2.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And, Paul, we're sticking with mortgage. We like it, and we do it well. We think, as I said
before, that there will be a purchase money future out there we want to have that same market share position, if not
greater with purchase money. So, we continue to prioritize our new customers and make sure that their servicing and
our performance on their on-boarding is exceptional so that they'll be pleased. A refi is also important but it doesn't
have the same time parameters attached to it because you don't have another party involved and we're going to continue
to grow in this business and do what we can to improve the mix of where the originations come from, more retail, if we
can, but at the same time we have a very good variability on our expense control. So, if things were to continue to fall
and be less than we expect, we can adjust to that very quickly, probably within 30 days to 60 days. It's in the way we
staff, and the way we've set up our occupancy cost. So, we're able to flex with it, but we like it and we're going to plan
on it continuing to be strong.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And correct me if I am wrong but I don't think you have a lot of HARP eligible loans. What type
of HARP production are you doing right now?
<A - P. W. Parker>: About 11% is the HARP for us.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Hey guys, thank you very much.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah. Thanks, Paul.

Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Just wondering if you could just expand on the mortgage side, can you talk about how your mix
of originations has changed and market share dynamic changes as you – as Richard, as you talk about that being
prepared for a purchased market?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, first of all from an origination standpoint, if you think about production, about 72% of
the production was refinancing. Only about 62% of the applications, however, were refinancing so again, that increase
in rates that occurred did impact apps and refinancings did go down in the first quarter. We're starting to see it shift
back to more of that 70-30 refinancing and again we expect strength in the application volume into quarter two. Given
– we don't have the full market data yet, but we continue to expect that we will be either stable or slightly increasing in
market share.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay, great. My second question I wanted to ask you about noninterest bearing deposits did
decline on average a decent amount. And I just wanted to ask you to flush that out a little bit how much of that was
seasonal, how much of it is customers behaving differently and any changes with regards to even customers starting to
potentially use some of their deposits instead of borrowing?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. I think a factor there, Ken, was the elimination of tax and what we saw at the end of
the year was a shift perhaps of about $6 billion out of non-interest bearing which had – until yearend had unlimited
insurance into a more interest bearing category. So I think customers thought about it and said I'm going to go after a
few basis points since I don't have unlimited insurance. So I think that's the phenomenon that we saw.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Ken, you make a great point, because I've often said that the canary in the mine is the first
good news for all this industry is the deposits and total moved down because people are using them and they'll use the
lines of credit that they have opened to buy and they're paying for and then eventually they get more loan.
This is not that. This is not that first mover where we're seeing the total deposits moving down as a result of customers
using it for other things, particularly for growth. They're really withholding, they continue to be cautious and they're
just building up the balance sheet. No matter where they place it, they're just kind of moving it about to seek a little
higher yield.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: And Richard, on that point, this will be my last question – can you just talk us through when you
are talking to customers, we continue to hear about this delay in cautiousness. What are customers looking for to make
that change in their minds? Everyone is very flush with cash, companies are strong from a financial perspective, we're
seeing that in credit. But so, we continue to hear about delay, delay, delay. What are customers waiting for?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: That's a great question and it has a lot of answers, but mine would be that it is particularly
the lack of a catalyst. Perhaps, more than it is the uncertainty. Even I'm tired of talking about uncertainty without a very
good definition. We could tie last year to fiscal cliff, we could tie the last quarter to the pending sequester, we can try to
say it's going to be the national debt. It's probably not any of those anymore. There's no reason to take a bite, right now,
of the apple and invest in something that will cost you more with the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not there's
going to be a customer base for you.
So what I would say to you, Ken, is you've got the interest rates being decidedly low for a long time. So, there's no
catalyst for a company to rush to make a decision because rates are eventually going to move up. They probably should

be thinking that way, but based on the calculus and what the Fed has done by tying it to unemployment; everyone can
see that it's not imminent. So, absent that and absent a good deal where you see the M&A market still has some life to
it, most companies are going to continue to just do what they do well, stick to their knitting, be very cautious and be
proud of the fact that they're still being profitable and they are going to wait for a catalyst which I think will be interest
rates eventually starting to move up and people taking advantage of that and/or the consumer getting much stronger and
starting to seek more, purchase consumer products and services and then the company is starting to meet that demand.
None of that's present today. It's not horrible. It's slow recovery. It's tortuously slow but there's no catalyst to jump on
something earlier than you need to. [indiscernible] (31:10). Yeah.

Your next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Good morning. I wonder if I could follow up on this point you made about it's tempting at this
point in the cycle to stretch for growth and maybe people getting to mid and even late cycle underwriting standards in
certain products. You referenced leveraged lending as one. Are there other parts of the market that particularly concern
you and maybe if I could specifically hone in on auto a little bit since you have some slides on it in the back of the
deck?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. I'm going to have Bill answer the hard one. I'll take auto because that's very timely.
We're one of the larger – we're the seventh largest auto lender, so a meaningful 2.3% market share. We're also one of
the larger auto lessors and we've been in that business for as many years as auto leasing has been around. So, we're
good at it. It has a lot of attributes to it like end of term, used market sales, values, all those kinds of things and it would
be one of the opportunities you have is to enhance your residual value. And so if you're going to get a loan from bank X
and they're going to say after a three-year term, your value is going to be X, and you get it from us and we say after a
three-year term your value is going to be, let's say, lower, then you're going to have a higher payment with our
company because we're going to have you take a larger spread. When the car comes back in three, four, five years that's
when we have to meet our maker and decide whether or not we expected the value to be higher or lower and then take
an adjustment well outside of the interest income that would have been derived.
So, it's an example where we just – we've done this business long enough. We are not going to do something any more
than we would take a structural interest – structural credit risk on a customer hoping that they're going to get better
when we don't see the evidence. So auto has a leasing issue that's probably more germane. Let's pause for a minute
though and also look at what happened with the CFPB last week as they're starting to ringfence the discretion at the
pricing level in the auto sales rooms. And you know that the banks are now going to be held accountable for disparate
lending behaviors by auto dealers all through the country as it relates to the kind of upcharges they might provide a
customer or add-on products they might deliver. So, that's all going to be well worth watching in the next 90 days to
see what the banks are going to do.
We immediately responded by ringfencing the amount of latitude we give our dealers. We'll probably lose a little
market share in the beginning but we know that's the end point, so we wanted to adjust quickly. And I think you're
going to find that this starts moving toward a much more probably predictable pricing scheme in auto dealers across the
country and probably margin compression and that may well end up becoming an issue for affordability as the dealers
want to take on some of that profit back in another manner. So, auto lending is really in flux given what just happened.
But, germane to your question, we're simply not going to enhance residuals or take the risk outside of what would
otherwise be credit structure. So, Bill for the other topic.

<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah. I think the other category would be commercial real estate. Historically, banks have liked
commercial real estate because it's actually a pretty easy area to generate instant outstandings. There's always a
developer with a project and seeking money. So that's an area that, over the years, has been subject to too much money
going into too many projects. The way we manage that is we start with our customers and the first thing we do is really
underwrite – understand our customer. It's common that we do not necessarily do every project for our customer base.
We look at the ones that we like. It's been a successful strategy for us for decades. So, that's the commercial real estate,
the other area.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: I wonder as a follow-up if I could almost ask the opposite question. I mean, you've been pretty
good at being countercyclical and maybe extending into products when others are still afraid to do them. And are there
any opportunities that are still out there like that and the specific one I guess I'm getting at is in residential mortgage,
ALT-A has become maybe a dirty word, but at the same time, the whole market's doing 760 average FICOs. You cite
yours at 765 with a weighted average LTV of 64%. Is there an opportunity to do some kind of prime minus business
and is this a good point in the cycle to be thinking about that?
<A - P. W. Parker>: I'd say less than – a little different answer than the prime minus. I mean, we've held a lot of our
underwriting fairly steady there and we have the capability to do home equity up to 90% loan to value. We haven't
changed that in several years. The issue being a lot of people are just not taking advantage of that, getting back to
Richard's comments about sentiment. So, it's available. We use it in some of our piggyback loans, but the volumes are
not just that great. I think it's less us changing our standards and more the market eventually coming back to them as
people get more confidence.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Great, thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Brian.

Your next question comes from Keith Murray with Nomura.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Just ask you a question – you talked about loan growth. Are you seeing the ability to take
share and which particular loan categories are you seeing it?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: This is Richard. Small business, for sure. Five years ago, we started a trip to become a really
high quality small business originator and we did it to our branch managers, and you're welcome to call any of them, all
3,100 of them. Their job is to be a community leader and know that whole neighborhood like it was a small little town
and part of that goes along with being the bank for the small business owners in and around that location.
So, we've been taking market share that continues to be one of our strongest growth, both in, what you call, traditional
small business, as well as SBA lending. We're the second largest SBA lender at national level at this point as well. So
we see a lot of value in being good at that and it is the real execution game. It's not so much just pricing and product.
It's knowing your customer and giving them what they need.
The other thing that I would say is that we're continuing to focus on in terms of market share grab would be second –
first position second mortgages. We've been very, very successful at that and it's for a lot of people, it's a way to get
into the equity without having to go through the typical steps you would have to go for first position, traditional
mortgage. They're very high quality customers. They like the product, they like the access and in particular they don't
want to do another credit card. They still feel comfortable using the equity in their home and those have been two really
growth businesses for us. Bill, [indiscernible] (38:05)?

<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah. I think the other big area is really our corporate bank and especially their inroads into the
investment grade space, whether that's through commitments and taking joint lead or lead positions with a number of
our clients and with that comes the investment grade underwriting that we established in Charlotte. So I'd say that's
another area that's come a long way.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, four years ago – four years ago, Keith, we didn't even really have that and now we're
leading transactions and what comes of that too, Bill, is the fee business..
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Which is part of the quid pro quo, so that will be another good place. So, we feel we've got a
lot of room and space for market share growth in places where we're still getting better at, but I think we also have the
advantage of being ahead of some of the curves on that as that's being played out.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Thanks. And then on the payment side, you mentioned the government spending piece of it
having an impact but what's your growth outlook for that business? A lot of clients ask the question, it looks like
growth has slowed there. Just what's your view on the space?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Let me put it by piece. So, merchant growth is going to be a bit of a function of same-store
sales growth which will range somewhere between 3% and 5% we expect for the rest of the year. We'll go a little bit
above that because we're adding new customers but same-store sales drives that. On the card side, it is going to be
consumer spend and you know, that what we're seeing is spending relatively stable. But, the pay down of the loans
continues to increase, in other words the revolve rate is such that people are paying down their outstanding debt, so that
is what's impacting outstandings. And on the corporate card side, as we said, we have a fair exposure to the government
and T&E both which are weak, for reasons that Richard has gone through. Purchasing – traditional purchasing is
stronger, the T&E and government is a little weaker. So that will depend again – again on the sentiment on a
go-forward basis.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And Keith, I'll add, one of our hidden benefits and it is hidden because it's still growing is
this international growth in our merchant acquiring. You heard that we closed the deal with Santander last week. We've
got this continuing growth in this early stage kind of nascent partnership with Citi down in Brazil. I was in Mexico City
just a couple of weeks ago where we have, you know, 400 employees and we've been working on partnerships with
some of the largest merchants in Mexico and so these are businesses that are fairly young, a few years old but they are
the kind that have the great growth curve so they are moving from red to pink to grey to black in terms of bottom line.
And they have got trajectories of growth and that's probably something you'll hear about in the future quarters which
isn't present in today's run rate.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Good morning. A couple of questions, follow-ups. One, you mentioned earlier the
mortgage origination revenues, 80% at app, 20% at close. Is there – what drives that difference? Is it a function of the
type of loan that you're originating?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: No, you principally book the gain at lock and you book some of the miscellaneous fees at
close.

<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. And then, for your budget when you're looking at one and two years what kind of
interest rate environment are you basing that on?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: The budget that we planned under is very similar to the CCAR base case budget, Betsy,
which is a basically low-rate environment for the next couple of years at the low end with some increase at the longer
end towards the end of this year into next year.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. So is it fair to say it's in line with what the FOMC is suggesting they're going to
do with rates?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes. It's very close to the Blue Chip consensus.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay, and then lastly on payment space, so obviously there's a lot going on in the
payments industry right now. And just wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about positioning USB
longer term, specifically around some of the payment strategies in the U.S., you know that JPM and Visa have signed
into a unique partnership. Is there anything that in that make – would make sense for USB? Obviously you've got your
own merchant acquirer so wanted to see what your thoughts are there.
And then separately in non-U.S., you've been increasing your footprints pretty significantly in the merchant acquiring,
is there any more that you could do there and then lastly, on the Internet space, what kind of options do you have to
increase your share of wallet?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Great. This is Richard. I was going to say payments can now mask either cards or mobile
banking, right? So we'll take those separately. On the traditional payment space, we too have relationships with
partners that we just are working on. We don't necessarily announce them. So you can read between those lines but by
the way it's not exclusive what you mentioned with the other bank. So we are in R&D mode in significant way with all
types of ways to use our acquiring partnership with merchants and in some cases directly to consumer, [indiscernible]
(43:25) and some of those things that you've read about.
So we're not left out of anything. Nothing has come across our desk that we wish we had been a part of and we're just
more likely to announce it once it's been tested and out as opposed to the fact that we're going to test it. So just, you
know, trust us; we have a different cycle than the one which we announce that. As it relates to international, once we
get this beachhead down in Brazil, there's a lot of good growth in South America and if our reputation builds like I
believe it will as a partnership with Citi, where they have a great deal of relationship, we'd expect to see us moving
through South America rather like we did moving from West to East across Pan-Europe and then eventually further
along, perhaps down into the Pacific Rim. We're more careful in Asia Pacific because we're not exactly sure of the
politics in some of those environments, but like anywhere else, you know, our entire story has always been built on the
partnership of another bank that's local to that market and we work with them to become their preferred merchant
provider. It's usually a rent-to-own kind of a relationship and we bring our international platform that we built years
ago and bring it to any country and flip it on and we start doing business.
So there's really very few parts of the world I would say we're not interested in, but we're going to be careful because of
the politics that go along with doing business in countries that we may not have the experience and the partner is going
to be more important probably than the country itself.
And then as it relates to just mobile payments we're spending an inordinate amount of time and energy on that as well,
both keeping ourselves open for all channel options and for all partner options, which in many cases are mobile
providers and some of these less-known brands that are being built in garages across the country. So we're spending an
inordinate amount of time on that and you'll see some of our M&A will very likely be the continuation of traditional
merchant acquiring but I will bet you're going to see some purchases of some less-known capabilities and technologies
as it relates to the channel of moving money in non-traditional ways, particularly through mobile. So more of that will
come, but you'll hear about it in our case after it's working, not the announcement of the idea.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: And then on the mobile side, that would be something that you could then provide to
other financial institutions that you are running their payments business for?

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Excellent point. So we will, as a correspondent bank is to smaller banks, we've been that in
the merchant acquiring space forever where many of the regional banks, smaller banks use us to be their merchant
acquirer under a private label. We'll do exactly the same thing with mobile technology. We'll build it, we'll brand it,
we'll white-label it, we'll sell it to them and they can have the benefit. We'll also get the markup.

Your next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski>: Good morning. I hear what you say about consumer confidence and people not
wanting to lever up. But I guess I always kind of viewed that loan growth and especially consumer loan growth kind of
should go with nominal GDP and, you know, you see auto sales up 40% off the bottom and while you were speaking
housing starts hit the tape. It was over a million units for the first time in a couple of years, and 2X off what it was on
the bottom. And you think about all the furniture and rugs and all this stuff that goes with housing starts.
And just how can it not translate into loan growth? And I'm wondering, is it purely consumer behavior, or is it some of
the new strictures that are on you? Is it like the inability to raise card limits and so on? I just – how does all this other
activity, this [indiscernible] (47:08) activity not translate into loans?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, Chris. Those are all good questions and we consider them all the time, too. First of all
let's talk about auto loans. Auto loans are probably the squeeze play between the lack of equity in homes and the lack of
people's willingness to extend their unsecured credit card any further. So it used to be a home equity would mask a
great deal of the auto purchasing and even credit cards would end up allowing people to feel more comfortable that
they had other alternatives to pull on. People are paying down their credit card more than they're using it and people's
equity while it probably is starting to warm up, isn't been that good that long for them to be comfortable. So it makes
sense to me that autos are probably the single and exclusive space of strength in the consumer side. That's how I've put
it into my head at least.
So as it relates to kind of the next step, you've got the consumer is like a small business, like a large corporation. They
figured out that they can be better with their budget than they thought they could. They can find out they can live on
less than they thought they could and they do not want to get once burnt, twice shy. And so the behaviors are
reasonable but they're more emotional than they are practical or financial. And I think this will eventually recover as
people feel more comfortable. They now know what their cost is going to be in their paycheck every two weeks now
that FICO has been changed.
They're probably getting a better sense of what is going to happen in terms of the cost of gasoline as we move into the
summer months and they start looking whether or not they've got money for vacation. This is the perfect time of the
year where we're in flux to figure out where things are going to settle and in our company April and May pretty much
tell us the rest of the year.
We don't trust the first quarter for a lot of reasons. I don't go – have to go much past May to know how the year is
going to go, but we're right on the heels of figuring out what the consumer behavior will be and I'll tell you it's probably
going to be cautious because for the same reasons I mentioned for corporates. There is no catalyst except for to be
careful and protect yourself given the uncertainty of what things could happen.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski>: So your view is it's purely behavioral. It's not the new regulations and structure and...?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Oh, yeah, thank you. For our company, it's not the latter. We are not bound by capital, by
regulators, by any enforcement actions. We're simply doing the business we think is safe, sound and repeatable and so

far that's been aligned with what the regulators would expect.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. And I'll also point out the – I mean the housing start statistic is heavily weighted now
with multifamily starts. So the single family I see is actually down and so when you talk about consumer sentiment I
mean it's – yes, you build an apartment building, you need carpet, but what you're talking about is the consumer going
out and, you know, buying a new home and refurnishing it, et cetera, and that's a different behavior and that's still fairly
tepid.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski>: All right. That's it for me. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Dan Werner with Morningstar.
<Q - Dan Werner>: Hi. I apologize if I got on the call late. With regard to the allowance of loan losses and given that
you are improving asset quality and you've been provisioning slightly less than what you are charging off, where do
you see the loan loss reserve long-term?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Well, I'm not going to comment long-term, but you know -
<Q - Dan Werner>: Or at least for the rest of the year.
[indiscernible] (50:25)
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Usually we go a quarter at a time. But in general terms, there's still a little more room for
improvement in the credit profile. There's still – wholesale is almost back to what I'd call pre-recession levels, but
there's still a few things to work out so that'll give us a little more relief on the allowance, but it's basically similar to
what it's been doing.
<Q - Dan Werner>: Okay. All right, thank you.

Your next question comes from Todd Hagerman with Sterne, Agee.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Todd.
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: Good morning, everybody. Andy, a couple of questions, just some follow-up. First, in
terms of kind of you were mentioning on the spread out, it looked kind of stable to maybe some growth. What I'm
curious about is how we should think about the earning asset mix with the balance sheet. Obviously, it's been growing
and one of the things that stands out is really the growth in mortgage held on balance sheet and this quarter, we saw a
bit of a drop-off in terms of held for sale. So I'm just wondering how to think about kind of the ongoing mortgage retain
on balance sheet, how you think about give – perhaps the fee income versus the spread component, in conjunction with
your comments on spread?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So there are a few questions in there. First, let me make it clear that a qualifying
mortgage is Freddie/Fannie, we are not holding our balance sheet other than held for sale. So we are selling those.
What you're seeing in terms of mortgage, traditional loans on the balance sheet is our first – our Smart Refinance
product which is that branch-based mortgage originated high-quality customer, that is not a Freddie/Fannie product.
That's what you're seeing growing. We would expect continued growth there for the reasons we've talked about. In
terms of I want to be also clear, net interest income, we expect to be relatively stable to some growth. We do still see

some expectation for that 4 basis point to 6 basis point decline [indiscernible] (52:15) offset by the earning asset growth
and finally, I would say that I expect loan and securities growth to sort of be in sync. So we've stopped in terms of the
build on the securities portfolio and it'll grow in conjunction with overall balance sheet growth.
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: Okay, that's very – that's really helpful. And then just, you know, switching gears a little
bit, in terms of again like the mortgage outlook if you will, but in particular on the reps and warranties, you guys had a
nice drop-off this quarter in terms of the associated costs on the re-purchase risk as well as on the legal side as well. I
was just wondering how we should think about the provisions, if you will, on a go-forward basis. Is that more in sync
with current production levels? Are we going to see more of a drop-off and decline in the reserve or how should we
think about that?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So as you recall, in the fourth quarter, we increased our reserve principally due to the
lookback period on Freddie Mac going back a couple of more years, so that was unusually high. The first quarter may
be a little bit low because of timing on some of the work-through of that additional lookback period. But I do expect
that to sort of be stable to down in future quarters. So I think we've reached the peak there in terms of the addition to
reserve and we'll start to see it come down.
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: Okay. And then similarly, I don't know if the question was addressed before, but just in
terms of litigation, again, relative to some of your bigger peers, the legal, while it's difficult to predict, if you will, it
seems like we might be at a better or kind of more stable run rate, if you will, in terms of how we think about the legal
going forward in terms of in your existing accruals.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: There is no unusual legal accruals in the first quarter. As you recall, the fourth quarter had
the $80 million but first quarter was relatively straightforward.
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: Okay, so first quarter looks like more of like consistent in terms of the outlook.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, nothing unusual from a litigation reserve standpoint.
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: Okay, great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Compass Point.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Kevin.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: You had 15% markup in the MSR this quarter and the MSR looks like it's valued at about
7.7% of total Tier 1 common equity per Basel III. Could you just talk about how you expect to manage that if the MSR
continues to mark up if we have an increase in rates here?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. So you're talking about the potential impact to a reduction in capital?
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Yes.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. So we have plenty of room there, so part of the reason for the increase in the value is
the increase in rates that we talked about but from an overall standpoint, we could almost double our securities – or our
MSR book and still not have the, the haircut from a Basel III perspective. So we are not bound by that. We continue to
expect to grow the mortgage business as we talked about and again, as we talked about, we expect that to grow more in
the second quarter relative to the first quarter because of the seasonality. But we're not bound by MSR in capital.

<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Is it – is part of that due to deferred tax liabilities associated with that?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: There's a lot of different calculations, but that is not a binding constraint right now.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Okay. And then also, you had 11% of your loans were HARP which is similar to what
you had in the last couple of quarters. Was the reason why the HARP by – HARP mix continues to stay elevated due to
cross – you're doing cross-servicer refis or is it just your own book where you're doing HARP loans?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: It's primarily our own book.

Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio with KBW.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Good morning, Richard and Andy. How are you?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Chris, good, thanks.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Andy, I want to make sure I wrote down a couple of things right. Did you say the gain on
sale was down only 15 basis points because I'm coming out with a much bigger hit to the gain on sale margin this
quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, and you know what the reason for that, and I know, Chris, where you're coming from.
So the reason for that is you're calculating it on production which is what we're putting in our reports and I'm doing it
on net apps after fallout expectations.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay. I just wanted to make sure – so, apps.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right, so production outlooks are flattish. Apps are down close to about 20%. So if you go
through the math on that, you'll see the gain on sale margins down 10 basis points or 20 basis points.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay. That explains the difference fromwhat I was doing. But staying with mortgage for a
quick second, you mentioned that 2Q could be up over 1Q in terms of mortgage banking income. There's kind of four
puts and takes in mortgage, there's production volume and your gain on sale margin, I guess servicing and your rep and
warranty expense. Of those four little subsets, which one is going to be better than first quarter in order to drive an
upward pressure in mortgage banking first to second?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Application volume.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: The others might be better too, but the application volume is going to be the key driver.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Is that just because of seasonality?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Principally seasonality and principally because of that slowdown of the curve with the
increase in rates in the middle of the first quarter.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay. And you're pretty confident in this?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I tell you what I know.

Your next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: I have a capital question for you, Richard. I mean, the big discussion if you want to put it
that way today is the proper level of capital for the systemic banks and this whole [indiscernible] (57:37) and is it going
to be 10%, it is going to be 15%, whatever. I think we're all sort of coming to the conclusion that the largest banks are
probably going to have to have more capital even than Basel dictates.
So do you see this as a competitive advantage for you, or do you think that these demands for higher capital will then
trickle down to the next tier of large banks in which you and a number of the other large regionals reside?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Nancy, good question. First of all, we're just a little tiny bank from Wilmington and I want to
make sure you all know that. I'm convinced that there will be a ratability here. There will be a sliding scale. Even if it
doesn't look like it at first. If you recall the [ph] GSIF or the GSIB (58:24) requirements, we were the first bank not to
be given one, but we weren't comfortable to have zero as a buffer in our minimum capital charge. We just knew it
couldn't be zero but we were not given a number, so we picked 50 basis points. I think that this whole too big to fail
issue has been, we have failed as an industry to provide confidence to the people who worry the most that we really
have ringfenced this problem by six ways to Sunday and as a bank that might otherwise look like an advantaged bank
because we're not typically in that first conversation, we're going to be affected by it in some manner as well, and I
believe for the good of this country, we need to have banks larger than us and we need to have banks smaller than us.
But we are preparing to be part of something and we think we'll get our pro-rata share.
I don't think it will be excessive but I don't think it will be advantageous either. I think we'll get our fair measure of
whatever the rule is here to try to make banks safer and if capital is the measure, so be it. If it's loan losses it might be
that. It might be a liquidity ratio. It could be all kinds of things. I'm worried that too big to fail is just introducing the
idea that we need so many different ways to protect the banks that we'll become so risk-free that we'll end up losing our
benefits to those of you who invest in us. So that's a bigger worry, but I think we'll get whatever is fair and assigned to
us based on our size and our complexity. I don't see it as an advantage or a disadvantage. I think the whole thing though
is a disappointment because we should do a better job of convincing people who are worried that we really have this
ringfenced.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Do you think that the concept of risk-weighted assets is going to still be with us or are we
going to go back to just assets?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Nancy, this is Andy. I think we'll still have risk-weighted assets and maybe a tangible ratio
will come into play in addition. One of the things I want to highlight in our bank, our risk-weighted asset, Basel III, to
our total GAAP asset is about 87%. So we're not – we don't have a huge discount on the risk weightings that you're
reading about in some others. So it may come into play, but it won't be a big deal for us.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: All right, thank you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: You bet.

Our final question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Moshe.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Hi, thanks. Back on the payments, I guess, looking at least through the first two months of
the year, Visa had had – kind of talked about their volume and in U.S. credit and your consumer business seems to be
somewhat slower. I know you mentioned T&E being somewhat slower, but are there any other things going on and
kind of got a follow-up on the partnership thing that you had mentioned?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Moshe, on the merchant side our portfolio is heavily weighted toward resorts, airlines,
hoteliers, not retail. And those are areas that are typically very slow in the first quarter. They always are and they're
even slower right now based on the T&E spend of some of the corporations. So that's why we might be slightly
disturbed because we're not as heavy on retail as the averages you would hear from MasterCard or Visa.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Okay. And you mentioned kind of talking to Visa about potential partnerships, but waiting
until they're a little more clearly defined. What's your view as to what that could accomplish?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Well, I won't talk to any one specific deal but the goal that everyone is trying to figure out is
who is going to carve out what space as it relates to the interlopers that are not financial institutions in moving money
for people in nontraditional ways. I should write that down because that was a long sentence.
But the fact of the matter is that's what we're trying to do. When you're a merchant acquirer, you're the only group that
has a shot at it and if you blow it, then you're going to have an interloper come in and take a position that we've
otherwise had as one of the people – trusted parties in a transaction between consumers and merchants.
So that's really where this is at for us. That's why I tell you we're dealing with many partners. We're dancing with a lot
of different folks. We can do all kinds of different dances if we need to, but we're not leaving ourselves out of the
conversation. We're in virtually every one to decide what we think is a surviving technology or the surviving partner or
the surviving customer behavior and it's changing pretty quickly so all you should know from us is that we're not
waiting and going to be left standing by ourselves. We're out trying all kinds of different things. I just think it's a more
prudent approach to deliver on things and show you even pilots before we announce partnerships. You can just trust me
on this call. We're partnering with everybody you would want us to to make sure we're not leaving out the advantage
that accrues to a 30-year merchant acquirer who is already in this space and does it very well and everybody wants to
be a partner with.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Got you. One last follow-up and that is, you did mention M&A and it's interesting because
after a couple of years in which Visa, MasterCard, American Express have been making a lot of acquisitions and there
had been a lot of acquisitions in the space, it kind of died out. Can you talk a little bit about what you might be thinking
about in terms of relative size of transactions because you sounded like, you know, there's stuff going on?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. It wouldn't be very big. I think I'd try to mention it would be names you haven't heard
of and people who put it together in a garage two years ago. It's the technology, intellectual property we would like to
buy. We're big enough that we can bring it in-house and we can manage things and do them ourselves but on kind of a
nascent technology that we think starts to work is better brought in-house. We can then own it – probably bring them in
with us and have them help us to derive some of that but we're better off to buy their idea enough to try to create a
laboratory where we have everyone trying to come up with something new and there are people out there doing that
today. It will not be names that you're going to be looking at today in the paper. They're not going to be big transactions
that would cause you to change the sense of balance of how we make our money.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep.
