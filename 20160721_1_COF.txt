Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Jeff, and good evening everyone, I want to begin this evening by welcoming Scott Blackley. In May, we
announced that Steve Crawford was appointed to the role of Head of Finance and Corporate Development and that
Scott was appointed to CFO, reporting to Steve. This is Scott's first earnings call as the CFO, and he will continue to be
a key leader in our investor communications.
Scott brings tremendous experience, expertise and insight to Capital One. He has been our Controller since March 2011
and our Principal Accounting Officer since July 2011. Prior to joining Capital One, Scott held various executive
positions at Fannie Mae, and he has more than 20 years of experience in consulting and public accounting including an
appointment to the SEC as a professional accounting fellow and as a partner with KPMG.
And, now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Richard Scott Blackley
Thanks, Rich. I will begin tonight with slide three. Capital One earned $942 million, or $1.69 per share, in the second
quarter. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $1.76. Adjusting items in the quarter included a
$54-million build in our U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve, which was partially offset by a
gain on sale of our interest in Visa Europe of $24 million.
A slide outlining adjusting items can be found on page 11 of the slide deck. Pre-provision earnings decreased 1% on a
linked quarter basis, as higher revenues were offset by higher non-interest expenses. Provision for credit losses
increased 4% on a linked quarter basis, as modestly lower charge-offs were more than offset by a higher linked quarter
allowance build.
We have provided an allowance roll-forward by segment, which you can see on table eight of our earnings supplement.
Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our domestic card business,
we built $290 million of allowance in the quarter. Two factors drove that increase – balance growth in the quarter and
our expectation of rising charge-offs associated with growth math. Our allowance covers 12 months of losses. So as we
continue to move through 2016, we are picking up more of the loss increases that we are projecting into 2017. And as
we have been saying, based on the credit guidance we have today, we expect allowance builds to continue.
Allowance in our Consumer Banking segment increased $58 million in the quarter. This increase was attributable to
our auto business where we built allowance for new originations that included a higher portion of subprime, and we
expect that auto auction prices will decline from current levels.
Lastly, we had a net $50-million build in reserves in our Commercial Banking segment. We built allowance in the
quarter to address increased risks in our taxi medallion lending business, particularly in Chicago, where we have
around a $100-million portfolio, and taxi medallion trading values decreased by about 60% in the quarter.
In our Oil and Gas Portfolio, our allowance for the quarter was essentially flat. But we released $57 million of reserves
for unfunded commitments coming out of the spring redetermination process.

Turning to slide four, you can see that reported NIM decreased 2 basis points from the first quarter to 6.7%, primarily
driven by lower yields on investment securities. Net interest margin increased 17 basis points year-over-year fueled by
strong growth in our Domestic Card business.
Turning to slide five, I will discuss capital. Our 2016 CCAR results demonstrate our continued commitment to return
capital to shareholders. As previously announced, following the approval of our 2016 CCAR capital plan, our board
authorized repurchases of up to 2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.9%, which reflects current phase-ins.
On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.8%, and we reduced our net share count by 8.6 million shares in the
quarter.
As we continue our parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches, we estimate our common equity Tier 1 capital
ratio remains above our 8% target. Given existing and likely changes coming in capital regulations, we no longer
believe that Advanced Approaches will be our long-term constraint. Accordingly, until we exit parallel run for
Advanced Approaches, we plan to only report our standardized approach common equity Tier 1 capital ratio.
Before I turn the call over to Rich, I want to call out that in the third quarter we expect a one-time Rewards expense
that will reduce net interchange income by approximately $45 million to $55 million. Our Rewards liability has been
measured on a slight lag to quarter. In the third quarter, we expect to complete some system enhancements that will
move the Rewards liability cutoff to the last day of the quarter, resulting in a one-time increase in Rewards costs in the
third quarter.
With that I will turn the call over to Rich.
Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Scott. I'll begin tonight on slide seven with our Domestic Card business. Growth of loans and purchase volume
remained strong, although growth decelerated modestly. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans
grew $9.6 billion, or about 12%. Average loans were up $10.1 billion, or about 13%, second quarter purchase volume
increased about 14% from the prior year.
Competition is picking up across the domestic credit card market from the Rewards space to subprimes. Over time, this
can have impact on the growth opportunity and even credit quality in the business. While we always watch vigilantly
for these effects, we continue to find attractive growth opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focusing on
for some time.
Revenue for the quarter increased 12% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue
margin declined modestly with our exit of the back book of payment protection products at the end of the first quarter.
Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%. Non-interest expense increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter, with
higher marketing and growth related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.
Net interchange revenue for the total company increased 9% from the prior year quarter versus the 14% growth in
domestic card purchase volume. As we discussed, there is considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between
these two metrics. For the past several years on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below domestic
card purchase volume growth. We would expect this difference to continue as we originate new rewards customers in
our flagship products and extend rewards to existing customers.
Additionally, a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks. These deals are
putting pressure on interchange revenue, and we expect the pressure to continue. As we've discussed for several
quarters, two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations: The first is growth math, which is the
upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our
overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. Growth math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the second
quarter of last year, and seasonality drove the improvement in charge-off rate compared to the length quarter.

Our guidance for domestic card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from growth math
will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be
around 4% with quarterly seasonable variability. And while it's still 18 months in the future, based on what we see
today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still
expect full-year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4%s, with quarterly seasonal variability.
Our Domestic Card business delivered strong growth and returns in the second quarter, and we really liked the business
we're booking. While we continue to closely watch the marketplace, we still see attractive growth opportunities in our
Domestic Card business.
Slide eight summarizes second quarter results for the Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were essentially flat
compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up
about $6 billion versus the prior year. Second quarter auto originations were $6.5 billion, about 20% higher compared
to the second quarter of last year.
Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we liked the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business we're booking
and continue to believe that the through-the-cycle economics of our auto business are attractive. Sustained success in
the auto business requires active management of competitive cycles rather than aiming for arbitrary growth or market
share targets.
Immediately after the Great Recession, we had a unique opportunity in auto that we vigorously pursued. Gradually, as
competition intensified, some subprime players adopted more aggressive underwriting practices that we chose not to
follow. As a result, our subprime originations stayed essentially flat for a few years before shrinking in 2015, despite
growth in the subprime market.
Our prime originations continued to grow during this period. In the first half of 2016, these competitive practices seem
to have subsided somewhat, which enabled us to grow our subprime originations. Even though we've had two quarters
of stronger growth, the auto market and competitor practices remain dynamic. While we see opportunities for growth,
we remain very vigilant about competitor practices.
Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient originations. And we continue
to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-offs as the cycle plays out.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter decreased modestly from the second quarter of last year. Higher revenue
from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of
mortgage balances. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 1% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by
growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing.
As we mentioned last quarter, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the
evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In the second quarter, actual charges related to branch moves
were about $35 million. Year-to-date, we've recognized about $45 million of the $160 million in expected costs for
2016. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the Consumer Bank segment.
Second quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily driven by additions to the allowance for
loan losses for the auto portfolio, which Scott described. For several quarters we've said that we expect pressure on our
Consumer Banking financial results. We expect the pressure to become more visible in Consumer Banking quarterly
results in the second half of the year.
In the home loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. It auto finance, margins are decreasing, and
charge-offs are rising modestly. And our deposit business continues to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We
expect that these factors will negatively affect consumer banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income even as we
continue to tightly manage cost.
Moving to slide nine, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances increased
29% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of
loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 13% over the same time period. Average loans increased 27%

year-over-year, while average deposits increased 3%. Revenue was up 17% from the second quarter of 2015.
Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses
increased $79 million from the prior year quarter to $128 million as we continued to build reserves. We've been
building reserves over the last six quarters to reflect increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans. Criticized
and non-performing loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter.
The Commercial Bank criticized loan rate was 5.3% in the second quarter, comprised of the criticized performing loan
rate of 3.7% and the criticized non-performing loan rate of 1.6%. We continue to focus on managing credit risk and
working with our oil and gas customers.
As you can see on slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the second quarter at $3.0 billion or about 1.3% of total
company loans. Unfunded exposure decreased to $2.7 billion. We had a net release from the reserves allocated to the
Oil and Gas Portfolio, driven by reductions in our unfunded exposures following the spring redetermination process.
But we still expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges. At quarter end approximately $265 million
of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our Oil and Gas Portfolio. This
allowance is about 8.9% of total oil and gas loans. Including unfunded reserves, plus allowance, we held $310 million
in total reserves allocated to the Oil and Gas Portfolio.
I will close this evening with some thoughts on second-quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another
quarter of strong growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes, as well as growth in auto and
commercial loans driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense,
marketing and allowance for loan losses.
Non-interest expense increased modestly from the linked quarter, but second-quarter non-interest expense remains
below our expected run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons. Our businesses continue to grow,
we expect about $115 million in branch optimization costs to impact the remainder of 2016. And we expect higher
FDIC expenses in the second half of 2016.
Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full-year
2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017 excluding adjusting items. We plan to deliver efficiency
improvement despite pressure from elevated branch optimization costs, higher FDIC expenses and recent deterioration
in market expectations for interest rates. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time,
and we continue to tightly manage costs across our businesses.
The 2016 CCAR process concluded in the quarter. The Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan. So we expect
to maintain our dividend and repurchase $2.5 billion of stock over the next four quarters. Pulling up, we continue to be
in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end
of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.
And, now, Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. A couple of questions. One is on the reserve. I just wanted to understand when
during the quarter do you make the decision to do the reserve top-up? And this is something that's looking forward just
on a four quarter basis, or is this on more of a two-year basis and eight-quarter basis?
<A - Richard Scott Blackley>: Yeah. Hey, Betsy. It's Scott. Thanks for the question. Let me just reiterate that for our
consumer-facing businesses, there is kind of three parts that impact the allowance. The first is that we take the
outstandings as of the end of the period. The second is that we look at our loss expectations for the next 12 months.
And then we also have qualitative factors to account for some of non-modeled risks.
In this quarter, we had $4 billion of growth. We increased the losses in our allowance window, which is totally
consistent with what we've been signaling in our guidance for rising charge-offs. And of course, as we do every
quarter, we true up qualitative factors. So those were really the factors – the same process that we do each quarter for
the allowance.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Second question is just on the interchange. You talked about pressure on the
interchange coming from some specific deals that large merchants are doing with the networks. And I think, Rich, you
mentioned this on prior calls, just wanted to get a sense as to, is this an acceleration here, and it does – is it large
enough for you to consider or think about changing how your Rewards are structured?
<A - Richard Scott Blackley>: Betsy, it's the same phenomenon with pretty much the same merchants that I talked
about in the past, so these are big merchants, and therefore it – you can see the – you'll see the effects on our metrics as
this rolls through. Some of it is in there, and some is rolling into the numbers. But it is not – it will not necessitate a
change in the – in anything about our strategy of going after the Rewards business and our – continue to believe in the
growth opportunity in that business.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
And next we'll hear from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hey. Good evening, Rich, good evening, Scott. Rich, maybe if I could start off with a question
on credit. We've now had 13 months of double-digit loan growth in the U.S. You're reiterating the guidance on
charge-offs of 4% and low-4%s next year. You noted the impact of growth math will decelerate. So I'm just trying to
understand. If, let's just say, loan growth would remain steady or even decelerate from here, given the way that the
book seasons, how far out is it going to take for charge-offs to peak? And then related to that, when would you actually
expect provisions from growth math to actually peak?
<A - Richard Scott Blackley>: Hey, Ryan, look, I'm reluctant to predict peaks per se. We like to explain very much
the mechanics of how things work. Growth math which on the way up and as growth is increasing, growth math works
one way. And then, slowing growth if – in some ways works the other way. That would impact provision expenses
directly by reducing the allowance builds driven by loan growth.
And over time slower growth could also reduce the pace of growth math related to Card's overall loss rate, by
accelerating the point at which the natural seasoning of older growth offsets the growth math effects of newer growth.
But a lot depends really on the magnitude and mix of the remaining growth.
So we are growing at a pretty rapid pace now, so even if loan growth slows a bit from here, it is still quite a bit of
growth relative to the highly seasoned back book. So you're right about the math. I am reluctant to pick a peak here
because there are a lot of factors involved, but I think that everyone should understand you know, the way growth math
works and the way it works as growth accelerates and as growth is big, and then it tends to be a good guy, as it works
through on the other side. But those effects can, the growth math of a particular vintage has most of its impact over the
two years following that, and then there is really a seasoning from there, and so this is really just the net seasoning math
of all the different vintages and the size of those.

<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. And maybe if I could just do one unrelated follow-up, Rich, very healthy quarter for
growth in auto. You said that you are still seeing some competitive pressures. Maybe can you just expand a little bit on
those comments, what you're seeing competitively? And one of the regional banks Huntington talked about the
sensitivity to a fall in, in the Manheim, they said if the Manheim fell to 100 they would see charge-offs go in auto from
20% to 30%. Can you maybe just talk quantitatively or qualitatively about how you would expect the sensitivity to
charge-offs to falling Manheim?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes, so, look, we always – as credit people, we are always worriers, right. And so we
have – the auto business is a classic business that I mean, we really like the business, but we need to have our eyes very
wide open about where we are in the credit cycle, which may or may not be the very same thing as in the economic
cycle, and we have to act accordingly.
So at the top of our worry list, is underwriting practices. Because that not only affects volumes as we pull back, but it
also can so quickly make its way into credit quality and not only for those – doing those practices but it can have ripple
effects on the industry. So at the top of our list of concern has been competitor practices, and we have flagged,
particularly in the subprime area, some concern about that. That, as I mentioned is actually looks like it's mitigating
somewhat. I don't want to declare victory on that, but that's a positive here. We'll keep an eye on that.
The next thing is just the amount of supply out there. And from the amazingly low levels of supply a few years ago,
this has been a very natural return to more and more supply in the industry. And you can see every year there is a little
bit more of – out there and more competition. And that's why over time margins have gone down. So far we feel good
that some of the most critical things like LTV have stayed – haven't gotten affected yet. A lot of the pricing – a lot of
the impact has been more on the pricing that affects margins.
And then – so that's kind of the competitive side of it. And then as we mentioned for quite a long time, we've got to
remember the collateral value side of this thing. And the fact that used car prices have been at record levels for a long
time is certainly a matter of concern. And we said pretty much there is only one way for them to go from here.
Now, interestingly, if you look at the Manheim Index, that is pretty flat – maybe ticking down a little bit. We have our
own recovery index on our own business, and that has been actually declining really for the last couple of years, which
– an interesting point. Well, why would our recovery index be disconnected a little bit from the Manheim Index? I
think that is – that's a little bit more about our mix is a little different from Manheim's mix. The Manheim mix has a
higher proportion of larger vehicles, they have been increasing in price. Lately, prices for smaller vehicles have been
declining. And on a relative basis, we have more of a mix of smaller cars and fewer trucks basically than the Manheim
Index overall. So I think we see more of that effect than the industry does.
But the main point is, I think, the only way from here is down. We underwrite to an assumption that this thing is
coming down right away. How it actually plays out, we'll have to see. I don't think we've got any scenario modeling
quantitatively to share with you. But I think you're focusing on the right concerns in the business.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
And our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Rich, just to follow up on Ryan's question. It sounded like some of the
provision increase in auto had to do with some higher anticipated severity. But is there anything that you're seeing that
caused you to think that there's going to be a change in the frequency of default in auto?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: No, I think that our outlook will – frankly, relative to last quarter, probably a little more
bullish, just more locally bullish about the auto business because of the little mitigation that's going on in the
competitive environment of subprime.

But I think the way to think about the auto business is that off of the once-in-a-lifetime levels from some years ago
there is a gradual normalization that's very much kind of how the market works, and I think that we see that going on,
but we don't see – we don't see indicators that would suggest that there's some turn in the business. And we talked
about the used-car issues we're keeping an eye on. But other than that I think more this is us worrying as opposed to
reporting some real degradation in the business.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks. And if I can just follow up on the optimization costs, can you just remind me what
the full year figure is? And where will we see kind of the benefits of that manifested in the income statement?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: When you say optimization you're talking about the branch restructuring costs?
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Correct.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. Well, you'll see the – obviously, the charges will be broken out in the other area,
but they'll be spread throughout the income statement, and they'll obviously be recognized over time. We're not – and
it's – we've already recognized about $40 million of the $160 million, so that means we have another $80 million to go
in the second half.
<A - Richard Scott Blackley>: You think about – if you think about this quarter, a good portion of the total charges
ran through our occupancy and equipment line item, which really reflected some accelerated depreciation and some
additional costs associated with closures.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: So it's $160 million total, so $40 million in the first half.
<A - Richard Scott Blackley>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: The run rate will be up $80 million versus the first half so it will be about $120 million.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

And next we have Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think that in a lot of ways the dispositive factor
for Capital One over the next 18 months is going to be given the ramp up in card charge-offs, the stabilization that you
point to in 2017. What I am trying to understand is given – and I think this sort of gets back to Ryan's question as well,
given that you are still in a high-growth mode at least through the first half of 2016, why aren't we going to see the
impact of growth math impact charge-offs in 2017? What gives you confidence that it's going to start to flatten out?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I want to be perfectly clear that the business we're booking this year absolutely impacts
the 2017 numbers and growth math plays out over a multi-year period. So I want to be perfectly clear, we are
continuing to book a lot of business here, and these vintages then have to work their way through, and they tend to over
the first couple of years reach their peak and then moderate from there. So, I mean, in fact, you can see our guidance
about 2017 charge-offs is higher than 2016. So I want to say that this is how growth math works.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Okay, I mean, look, I think you guys recognize the same thing in terms of how important
that issue is given that you provided guidance in terms of charge-offs a little bit – for 2017 a little bit earlier than you
have in the past.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Right, well, see, I think absolutely, Rick. And the way we looked at it is that – and why
we stepped out of character a little bit to provide guidance farther out into the future is that we were moving into a
period where two things were true. One is that we were growing at a pretty rapid rate and expected to continue to do
that, which is in fact turned out to be the case, and it comes off of just a – you probably won't see it again in your years
of following this industry in terms of how seasoned and recession sort of survived the existing back book is. And so the
impact of all of that led us to feel it was important to give a sense of where with lots of other things being equal growth

math would take our credit. And that's why – and along the way to explain to you how growth math works.
But I want to pull up on this. I have found over the many years in building Capital One that just about anything that's
really value creating involves digging a hole before the benefits come. If it weren't that way, everybody would rush in
and do it and it actually would kill the opportunity. And we have many, many, many years of experience in studying
credit and understanding how value gets created over time by origination.
But the key is very solid underwriting, incredibly rigorous what I call horizontal accountings that one understands the
full vintage economics and how those – how they perform over time. And then finally helping our investors along the
way to understand what comes with that journey. And we – but if we pull way up at this very time when there is –
credit losses are going up, allowances being built, we feel great about the business that we are booking.
We're incredibly happy that we've had the growth opportunity for the period of time that we have. We know
competition is increasing. But we're still pretty bullish that we can get some continuing growth opportunities. And I
think this can be a real value creator for our investors.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

And next we have Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson.
<Q - Arren Cyganovich>: Thanks. Rich, in your prepared remarks, you talked about competition picking up in the
domestic credit card market across I guess all of the platforms that you work in reward, subprime. And I guess my
question is more about you still finding opportunities in there, but you're also seeing this increasing competition. I'm
trying to balance the way that you're discussing this. It seems as though that it's becoming more difficult and maybe
you're signaling that loan growth could slow a little bit from here. I'm just – I'm trying to understand what you're trying
to tell us in that comment.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, I think for those who – you don't know – know me, Al, I try to operating in this
thing. It's less about signaling and more about just describing what we see and sharing with you what are the so what's
of that. So I start with, we are very bullish about our growth opportunity.
It is a factual matter that the growth rate is down over some of the highs of the last couple quarters on a year-over-year
basis, but we're continuing to have pretty significant and to us very attractive growth. But we are very obsessive about
how the – how competition works. So many – so often, people always talk about, well, what's the economy doing and
how big is the opportunity. Number one in our list is how does the – what is the nature of the competitive environment,
and that, of course, in its most first-order effect affects growth itself.
And so it is noteworthy that competition from Rewards all the way down to subprime despite sometimes protestations
of folks that they don't do subprime, there is an increase. And in fact the actual growth rate in subprime by our tally,
industry is actually higher than in prime, so there is – and you can see in the overall revolving debt numbers, growth is
up.
So all other things being equal, that increases the challenge with respect to our own growth rate, but again we've
created some I think pretty unique opportunities, and we like the value that we're offering customers, the customer
experience, and we feel good about that opportunity.
The second thing, and I made the same point last quarter and I make it so often, is when – there's a very natural – what
we're seeing here is a very natural part of how the competitive cycle works, but increased growth over time tends to
make its way into credit metrics in the industry as well. All of us – this is an industry where all of us share a lot of the
same customers. So, it is a natural part of this cycle that when you have sustained competition, typically we tend to see
on a delayed basis that that makes its way into industry credit metrics.

And then, and then the thing even more worrisome that we look for and we have not seen this is sort of at the next stage
in cycles, do people actually start really compromising their underwriting standards, and that becomes something that is
kind of at the next level in how these cycles evolve. So we feel great about the opportunity. It's not lost on us as the
competition has increased, and industry growth is up, and we will watch incredibly vigilantly. We will continue to
pursue this growth window because we're very focused on windows of opportunity as a company. We believe in this
window, we will continue to pursue it with our eyes wide open. And that's kind of how we operate at Capital One.

And next from KBW, we will hear from Sanjay Sakhrani.
<Q - Steven Kwok>: Hi. This is actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay. I just wanted to touch back on the
competition. Is it due to existing players, or are there new entrants that's coming in, in both the credit card and the auto
side?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: This is – this competition, by the way, there is not like some big thing that happened in
the last quarter, this is a creeping increase in competition. It is – it's primarily by the biggest players in the business
who in fact definitionally dominate the business. So you have seen some increased competition. In the rewards space,
you have seen some competitors strengthen some of their rewards propositions, value propositions, just volume. There
is actually been people stepping up and announcing they're going to step up some of their marketing, and finally, we
can see it just in some of the growth numbers across the segment.
I would also point out in the – that there is sort of pulling back beyond sort of credit cards or auto for that matter. There
continues to be growth in other forms of consumer credit like installment loans and student loans. So that's part of the
supply equation as well. But this is something that – we could give a continuing description about this phenomenon
because over time that that these things affect the business.
But the main point I want to leave with you is in the card business and really in the auto business, we remain bullish
about the opportunity and very bullish about the business that we have been able to generate.
<Q - Steven Kwok>: Thanks. And then separately on the efficiency ratio front, how much leverage do you guys have
in terms of for next year? How should we think about that?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: I know there is much to do beyond the guidance that we've already given you. Is there
something else that you'd like to discuss? I mean, that's kind of as far as we've been prepared to go.
<Q - Steven Kwok>: I just wanted to quantify in terms of the continued improvement in 2017?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: We're not going to go to the quantification. It's the guidance kind of is what we've stated,
and it's been stated for a while. So it's going to be a function of a whole bunch of things. But that's a long ways out
going into 2017.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

And next we'll hear from Chris Brendler with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. Can you talk at all about the comments on interchange
pressure? Look at your net interchange rate is down about 15 basis points in last two years. How much of that is
increasing rewards expense, and how much of the decline recently has been from this large merchant affect? My sense

is most of it is higher rewards expense rather than some significant decrease in interchange rates. Thank you.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. Again, I don't think we're going to get into the minutia on line by line with each of
these things and the factors that are driving our income statement. We're trying to give you a sense of the major things.
But you've kind of heard our commentary on what the impacts are. And that's kind of probably where I'd leave it.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: I guess I'll ask a different way. Is there – if I look back historically, net interchange used
to be 150 basis points maybe 5, 10 years ago, and now we're down to 87. I mean is this a race to the bottom or do you
think it will stabilize at some point?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I think that the entire industry is – look, there's competition both on the front-end kind of
marketed products and what are the rewards that are being offered. And the other trend is very important one to point
out is, the extension of more rewards deeper into various competitors, including our own customer base.
So, look, I think that will play out for some time. I don't think this is a race down to zero. I really believe in the
business, and I think that we are incredibly bullish about the opportunity in this business, and the long-term economics
in the business. I think we have wanted to point out that over a multi-year period there is this migration that has gone
on.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: You can't just look at the rewards decline in a vacuum, but the Rewards benefits that
we've provided to customers in terms of additional share of wallet have been very important to the business. So there
are other things that contribute to the value of that relationship aside from just what's happening in that Rewards.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Next we'll hear from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. I know that you don't think about the reserve as a percentage of loans in
the credit card business, but I guess it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect. Right? You've given a lot of specific
guidance that you've actually been needing on a monthly and quarterly basis in terms of the charge-offs and then there
are those of us on the side who seem to be getting wrong the reserve build.
And with what seems like relative stability in the charge-offs, right, you're talking about charge-offs that have averaged
a little more than 4% for the first half, and you're saying pretty much that for the full year, so not a big change in the
next couple of quarters and then low 4s after that, so really not – doesn't – this doesn't sound like there's a big change in
that. I understand that you've got to provide for growth, but are we close to a point where we should be seeing that
reserve to loans being relatively stable?
<A - Richard Scott Blackley>: Hi, Moshe. It's Scott. I think that using coverage rates is a tough thing for our business,
because we do have a lot of seasonal activity as you know, and so as balances fluctuate that – those coverage ratios can
send false signals. I think I would say that, as we've told you, we expect losses to increase 2016 to 2017, and that means
that the rate of allowance growth in those periods is going to be more than the loan growth, all else being equal.
And as Rich mentioned, there is going to be a point where you start to see the growth math effects moderate and at that
point we would expect that relationship to change, but we do expect that we are going to continue to see fluctuations in
the allowance quarter-to-quarter. I really do appreciate that modeling that thing is tough. And I'm just going to give you
a very blunt hypothetical example that a 10 basis point move in loss rate, which can easily happen, not being anything
more than noise, can trigger a $90 million allowance change. So, there is nothing that I would point to, and I definitely
believe that the most important thing for you to look at in terms of where we think credit is going and what's driving
our allowances is the guidance that we have already provided.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Right. I guess, Scott, not trying to be combative here, but the problem is if you are
telling us that the guidance is the same, that's where we are struggling, because if the guidance is the same, and we've

seen the additions over the last five quarters, I guess, what is different? Is it just that...
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: But Moshe, we didn't provide you guidance on allowance build.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Understood.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: So that's not something that we are prepared to do. What we can tell you is what drives
allowance build: growth in our portfolio, change in credit card charge-offs, which we have given you insight into. And
then Scott provided a very real example, a 10 basis point change, which is not very much, which is a third of the
reserve build we had this quarter. So you're not trying to be difficult, totally understand the genesis of the question. But
over the last 18 months is we knew this was going to be a real consideration.
We really deliberately tried to talk about the three or four factors that drive our allowance, and actually as Rich said
earlier, despite the discomfort, stepped out and went even further trying to predict loss rates in 2017 just to give people
a sense as to the fact that there weren't any surprises here. We really like the growth we're having, but it's – think about
it as a capital investment in growth. It's something that we believe is going to lead to real economic value creation.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Well, maybe this will be one of the advantages of CCL.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

Our next question is from James Fotheringham with the Bank of Montréal.
<Q - James Ronald Fotheringham>: Thanks. So if growth math works both ways, just roughly, how meaningful a
deceleration in loan growth from the current level hypothetically would be required to affect a change in provisions,
say, with a two-year view, all else being equal? And I'm not looking for precision here. But just roughly do you need
hundreds of basis points in deceleration to affect a change, and is the relationship on the way down linear or is it more
of a step change? Thanks.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: I don't even know where to – I mean the fact that we are having deceleration in growth,
if you can go back to, I think, Scott's explanation – excellent explanation of if we have just lower growth next quarter,
by definition, we are going to have a lower allowance build for that growth.
And then if you have lower new originations, then you have a higher percentage of the back book relative to the front
book compared to what you otherwise would have. So that in some degree will drive down the allowance build. But
that's all else equal as well. So I don't know that we can go a lot further than that and give you some intuition about the
way that this is going to unfold.
<Q - James Ronald Fotheringham>: That's helpful. Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. Look, I don't think people should expect that if the very high growth rate we have
been going on turns into a pretty high growth rate that you're going to see some big sea change here. This is still – we
are originating – these are a lot of originations. And as a percentage relative to the back book, we are building, which is
great news for value creation, a bigger and bigger percentage of our book has actually been recently originated. So
growth math will be with us in terms of how losses go up. That's going to be with us through – that's not going to
suddenly turn around. But I think that what I like so much about this is the coiled spring of economic value for which
we are paying upfront through higher – through allowance build and a loss curve that is front-loaded.
That coils the spring of value creation in a business and in an industry that doesn't have that many of those kind of
opportunities. And this is in many ways really the payoff for the information-based strategy we invested for years, and I
would also point out too that we're a company that – while a lot of companies look around and say what's the next thing
we can buy, we are a company that is designed to, as an origination-based company, where can we really massively test
and find growth opportunities that really pay off in the long term and work with our investors to understand the journey

of how the performance actually plays out.
But the payoff is not going to come in the near term by credit losses turning around and going down. This is – over the
longer term each vintage will peak and actually go down, and there is a continuing dividend that will be paid over time.
But right now this is the period of rising losses and growth math on the way up.

Thank you, gentlemen. Our last question of the day will be from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Matt, your line is
open.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Hi, there. Can you hear me now?
<A>: Yes.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of administrative questions. First, the
release of the unfunded commitments in the Oil and Gas Portfolio, where did that run through the income statement?
Was that in operating expenses?
<A - Richard Scott Blackley>: Hey, Matt. This is Scott. The release actually runs through as part of our provision
expense.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay, okay. Thank you. And then the FDIC insurance assessments, have you
quantified the size of those?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. That will be about $20 million a quarter starting in the third quarter.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. And then, just on the taxi medallion portfolio, I appreciate it's not huge. It's less
than $1 billion, obviously. But do you have any color as to how that – how you're thinking that will continue to
perform? Are there other cities where you are concerned about a meaningful drop in valuation, similar to what you saw
in Chicago?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Matt, let me start, and then others can pile in. So, first of all, if you look at kind of the
allowance build in this quarter, I mentioned that we have $100 million in Chicago, and we did observe in that market a
pretty steep decline in prices of traded taxi medallion. So, that's principally what's going on in that market. The other
market that we have our principal exposure to is in New York, which is a different market. I think we have talked about
that in markets where it's a hail market, prices have seemed to be more stable. And so I don't want too much confidence
about kind of where we see things moving in New York, but definitely kind of our level of concern about Chicago is
much higher than what we would say in the New York marketplace. It's just a different business model right now.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay, thank you.
