MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Accenture's Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Angie Park. Please go
ahead.
Angie Park
Thank you, Shannon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings
announcement. As Shannon just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.
With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief
Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.
Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take
you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet for the second quarter. Pierre will
then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook for the third quarter
and full fiscal year 2017. We'll then take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on the call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as
such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in
today's news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other
SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on this
call.

During our call today, we'll reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in
our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, Angie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are very pleased with our financial results for the
second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2017. For the quarter, we again delivered broad-based revenue growth across
many dimensions of our business, and we continue to gain significant market share. We see excellent demand for
services, especially in high-growth areas such as digital, cloud and security-related services.
Our very strong bookings come from both the relevance and success of our strategy to rotate our business to the New
and support our confidence as we look ahead to the rest of the fiscal year.
Here are a few highlights for the second quarter and year-to-date. We delivered very strong new bookings of $9.2
billion for the quarter and $17.5 billion for the first half. We grew revenue 6% in local currency for the quarter and 7%
year-to-date with continued strong growth across many areas of our business.
We delivered earnings per share of $1.33, which brings EPS for the first half of the year to $2.91, an 11% increase on
an adjusted basis. Operating margin was 13.7% for the quarter and 14.7% for the six months, an expansion of 20 basis
points year-to-date. We generated free cash flow of $50 million for the quarter and $1 billion year-to-date. And we
continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including
more than $2 billion year-to-date.
Today, we announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share, which will bring total dividend payments for the
year to $2.42 per share, a 10% increase over last year.
So, with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about our business. We see very strong demand in the
marketplace for our differentiated capabilities and remain confident in our ability to deliver our business outlook for the
year.
Now, let me hand over to David, who will review the numbers in greater details. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thanks, Pierre, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call. Overall, we delivered strong results in the second
quarter, which were aligned with our expectations and position us very well to achieve our full-year financial guidance.
We continue to see favorable market conditions in most areas of our business, especially as it relates to strong demand
for digital, cloud and security-related services, which plays to our strength as a leader in innovating and leading in the
New.
Our second quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate our ability to continue to deliver on the essential elements of
our formula for driving superior shareholder value. So, before I get into the details, let me summarize some of the
major headlines.
Net revenue growth in local currency of 6% in the second quarter and 7% year-to-date continues to significantly
outpace the market, driven by double-digit growth in all three components of the New, including digital, cloud and
security-related services. Growth continues to be broad-based with positive growth in the vast majority of our
industries and geographic markets, more than offsetting cyclical market pressures that continue in a few concentrated
areas of our business, specifically, energy, chemicals and natural resources and communications and media. Absent
those concentrated areas of pressure, the majority of our business grew 9% on a quarter-to-date basis and 10% on a

year-to-date basis.
Operating margin of 13.7% in the quarter came in as expected and consistent with last year. Operating margin of 14.7%
for the first half of the year represents 20 basis points of expansion. These results continue to reflect significant levels
of investment in our business and our people to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness in the
marketplace.
And on a year-to-date basis, we've delivered 11% growth in earnings per share over fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS. Our free
cash flow of $50 million in the quarter and over $1 billion year-to-date puts us on a trajectory to deliver on our annual
guidance, which reflects free cash flow in excess of net income. And importantly, we continue to execute against our
strategic capital allocation objectives: first, by investing over $800 million across 16 transactions in the first half of the
year; and, second, by returning roughly $2.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
So, as Pierre said, we are pleased with our overall results so far this year and we're encouraged by the trends we see in
the market and the potential for even stronger growth and momentum in the second half of the year.
With that said, let's get into the details of the quarter, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9.2 billion for
the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.6 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1, and outsourcing bookings were $4.6
billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2.
We're very pleased with our bookings, which landed in the range we expected and represents the third highest level of
new bookings over the past 10 quarters. From a business dimension perspective, we were pleased with our bookings in
both strategy and consulting services combined and application services. And as you would expect, digital, cloud and
security-related services continued to be an important theme in the work we contracted with our clients.
Looking forward, we began the third quarter with a healthy pipeline, and we believe we're positioned for continued
strong bookings in the second half of the year.
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.32 billion, a 5% increase in USD, 6% in local currency,
reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%, consistent with the guidance provided last quarter. Our
consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.4 billion, up 3% in USD and 5% in local currency. And our outsourcing
revenues were $3.9 billion, up 7% in USD and 8% in local currency.
Looking at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our five business dimensions. Growth was led by
operations, which posted double-digit growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. Application services delivered
mid-single digit growth, and strategy and consulting services combined grew low-single digits. Once again, the
dominant driver of our growth was continued strong double-digit growth in the New, with all three components
growing double digits as well.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups. Products, our largest operating group, led with 15% growth, reflecting
continued strong momentum in the business. Growth continued to be broad-based with strong growth across all
geographies and industries. Financial Services grew 8% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in banking and
capital markets globally and overall in both Europe and the growth markets. As expected, banking and capital markets
in North America returned to positive growth this quarter.
H&PS came in as expected at 2% growth, with positive growth in both Health & Public Service globally and strong
overall growth in both Europe and the growth markets. Overall growth in North America was flat. We expect H&PS to
deliver stronger growth in the second half of the year and to deliver full year growth in the mid-single digit range,
consistent with the comments I made in September.
Communications, Media & Technology grew 1%, reflecting the solid positive growth in North America and
double-digit growth in the growth markets, partially offset by continued contraction in Europe. From an industry
perspective, CMT was led by significant double-digit growth in software and platforms with positive growth in
electronics and high-tech. However, Communications and Media contracted on an overall basis, primarily driven by
our business in Europe. We expect that revenue growth in our European Communications and Media business will
continue to be challenged for the rest of the year.

Finally, Resources revenues decreased 1% in the quarter, which is in the range we expected, and the storyline remains
the same. We continue to see strong growth in utilities, which is more than offset by challenges in both energy and
chemicals and natural resources, especially in North America. We expect our Resources group to continue to navigate a
challenging environment, but to deliver positive growth in the second half of the year.
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 30.1% compared to 29.8% in the same period
last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5%, consistent with the same quarter last year. General
and administrative expense was 5.9% compared to 5.7% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $1.1
billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin consistent with quarter two last year.
As a reminder, in the second quarter of last year, we closed our Navitaire transaction, which lowered our quarter two
tax rate by 1.7% and increased net income by $495 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.74. The following
comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7% compared with an adjusted tax rate of 15.4% for the same period last
year. Net income was $887 million for the second quarter compared with adjusted net income of $905 million for the
same quarter last year.
Our diluted earnings per share were $1.33 compared with adjusted EPS of $1.34 in the second quarter last year. Days
services outstanding were 42 days compared to 44 days last quarter and 39 days in the second quarter of last year.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $50 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $155 million, net
of property and equipment additions of $104 million. Our cash balance at February 28 was $3.2 billion compared with
$4.9 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return the cash to shareholders, in the second
quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 7 million shares for $816 million at an average share price of $117.27 per share.
At February 28, we had approximately $4.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
As Pierre just mentioned, our board of directors declared a dividend of $1.21 per share, representing a 10% increase of
the dividend we paid in May of last year and this dividend will be paid on May 15, 2017.
So, at the halfway point to 2017, we feel good about our results and our positioning to deliver on our full year business
outlook. We continue to be laser-focused on driving our business to achieve our core financial objectives, which
include growing faster than the market, delivering modest margin expansion and strong EPS growth, investing at scale
for market leadership and generating strong cash flow, which is both invested in the business and returned to
shareholders through disciplined and smart capital allocation.
With that, let me turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David. Our strong performance in the second quarter and year-to-date demonstrates that we are executing
our strategy very well to position Accenture as the leading and most innovative professional services company for the
new digital world.
With 7% revenue growth in local currency in the first half of the fiscal year, we are clearly growing faster than the
market. This is driven by our accelerated rotation to the New, digital, cloud and security-related services, which
generated revenues of about $8 billion in the first half, more than 45% of total revenues, and continue to grow at a
strong double-digit rate. And I'm particularly pleased that we have achieved these results while continuing to invest for
the future, in strategic acquisitions, in building assets and solutions and the skills of our people, while at the same time
returning substantial cash to shareholders.
For Accenture, acquisitions are managing to drive organic growth above the market, and we have stepped up our pace
of acquisitions, investing more than $800 million of capital in the first half of the fiscal year. And in the second quarter
alone, we completed or announced 11 acquisitions to further strengthen our capabilities.

In digital, we're acquiring SinnerSchrader, one of the largest digital agencies in Germany. In cloud, we acquired
solid-serVision, a leading ServiceNow provider. In security, we acquired Endgame for the oil services business and
announced the acquisition of iDefense and Arismore.
Avanade, our majority-owned joint venture with Microsoft, acquired Infusion, a leading provider of digital
transformation services in the Microsoft ecosystem. And we completed three acquisitions that further enhance our
industry-deep expertise; InvestTech in asset management, Seabury Group in aviation and Davies Consulting in utilities.
Across Accenture, we are leveraging the capabilities we have acquired to bring even more innovation to clients and to
drive growth and scale organically. With MOBGEN, which is part of Accenture Digital, we teamed with Shell and
Jaguar Land Rover to create the first ever payment system in a car. This new innovation allows drivers to pay at Shell
stations using an in-car touchscreen and app, ultimately delivering a better and more convenient customer experience.
In banking and capital markets, our recent acquisitions of InvestTech and Beacon Consulting are further strengthening
our asset management capabilities, adding deep skills and industry expertise, which has enabled us to win new business
with top-tier asset managers.
And in security, with the capability of FusionX, which we acquired in 2015, we are helping a large international
resource company [indiscernible] (17:41) millions of daily transactions providing advanced services, such as security
audit across 15 properties, digital identity management and rigorous testing to prevent cyber attacks.
We also continued to make significant investments in our unique innovation architecture, which integrates our
capability across research, ventures, labs and studios to pioneer new ways of collaborating with clients to develop and
deliver disruptive innovations.
As part of our innovation-led approach, we're opening new facilities around the world, including several in just the last
few months. In Dublin, we opened The Dock, our new multi-disciplinary innovation, R&D and incubation hub, where
all elements of our innovation architecture come to life. The Dock is a launch pad for our more than 200 researchers to
innovate with clients and ecosystem partners with a particular focus on artificial intelligence.
In Hong Kong, we launched an Accenture Interactive Studio, where we are bringing together end-to-end digital
customer experience services for clients. In London and Singapore, we opened new Accenture Liquid Studios, designed
to help clients apply rapid development techniques like Agile methodologies and DevOps to quickly turn concepts into
products.
And finally, in the United States, we are accelerating our innovation investment including 10 new innovation hubs. We
just opened our first one in Houston, enabling us to collaborate more closely with clients to co-create and scale
innovative solutions.
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I'm going to comment on our results for both the quarter and the
first half of the year. In North America, we grew revenues in local currency 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date,
driven by the United States where we continue to grow ahead of the market. And given our strong market position and
pipeline, we expect to see stronger growth in North America in the second half of the fiscal year.
In Europe, we continue to grow significantly ahead of the market with 7% revenue growth in local currency for both
the quarter and the first half, driven primarily by double-digit growth in the United Kingdom, Germany and
Switzerland. We are confident Europe will keep up the strong pace in the second half. And in growth markets, we were
very pleased with our 9% growth in local currency for the quarter and 10% year-to-date, led once again by very strong
double-digit growth in Japan, as well as strong growth in China and Australia. We expect growth markets to accelerate
its growth in the second half.
Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on our talent strategy to lead in the New. The large-scale
transformation of our business is requiring a very significant investment in our people to ensure they have the most
relevant skills to serve our clients both today and in the future. We are proactively training and up-scaling thousands of
people in key areas, such as cloud, artificial intelligence and robotics. In new IT alone, which is all about new

Our approach to continuously investing in the skills and capabilities of our people helps us meets the needs of our

Accenture was recently named one of the Fortune's Best Companies to Work For, for the ninth consecutive year.
So, with that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David?
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect revenues to
be in the range of $8.65 billion to $8.90 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 2.5% compared to
the third quarter fiscal 2016 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2017,
based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our
results in U.S. dollars will be negative 2% compared to fiscal 2016. For the full fiscal 2017, we now expect our net
revenue to be in the range of 6% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal 2016.
Before I continue with our business outlook, as a reminder, in March 2016, we announced the termination of our U.S.
pension plan. We expect to record a non-cash charge of approximately $425 million upon final settlement in quarter
three 2017. We will provide both GAAP and adjusted quarter three and year-to-date results.
For operating margin, on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 basis point to
30 basis point expansion over fiscal 2016 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate on an adjusted
basis to be in the range of 22% to 24%. For earnings per share on an adjusted basis and reflecting our updated revenue
range, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.87 or 7% to 10% growth
over adjusted fiscal 2016 results.
For the full fiscal 2017, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion,
property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $4 billion
to $4.3 billion.
We continue to expect to return at least $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchase and also continue to expect
to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than 1% as we remain committed to
returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
And finally, for the full year, we now expect to invest in the range of $1.5 billion in acquisitions.
With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Angie?
Angie Park
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as
possible to ask a question. Shannon, would you provide instructions for those on the call?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please

<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi. Good morning, David. I just want to ask on bookings. It came in at $9.2 billion. I know
the Street was at $10 billion. And at $9.2 billion and I guess, down 3% year-over-year. But it sounds like that was
within the range of your expectations. So, just trying to gauge, was bookings a little bit lighter than you expected, or
was the Street just too aggressive in their assumptions?
And then, just secondly, on the potential for stronger growth in second half 2017, maybe you can just give us an idea of
what that looks like between consulting and outsourcing. In particular, consulting slowed a little bit this quarter. But
maybe it sounds like it's going to pick up. Thanks so much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. So, first of all, on the bookings, putting aside the consensus estimate, what I had
signaled last quarter that we felt confident that bookings would be stronger in the second quarter than the first quarter,
beginning a pattern of building through the year which is typically what we've seen. And so, we ended up with about $1
billion more in bookings in the second quarter versus the first quarter. That's consistent with the comments that I made,
and it's in the range that we expected.
I mean, as you know, there's – in any particular quarter, there are a few deals that can fall on either side of the line, so
we will always have kind of a range that we expect to land in and we're very solidly in the range that we expected.
And for the full year, we're very optimistic about our bookings. As I've said, we began the third quarter, second half of
the year with a healthy pipeline and we expect to see continued strong bookings in the third and fourth quarter,
supporting our revenue guidance.
In terms of the growth by type of work, which I think was the other part of your question, is that right?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes.
<A - David P. Rowland>: I guess, he's dropped off the line. So, for the full year, we expect consulting type of work
growth to be in the mid- to high-single digits, and we expect outsourcing type of work growth to be in the mid- to
high-single digits as well. If you look at it by business dimension, which I also comment on, we think strategy and
consulting services combined will be in the mid-single digit range. So, we do see an increase in the growth rate of our
strategy and consulting services combined in the second half of the year. We see application services in the mid-single
digit range. We see operations in the double-digit range. And of course, the New will continue to grow very strong,
double-digit growth throughout this year.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Thanks so much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right. Thank you, Bryan.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Schneider>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hi, Jim.
<Q - James Schneider>: Hi, David. I was wondering – maybe to follow-up on the previous question. You delivered
pretty good, 6% growth this quarter and there was [ph] a little better (28:34) last quarter. So, I guess, can you maybe
talk about – and you talked about acceleration in the back half of the year. So, can you maybe talk about some of the
factors that you're seeing that would raise – lead you do not raise your revenue outlook for the full year, given the
commentary you just made about the back half?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. So, let me give a few comments, and Pierre will perhaps want to make some comments
as well from his perspective. So, let me just start. When we provided full-year guidance of 5% to 8%, we really entered
the year with one possible scenario, where the growth in the first half of the year would be relatively speaking lower
than the second half of the year. And that scenario, in fact, is continuing to play out.

As we always say, we started the year, although we had a range of 5% to 8%, as we say, working hard each and every
day to be at the upper end of the range. And that is still our focus.
In terms of what's underneath that, I mean, there's a couple of ways I could kind of help you understand the way we
look at the first half versus the second half of the year. The one way is through the lens of what I have called out as
these three concentrated areas of pressure, which make up 15% to 18% of our revenue overall.
And when you look at those three areas, energy, chemicals and natural resources and communications and media, two
of those three areas, we see and we believe we will see positive growth in the second half of the year relative to where
they were in the first half of the year. And we have some confidence in that.
Beyond that, when you look at the rest of our business, which is growing 10% on a year-to-date basis, even within that,
we see certain areas of our business that did have positive growth in the first half of the year, but we expect will have
even more positive growth in the second half of the year. And an industry that comes to mind is health, for example,
which has been lower in North America but we expect will be stronger in the second half of the year, more in kind of
the typical growth rates that we expect for health.
So, overall, the year is really playing out as we expected. We continue to work hard to try to land in the upper end of
our range, as we always do. Supporting our confidence level in the second half of the year, we narrowed the range to
6% to 8%.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes – no, [ph] it's hard to build on this. (31:13) I mean, you said it very well. I mean, to put it
very simply, we feel very good for the second half of the year, and that's it, based on facts. We have very good
bookings. We have good pipeline. We have great momentum in most parts of our business. Just to give you a clue,
we're covering 13 industries [ph] group it, (31:39) if you will. 13 industries.
On these 13 industries, 10 are positive. And on the 10, 6 are high-single – when I say high single, one is at 9.5%. Let's
round it to 10% for simplicity. Six would be double digits. So, you could only be positive when you see such a
momentum.
Indeed, we have three very specific situations. And frankly, these three situations, at least two are linked to some client
situation where indeed the business has been slowing down for absolutely good and valid reasons. And we have
evidence that the two industries in resources, C&R and energy, will be back in the second half of the year. So, I'm
extremely positive for the second part of the year.

<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Sitting outside...
<A - David P. Rowland>: Pierre said he appreciates the commitment. You may not have heard that.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Well, not too bad. I'm sitting outside. The wind feels good. Well, Virginia lost, so this is a
good way to take my mind off of things focusing on Accenture. I'll ask about – I guess, you just talked about the three
areas of pressure. Some of them are linked to client situations. I'm curious. Have you been able to replenish your
pipeline? Or are you saying just comps improved? Are you actually selling into those existing clients? Just trying to
understand how you're able to sort of remix out of the troubled areas and see improvement there. Did that make sense?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. I would say it's a combination of the two. I mean, just to be blunt, it is a combination
of the two. There is a benefit from the comps getting easier, and that's just the math. But more importantly, there are
really underlying fundamental improvements that we see in the business activity. The dialogue that we're having with
our clients. The investment in digitization in addition to the kind of the cost-rationalization focus that those industries
have had for so many quarters now. And so, the comps are part of it. But there is some fundamental improvement in the
business, a lot of green shoots that we see that I think have us much more optimistic about the trajectory.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And I would add, if you look at Resources, which has been one of the area of watch,
carefully, again, that's so tough because you're not mentioning utilities. Our utilities business has continued growing
double digits. So, this one is on reasonably good fire, and we're doing very well because this is an industry rotating
rapidly to the New, and you have a direct correlation in the business with the rotation to the New from our clients and
the performance of these industries. This is as simple as this.
Energy is back. And I think, when I look at the three, energy and then you have CNR, chemical and natural resources.
CNR being the smallest of the three, to be clear. And so, energy is very important moving forward, and we are getting
more and more evidence that energy will perform much better in the second part of the year.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: I see. Okay. Just my quick follow up on just the M&A contribution in the quarter and for the
year. It sounds like you upped the spend target to $1.5 billion.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. It's – so, for the full year, we continued to expect to be in the range of 2%. But if you
peel it back, H1 is, let's say, closer to 1.5% and H2 would be closer to 2.5%. And so, in the second half of the year, we
will see an additional contribution in inorganic relative to H1. But for the full year, it'll still be in the 2% range. The
additional spend up to $1.5 billion, Tien-Tsin, a lot of that will happen in the fourth quarter and the revenue impact of
those transactions is much more relevant to FY 2018 than it would be FY 2017.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Got it, got it. Thank you so much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Okay. Thank you.

And the next question is from the line of David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead with your question.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David Grossman>: Good morning. So, I know there's been already several questions about growth. But if you
look back, consulting growth over the last four years has been pretty lumpy, right? 2013 and 2014, relatively weak;
2015 and 2016, relatively strong; and this year, it's falling somewhere in between. And I know we've had some fairly
significant technology cycles as well, as Pierre has outlined some pretty significant industry cycles impacting growth
for the entire industry. But can you help us think through what the growth in the consulting business should really look
like on a normalized basis, if there really is such a thing, recognizing that you've got a portfolio and there's always
going to be pluses and minuses each year?

<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. I would say, on a normalized basis, consulting and strategy services combined would
be in the mid-single digit kind of range to, let's say, high-single digit depending on the cycle that we're in. So, it's going
to be a mid- to high-single digit contributor across our portfolio of businesses.
I mean, the consulting growth, to be clear as well, is connected to this dynamic that we've talked about with our overall
growth, meaning that if you look at these three industries that are contracting primarily because of these cyclical
pressures, that has had an impact in recent quarters, in particular, on our consulting and strategy growth rate. And we
think that, that drag, if you will, that we've seen the last – let's say, the last few quarters will start to mitigate some in
the second half of the year. We're also making investments in our consulting business, which start to help drive our
growth rate in the second half of the year and beyond as well.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes – no, absolutely. I mean, the [ph] law and (38:28) the direction should be mid- to
high-single digits. We believe this is where the consulting business should be. Sometimes, you're going to be higher
than this because you have a combination of good factors. And sometimes, you're just a bit high. And here, we have
this combination of these three situations creating a disproportionate drag on our consulting. So, as we mentioned
before, definitely, two of the three will get back and so the consulting associated will get back as well.
On the other side of the spectrum, we are not only investing in what we call in the New, digital, cloud and security. But
we, as you know, are putting some investments in building extremely deep skills in areas where we believe there could
be higher growth in a very specific way. You've seen the acquisition of Kurt Salmon, a premium brand in retail in
North America. We are doing the same in aviation, in very deep skills, in investment management where we believe it's
going to be a great market and we are making acquisitions there on a very targeted basis. So, I'm extremely confident
that the consulting will be back.
<Q - David Grossman>: Right. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up to your comment about rescaling. Obviously,
the pace and breadth of the current cycle has driven the need to rescale at a faster than normal pace. So, that aside, is it
fair to expect after this year that the pace of acquisitions would continue to contribute this 2% rate of growth, or would
you expect that to come back a little bit as the cycle matures?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. I mean, we're putting a fairly significant attention on the skills of our people. I mean, we
just broke the 400,000 mark in terms of people and we want to have 400,000 talented people. And by talented people, I
mean, having the right skills is what we mean by talented people, the right skills for today and, more important, the
right skills for tomorrow.
So, what we did – they're not starting now, but starting years ago, is to make sure that, in training and education, we are
investing significantly. I think the number is public. We are roughly investing $900 million in training and education to
make sure that we have the best skilled people and we're able as well to attract the best talent. So, we're combining our
organic rescaling, if you will, $900 million. We have digitalized all of our training to make sure that our cost of training
is extremely efficient.
[ph] And I would just impress (41:12) to recognize my friend, Bhaskar Ghosh, on what he has been doing with our
Accenture Technology business in rescaling last year in what we call a new IT. 70,000 people. He's managing roughly
200,000 people, Bhaskar, roughly, if I may say. And the goal for us is to rescale 100% of these people over three years
70,000 plus 70,000 plus 70,000.
In addition, we are recruiting [ph] in through (41:42) acquisition very deep skills, very deep skills. We believe it's
going to take too long to grow organic. And so, we have a good, I think, a two-pronged strategy, if you will, investing
in our people to make them relevant. And I think this is something we always talk about to our people. We have a
responsibility. I feel that way. I just – I have the responsibility to make them relevant for the future and then
complement with high-notch, iconic talents we're getting from the market. So, we have a kind of perfect blend.
<Q - David Grossman>: Very good. Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right. Thank you, David.

The next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Good morning. I'm only on the East Coast, so not too bad out here.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, we appreciate your commitment as well...
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Well, thank you. My question is really around robotics and artificial intelligence from two
dimensions. How much are you applying that to your own business to maybe delink a little bit revenue from people
growth? And how much are you helping your clients? And at what pace is it coming on? Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. Thanks for the question. And answer to your question number one is extensively and
answer to question number two is extensively. I mean, what we are especially in Accenture Technology and in
Accenture Operations and of course in Accenture Digital, we have now infused in Accenture Technology all new
capabilities called for us Intelligent Platform. The name we're using – the public name is myWizard. myWizard is the
first in that category of Intelligent Platform, so you can develop code using more and more intelligent virtual agent. So,
we're doing that massively, but it's not enough.
We're indeed applying to Accenture Technology, technology delivery centers and more important to Accenture
Operations in our BPO centers, RPAs, I mean, Robotic Process Automations that we are executing for Accenture. And
it's interesting to see that many clients are visiting us and considering Accenture of now the benchmark, and they're
learning from what we do to apply to clients. So, extensively, in Accenture, because the name of the game isn't labor;
it's productivity and that's always been the name of the game in Accenture.
So, we want to operate at maximum productivity and efficiency with talented people. That's what we have in mind.
And as you said, starting to see in some parts of our BPO business, the decorrelation between revenue and labor. And
we believe strongly that the combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning, Robotics Process Automation in
the coming five years will make a significant difference in decorrelation between labor to revenue.
From a client standpoint, a huge demand. I've just been pitching RPA and closing RPA deals last week to – just to give
you a view. So, it's extremely vibrant. Why? Because the clients' agenda is still the same as we said I remember, in one
of our IR day, digitalization and rationalization. Digitalization to create new business model and all the architecture we
have been putting in place in the New is resonating with that with Accenture Interactive, mobility, analytics, cloud and
security. And rationalization, RPA is at the heart of rationalization, so robotics and automation and the demand is just
growing and we are very well positioned.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: My other question is on the benefits side of your pension charge. What kind of, in basis
points, contribution to operating margin will that drive in fiscal 2018? Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: It's not material. The – and I mean, in the scheme of Accenture, the benefits that we're
deriving from doing this are not that material in terms of the bottom line.

<Q - David E. Ridley-Lane>: Thank you. Good morning. I did want to – maybe touching on that last question. I know
you do not manage to gross margin, but the year-to-date gross margin expansion is notable given the longer-term
trends. Are you seeing the benefit of automation show up there? Or is this driven more from the revenue mix shift
towards digital? Just trying to get a sense of – is this theme of automation – Robotic Process Automation helping on the
gross margin today?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. It is – so, most of – by the way, gross margin – let me say that even though gross
margin has looked good the last two quarters, our message still stays the same. For many reasons we have explained,
we really focus more on operating margin. Having said that, to your question, the big driver I think when you look at
the first two quarters has been improvement in our contract profitability. So, our cost to serve clients is one of the major
components in our gross margin. And we have seen improvements in contract profitability, which reflects broadly some
of the improvements we've seen in pricing.
It reflects – there's some mix shift as we – let's say we have a higher percentage of higher value kind of added services,
even higher percentage of those – that type of work, which includes digital but not limited to digital in the mix, et
cetera and as well, just the overall efficiency of our payroll structure, which is of course the biggest driver of our cost
overall. And so, it's more about contract profitability and managing our payroll efficiency with a high – at a high level
of efficiency.
Is automation in the mix of our improved contract profitability? It is, but in no way would that be a dominant driver. It's
in the mix, but with many other things as well.
<Q - David E. Ridley-Lane>: And then, just as a quick one. Do you see any drag from regulatory uncertainty among
your U.S. health insurance clients? Or maybe said differently, since you expect an acceleration there, what would be
the main drivers to get you there?
<A - David P. Rowland>: We did see an impact in the pace of decision-making. When you look back now in the
rearview mirror, we did see an impact in the pace of decision-making in health in North America during the first half of
the year. We believe, and we've got fact points and tangible evidence that we would point to that, that slower pace of
decision-making is behind us and that, as we've now turned into the new calendar year, we are – every month that goes
by, we're a month into the new administration. Then, the decision-making is resumed at normal levels and that's part of
the reason why we are more – why we're positive on improved growth rates in the second half of the year. So, we did
see an impact in the first half of the year. We believe that that's largely behind us. Okay? Thank you, David.

<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could maybe
dig in a little bit to banking and financial services. You called out North American capital market's mix improving.
Maybe could you provide a little bit of color behind the improvement in that business and what the primary drivers
does that include might be?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. We – I mean, overall, financial services is doing very well. I mean, we have been

United States, where we expect great benefits starting in H2. And in addition, as I mentioned especially in investment
management, which is part of capital markets, we've made a few acquisitions. You've seen Beacon. And they are
providing as well deep skills.
So, again, as in everything, it's a combination of two or three factors you're putting together to create growth, and we
see some more optimism as well from clients linked to the expected deregulation of some part of their business. So, all
of this put together is creating an environment which is getting better.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Great. That's very helpful. Maybe as a follow up, can I ask about Accenture Interactive? In –
I've seen some kind of interesting moves in the press recently there. How big is that business? And is that primarily
CMT-focused? Or how do you plan to kind of leave that in with your digital aspiration...
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. I'm extremely pleased with Accenture Interactive. You're giving me the opportunity to
recognize the leader of Accenture Interactive, Brian Whipple, who is just doing a great job in leading that part of the
business. In less than probably seven years or something like this, we created the largest pure player in digital
marketing. So, the digital [ph] agents of (52:56) Accenture is now one of the largest and a category leader.
We are leading in digital design, especially after the acquisition of a company named Fjord and many other acquisition,
the last one between Karmarama in the UK, which is a premium independent – the best independent company in the
UK.
Digital production, you remember the acquisition of avVenta from years ago. Digital commerce, which of course is
very important on the back of the acquisition of equity we made in the U.S. some years ago and all what we are doing
in terms of customer analytics. So, we were very pleased that, last year, Advertising Age ranked Accenture Interactive
number one. And for us, it's a very critical milestone. We see more and more clients indeed turning from the so-called
holding companies to Accenture Interactive. And now, I'm very pleased to report that we are (sic) [will be] very close
to $6 billion [this fiscal year] in Accenture Interactive, making us the category leader.
So, we couldn't be more pleased with Accenture Interactive. As you know – sorry to elaborate a bit. I know we're
running almost out of time. I'm passionate about this, so I'm sharing my passion with you. The business in the future
will be more and more driven by experience and design of new capabilities, of new products, of new ways of engaging
with customer, consumer, patient, employees.
So, for us, it was absolutely critical to put on the top of our services the experience, this design-led, experience-led kind
of capability. And just to give you a data point, I think we acquired Fjord, they had 150 people roughly, 150, 180,
something like this, less than 200. Now, we're going to try the 800 people, in short making certainly Fjord one of the
largest pure player in digital creative design. So, that's what we do, and we're pleased.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Great. So, quite a bit larger than we last heard so that's great to hear. Very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: [ph] To you we (55:30) like to be. I mean, we – in our rotation to the New – and sorry to be a
bit too long about it. In our rotation to the New, in interactive, mobility, analytic, cloud and security, we want not only
to be the number one if you – [ph] addition this (55:45) whole thing. This is why we always have $8 billion in H1 only.
But we want to be number one in each of the five. That's what we mean by scaling to lead, and this is what we are
doing relentlessly.
<A - Angie Park>: Shannon, we have time for one more question. And then, Pierre will wrap up the call.

<A - David P. Rowland>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: So, I guess, what inning do you think digital might be in? And what's the next phase of the
digital movement?
<A - David P. Rowland>: It's – I mean, I would say that the digital wave is still – in your baseball analogy, I would
say it's still in the early innings. I mean, it's – there is a – if you talked about it in terms of the maturity curve, it is low
on the maturity curve. There's ways to go.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, early days.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: If you look at this, and of course some capabilities are more mature than the others. And
when we're putting that in our Accenture framework, we said you have three waves. I mean, the digital consumer, and
this one is quite maturing a lot because, I mean, you see it is probably where we're doing the majority of Accenture
Interactive business of about – around $6 billion.
Then, you have the digital enterprise, how you digitalize all the parts of the enterprise. And here, the robotics and the
automation, we are bringing a lot. So, I think this is coming. And then, you have what we call in digital operations an
IoT, and this is nascent, to be honest, and that might be certainly the biggest wave of the three.
And so, we are positioning Accenture already in what we're calling Industry X.0. We are formerly 4.0, as we speak, but
they're going to be 5.0, 6.0, and we're positioning a lot Accenture of mobility, connected platform, Internet of Things.
We have already developed many partnerships in the ecosystem with OEM providers to extend our reach to this
industry-all Internet. We have labs. I'm thinking about what we have in Bangalore, what we have in Beijing, where we
are developing very deep industry solutions in the context of the IoT. So, it's early days. I mean, it's going to be a wave
for probably a couple of decades.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Okay. And then, just as a quick follow-up. How is competition in outsourcing, particularly with
pricing? Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: I would say that really no notable change in the competitive landscape in outsourcing. If
you're maybe asking specifically about the application maintenance piece of our application services, that continues to
be a very, very competitive pricing environment. So, that's more of the same. And I would say, if you look at BPO as
another big piece of outsourcing, I would say no notable change.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: So, no notable change but some at Accenture, again, because if there is something we hate in
our company is commoditization of services. So, we're fighting against commoditization always to move and rotate to
higher value services. The business you're mentioning is subject to commoditization at a great pace.
Our answer to fight against commoditization has been to infuse, as I mentioned before, through Bhaskar Ghosh and
Debbie Polishook leading Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations. So, a lot of robotics, a lot of automation,
less labor [ph] arbitrage (59:38) more technology, more intelligence. And so, indeed we want to make these activities
more tech automated-led, less labor intensive like many of our competitors have been doing, and we are following a
very different trajectory.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Thanks.
Pierre Nanterme
Okay. It's time to wrap up. Thanks a lot for being so patient. With that, thanks again for joining us on the call today.
As you can tell and have heard from David and I, we are very confident in our ability to deliver another strong year
with fiscal year 2017 to continue gaining significant market share as we do to even further accelerate our rotation to
new and innovative services. And at the same time, as we are investing significantly for the future, continuing
