MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's
call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you
may begin.
Jamie Caulfield
Thank you, Operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's
CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our first quarter performance and 2013 outlook and then we'll move
onto Q&A. In an effort to get to as many analyst questions as possible within the hour, we've kept our prepared remarks
relatively short this morning. And we're going to have a one question limit, so we should be able to get through the full
queue of analysts when we get to Q&A.
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking
statements, including statements regarding 2013 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking
statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
predicted in such forward-looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together
with the cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release and in our most recent
periodic reports filed with the SEC.
Unless otherwise indicated, all references to EPS and total operating profit growth are on a core basis. In addition,
references to organic revenue results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes

when discussing PepsiCo's financial results, please refer to the Glossary and other attachments to this morning's
earnings release and to the Investor section of PepsiCo's website under the Investor Presentations tab.
As we discuss our results today, please keep in mind that our Q1 reporting period is the 12 weeks ended March 23 for
our North America businesses and is the months of January and February for the vast majority of our businesses
outside North America.
And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
Indra K. Nooyi
Thanks, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Last February, we announced and then executed a number of important
actions to strengthen and ensure the long-term success of our business. Since then, we have driven greater productivity,
significantly increased our advertising and marketing investments and upped our execution in the market. Today, I'm
very pleased to report strong first quarter results. We had mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, double-digit core
EPS growth and a significant improvement in cash flow. We feel good about these results in what has been and
continues to be a competitive landscape and a volatile macro environment. The first quarter has us confident that we're
on track to meet our 2013 financial guidance.
Our organic revenue growth was 4.4%, right in line with our mid-single-digit long-term target, with particularly strong
growth at Frito-Lay North America, Latin America snacks, international beverages and snacks and beverages
throughout Asia, Middle East & Africa. Organic revenue growth reflected a good balance of volume and net pricing.
Our overall servings increased 3%, with snacks volume growth of 4% and beverage volume growth of 1% on an
organic basis, but our international beverage volume growth was very strong, up 9% on a reported basis and 6% on an
organic basis. More specifically, developing and emerging markets volume was particularly impressive, with snacks
volume growth of 5.5% and beverage volume growth of 7% on an organic basis.
North American Beverages volume was negative, driven by specific decisions we made to take pricing and sustain it
during the quarter.
We had good profit flow-through, with core gross margins improving almost 130 basis points in the quarter, core
constant currency operating profit up 9%, and our core operating margin up more than 80 basis points. Each of our four
business units grew core gross margins, expanded or held core operating margins and grew operating profit. And we
remain focused on cash flow and cash returns. Management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, was more
than $460 million, a significant increase over Q1 2012. In addition, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders in the
quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases, up more than 50% year-over-year.
We're encouraged by the continued strength in the top-line. Innovation was a strong contributor to our overall organic
sales growth and we continued to see positive signs in terms of both improving brand equity scores of our global brands
and market share results. And our productivity program is squarely on track. We've targeted $900 million in savings
this year, which is the second year of our three-year $3 billion productivity program. We are leveraging best-in-class
supply chain activities from around the world. We are increasing automation across the value chain, from raw materials
handling through the route truck. And we are implementing new processing technologies that enable us to both increase
asset utilization and reduce input costs. We are well on our way to achieving our current productivity goal of $3 billion.
And we have our team now focused on identifying and planning the next generation of projects that will extend our
productivity savings well beyond the current program.
With the productivity we're unlocking, we're able to invest in growth drivers, like advertising and new product
launches, and to simultaneously drive margin improvement. This was evident in the first quarter, where A&M expense
increased by 50 basis points, while delivering an 80 basis point improvement in core operating margins.
Turning now to our businesses, let me comment briefly on them in four buckets: Frito-Lay North America; North
American Beverages; all other developed markets businesses; and then developing and emerging markets. Let me begin

with Frito-Lay North America. Frito had a good first quarter. We generated mid-single-digit volume and revenue
growth. And going forward, we expect modest pricing to create a bit more of a spread between volume and revenue
than you saw in the first quarter. We expanded core operating margins by 40 basis points, even as we increased
advertising and marketing expense. More importantly, in Q1, Frito-Lay gained volume, unit and value share across
major channels in the United States.
You know, we feel good about Frito-Lay's growth model, because our business is largely focused on salty snacks. And
we're able to grow by taking occasions from other macro snacks, like cookies, crackers, nuts and seeds. For example,
our Tostitos Cantina is sourcing cracker occasions, while Doritos JACKED is sourcing occasions from microwavable
snacks. Additionally, with our focus on the growing premium snacking occasion, we're realizing additional growth and
profitability. For example, in Q1, Sabra dips grew volumes 16% and Stacy's grew revenue 21%, and both these are
premium offerings, which give us additional space in the produce and deli sections of the grocery stores. So as we look
at Frito, we believe it's in good shape.
Let me turn now to North American Beverages. Our goal in North American Beverages is to judiciously balance share
and profitability. Now this is very important, because we compete in every subcategory of the LRB segment, and any
growth we achieve in one business comes largely at the expense of another subcategory where we also compete. So we
have to be very careful to compete in this large and profitable LRB business in a responsible way, focused more on
innovation and marketing, balancing share and profit. It's our experience that short-term volume-driving activities
merely rent share and is not a value-creating strategy.
Now, let me talk about the category itself and our performance in it. As you all know, about 65% of the category is
non-carbonated beverages and this segment continues to show growth potential. In the first quarter, we had good
performance in teas and chilled juices, ready-to-drink coffee and in sports drinks, all supported by successful
innovation. Our Pure Leaf product under the Lipton trademark, Tropicana Farmstand, Naked, our super-premium
chilled juice, Starbucks Iced Coffee, Starbucks Refreshers, Gatorade chews and shakes, each performed well in the first
quarter, despite less than favorable weather in many parts of the country.
In the other 35% of the LRB category that's CSDs, about 17 points are made up of colas and about 18 points are made
up of flavor CSDs. Within flavor CSDs, Mountain Dew continues to perform well, significantly outperforming the
overall CSD category and gaining four-tenths of a share point in the quarter, bolstered by the launch of Kickstart and
the momentum of Kickstart continued into April.
However, the cola category continues to be a challenge. We took pricing in this declining category and continue to
invest in R&D to break some of the compromises that cause consumers to leave the cola category. While this work
progresses, we are managing the business responsibly and profitably. We're supporting Pepsi with package and product
innovation to drive price utilization and investing appropriately in A&M. And this is what you see reflected in our first
quarter PAB performance. We had good, disciplined net price realization. Our revenue performance was generally in
line with the category. A&M expense increased by 30 basis points versus Q1 of 2012. We expanded core operating
margins by 50 basis points and we grew core constant currency operating profit 4% in the quarter.
So as we go forward, expect us to continue to play a responsible game in North American Beverages, to be competitive
of course, but to also enhance our financial performance. And across the beverage business, we're taking out costs to
drive margin and improve returns under our current structure, while we continue our work to explore sensible
opportunities to unlock incremental value through meaningful structural alternatives. And as we told you on the last
earnings call, we do not intend to talk about this until early next year.
Let me now turn to our other developed markets outside the United States. We saw good performance in some of our
larger markets. The UK had 5% organic revenue growth. Germany was up 8%. France grew 10%, but Western
European macros overall continue to be challenging and we expect they'll continue to put pressure on consumer
spending going forward.
Emerging and developing markets, we saw very good growth in these markets in Q1, with organic revenue growth of
12%, made up of 14% in snacks and 9% in beverages, driven by execution of our strategies to increase household

penetration and frequency of consumption. We had terrific growth across each of our major developing markets, with
organic revenue growth of 6% in Mexico, 8% in Turkey and 12% in Brazil. And our emerging markets performance
drove the continued great results in our AMEA sector, where organic volume grew double digits in each of snacks and
beverages and organic revenue grew 15%.
Within our emerging markets, organic revenue was especially strong in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Vietnam and the
Philippines, with each growing in excess of 20% and organic revenue grew 19% in Jordan and 18% in Egypt. And
China performed especially well, with organic volume growth of 17% in beverages and 47% in snacks. Importantly, we
also saw a nice improvement in core operating margins in AMEA, with a 450 basis point increase, even as we continue
to invest in brand-building and capacity to drive future growth.
So overall, we feel good about the state of the business and our first quarter performance. Top-line was strong. We
continue to invest in our brands to fuel growth. Productivity is on track and we saw solid core operating margin
improvement and core operating profit growth. With the strength of the first quarter's performance, we have an even
greater degree of confidence in delivering our 2013 financial guidance in a global macroeconomic environment that
continues to be volatile.
To summarize, PepsiCo is performing well. We are growing the top and bottom-line and driving margins and cash
returns. We are being disciplined and responsible, across the board, in balancing value share and profitability. And the
overall portfolio is working in terms of scale, geographic reach and product diversity, covering snacks and beverages
and different day parts, need states and cohorts.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh.
Hugh F. Johnston
Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I'll spend just a minute covering the financial results and guidance in a
little more detail and then we'll open the lines to your questions. For Q1, organic volume grew 4% in snacks and 1% in
beverages, with international organic volumes up 6% in beverages and 5% in snacks. Organic revenue grew 4.4%. Our
core gross margins improved by about 130 basis points and we reinvested almost 50 basis points in A&M. Core
operating margin improved by 80 basis points and core constant currency operating profit grew 9%. Net interest
expense increased by $12 million, reflecting higher debt balances. Our core effective tax rate was 24.5%,
approximately 220 basis points below Q1, 2012. And core constant currency EPS grew 13%.
So between core constant currency division operating profit growth of 7% and core constant currency EPS growth of
13%, we got about six points of leverage: one point from corporate unallocated, some of which is timing-related; slight
leverage from net interest expense; three points from tax rate, which will reverse, as we're forecasting the full-year rate
to come in at approximately 27%; and one point from weighted average share count, which was down 1% year-on-year.
Overall, the quarter came in as expected, with pricing actions, commodity inflation and productivity all in line with our
expectations.
On a reported basis, net revenue was up 1%, and that was driven by a half-point drag from ForEx and a three point
negative impact from structural change, reflecting the China refranchising. And reported operating profit and EPS
included the $111 million net monetary asset write-down in Venezuela that we talked about on the Q4 call.
We generated over $700 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter, a $1.4 billion positive swing versus last
year. This was driven by lower pension contributions, stronger working capital improvements and a reduction in net
capital spending. Management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, was $464 million, an increase of $385
million over Q1 of last year. And we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders this quarter in the form of dividends and
share repurchases, a 52% increase year-over-year.
Now turning to guidance, for 2013, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7% off a core 2012 base of $4.10.
More specifically, we expect organic revenue growth of mid-single-digits, core constant currency operating profit
growth of approximately 6% and approximately one point of leverage below the operating profit line, driven by share

repurchases, offset somewhat by higher net interest expense of approximately $90 million from higher debt balances.
And we expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full-year.
Within these expectations, we assume positive price mix, low single-digit commodity inflation, productivity of $900
million and A&M growing at least in line with our net revenue growth. Our productivity assumption is completely in
line with the three-year $3 billion program that we launched last year and the savings will be used to help offset
inflation, as well as to provide funding for investment back into the business.
One of our key investment areas is supporting our brands with advertising and marketing, where we will grow A&M
investment at least in line with net sales, meaning you should expect A&M spending of at least 5.7% of sales, which
was our 2012 baseline investment. In addition, we're also accelerating our investment in R&D and innovation. Based
on current market consensus, we anticipate foreign exchange translation to have approximately a one point negative
impact on our net revenue, operating profit and EPS for the full-year, including the impact of the Venezuela
devaluation. Our ForEx outlook is marginally more negative than what we shared with you on the Q4 call, but still
rounding to 1%, at this point. And we anticipate structural changes will have a negative impact on our full-year net
revenue growth of approximately one point, driven by China and Vietnam.
Overall, we're pleased with how the first quarter came in and that increases our confidence in delivering our full-year
guidance. I'd encourage you not to increase your estimates, however. The world remains a volatile place and we may
also choose to incrementally invest in the long-term value-building initiatives, such as advertising, innovation and in
emerging markets' growth capacity.
As you model out the second quarter, we expect foreign exchange translation to have up to a negative two point impact
on second quarter revenue and EPS, based on current market consensus rates. We expect revenue in the second quarter
will have an estimated one point negative impact from structural changes, due to the beverage refranchisings, both
China and our recently announced refranchising of Vietnam. We'll also have a gain on the Vietnam transaction, which
we intend to reinvest in the business, so we don't expect it to have any impact on our full-year earnings guidance.
Commodity inflation will ramp up sequentially from the first quarter, but our full-year outlook remains unchanged
from our original guidance of low single digits.
In Europe, given the timing of expenses and continued challenges in Western Europe, the Europe sector's operating
profit performance may moderate from the Q1 performance. And we expect higher A&M expense will negatively
impacted margins around the – across the business. From a cash flow perspective, we expect full-year core
management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $7 billion. We'll continue to drive cash flow
through even more efficient working capital management and continued tight controls over capital spending. And for
2013, we expect to see continued improvement in our key working capital metrics and to manage net capital spending
to approximately $3 billion, which is well within our long-term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.
As a result, we'll continue to return strong cash flow to our shareholders. In total, we expect to return approximately
$6.4 billion to shareholders in 2013, $3.4 billion in dividends and $3 billion share repurchases. Net, our outlook for
2013 is consistent with our long-term targets for net revenue, operating profit and core constant currency EPS. We
expect to drive improved margins and net ROIC. And generating and returning cash flow to our shareholders remains a
top priority for the company.
So with that, operator, we'll take the first question.

<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Just a question on the operating leverage in the quarter, and I don't know how difficult that it's
going to be to kind of parse this out, but just trying to get a sense for how much of it was driven just simply by
commodity disinflation? How much of it is driven by the pricing actions, I guess, in Latin America Foods and in
Americas Beverages? And then, how much of it is you're actually beginning to see more of the productivity drop to the
bottom-line? So I'm just trying to get a sense for when we look at the margin expansion in the quarter and try to look at
it going forward, just the weightings in terms of what those items contributed to the margin expansion.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Hugh, go ahead.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, Bryan, obviously, we're getting into a fair amount of detail and in a global P&L, it's a
little bit difficult to parse all of that. No doubt, they were all contributing factors. We clearly did have some pricing in
excess of inflation for the quarter, but we also got more than our share of the $900 million of productivity in the quarter
and that was flowing through, as well. Instead of breaking the specific pieces down, what we really try to do is just give
you guidance on what we expect the outputs to be and at least give you a sense for the difference between what's
happening in gross margin and what's happening in operating margin. What I would just say is both price in excess of
commodity as well as productivity were significant contributors to the margin expansion.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan Chase.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, John.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit, Indra, on your comments on
North America, I guess, if we look at the Scanner Data pricing, which is really what we have to work with, your pricing
in CSDs accelerated a little bit through the quarter. And on a two year basis, you're ahead of both of your largest
competitors in terms of pricing in CSDs. And I guess the big concern, given the weak volume number is, profits
without a balanced algorithm really are not sustainable and people would argue that's one of the things that got you in
the hole that you were in heading into 2012.
So how do we think about that balance going forward? Because to Bryan's point, the leverage looks good, but the
viewpoint's going to be that it's not sustainable and you're going to have to drive some of that back in order to get the
volume moving. So any sort of follow up there?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: John, I tell you, that's a great question. You know in the last call, I think we talked about Q1
always being sort of a funny quarter, because all the weather-related impacts hit us on Q1. So it's very hard to read the
year from Q1 alone, but, having said that, let me tell you that we look very carefully at this trade-off between volume,
pricing and profit. We look at it constantly. And we began the year saying we've got to take pricing and we've got to
stick to this because this is a category where you've got to behave in a very responsible and a consistent way so that you
don't destroy value in a business that requires reinvention. That's the way we approached it.
We saw some interesting pricing activity in the first five or six weeks of the quarter. And in the second half of the
quarter, we started to put in the right actions on pricing, very granular, very targeted, still with an eye towards
profitability to make sure that we balanced volume, revenue and profitability very carefully. And if you look at the last
six weeks or the last nine weeks, the performance was very different.
So believe me, John, your point is exceedingly well taken. We are treading this thing very, very carefully, but at the end
of the day, I think this industry requires responsible behavior. And we're going to try to make sure that we play this
carbs/non-carbs portfolio very carefully, while getting ready for this reinvention of carbonated soft drinks. So we will
continue to play this game where we don't allow volume declines for the balance of the year to be at the magnitude of
the first quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: On the – on some of your emerging market or developing market performance, I guess it's been
now a few quarters where your profitability is starting to really ramp up. So can you just give us some perspective on
the sustainability of that kind of profit improvement, your level of investment that's going into those markets, and the
potential for continued, I guess, profitability improvement? How much of that is going to really drive your overall
profit growth performance?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Judy, emerging and developing markets have been growing robustly from a GDP perspective.
And the differential between developed markets and emerging and developing markets tends to be about between three
and six points in terms of GDP growth. So if you look across the world, emerging developing markets have robust
growth. That's the macroeconomic factor. Over the past five or six years, as you well know, we've been investing to
shift our portfolio to be more balanced between emerging and developing markets and developed markets because prior
to 2006, we tended to be more of a developed market, predominantly U.S.-based company. So the last six years, we've
been working very hard to diversify the portfolio.
So what you're beginning to see right now is a result of all those investments beginning to pay off bit by bit. When you
first make the investment, it is dilutive to profitability, but you have to make those investments. Between M&A and
organic investments, we had to do it. Now, bit by bit, as developed markets don't grow as robustly as they did pre-2005
and as the developing and emerging market investments start to pay off, the combination is beginning to yield results.
Now if you're asking for a projection, I mean, that's very hard to give you a projection. All that I'll tell you is the overall
PepsiCo algorithm works, because we have this nice mix of developed and developing and emerging markets, and as
margin improves in those markets and developed markets also continue to grow, the overall portfolio works. The
overall financial profile works.

<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi. How are you?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Very good. Thank you.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Good. Wanted to ask a little bit about this balancing act that is certainly going on in North America,
it sounds like successfully, particularly on North American CSDs, where you are seeing volume is what volume is.
We're going to try to do better, but it is what it is. And we're going to try to drive profitability to try to...
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: The question being, Ali?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: I think he's asking the balancing act between profit and market share.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Yeah. Go ahead.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah. So, Ali, I guess what I would say is this. As Indra mentioned in her opening remarks,
we are basically trying to do two things. Number one, we want to make sure that we ensure our competitiveness. And
that's something that we think is important for the long-term of the business. At the same time, we do think that this is a

– it's a good business. It's a business that generates a lot of cash flow. And obviously, we're looking for it to generate
profit growth as it did in Q1, with PAB delivering 4% profit growth, which is certainly a positive, I think, in the
industry.
The balancing act that we're ultimately going to manage to is ensuring that within the categories, we are being smart
about how we manage each of the categories, where we choose to gain share, where we choose to hold share. The
second thing that we're going to be doing is we will be playing a price package game to ensure that we do look to
across the package portfolio to get price realization where we can. And in that vein, one of the things that you know
we're doing this year is what we called our Hybrid EDV, which is to try to balance out holiday and non-holiday pricing
to try to send the message to consumers that not to buy only when the product is deeply discounted.
And then obviously, the last decision that we've made is a decision to invest in research and development to address
some of the core dissatisfiers with some of the products, with the belief that innovation is the way really to create
sustainable value in the category. And I think that's what we're looking to do in the North American Beverage space
and we think it's a successful strategy.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: And, Ali, the other thing as we talked in our earnings call, it's interesting, because the North
American Beverages, we participate in every sub-segment of the North American Beverage business. So we have to be
careful that we don't take too much – take pricing down too much in one category and source from a more profitable
part of the other subcategory. So we have to make sure we play this overall category game very, very carefully. And
because we've owned operating businesses around the world in snacks, we are very, very cognizant of how you play the
game in a big operating business. It's very different from playing the game in a franchise business. And we have
volumes of learnings from around the world from our various operating businesses. And I think we are borrowing a
page from that playbook to participate in this NAB – in the North American Beverage business.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: So, Hugh, given the 9% core profit growth in Q1, despite the 11% ad increase, your
full-year guidance implies a few hundred basis point slowdown at least in the balance of the year on core profit growth.
And I know you mentioned commodities get worse, but I was hoping for a bit more detail on why you'd expect that
level of deceleration. And also, can you quantify what you're expecting on commodities in the balance of the year
relative to Q1?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, so I think a couple of things to keep in mind on that, Dara. The first and probably the
biggest factor is the world's certainly a volatile place and as we look forward into the balance of the year, we're
certainly thinking about our guidance in the context of the world being a volatile place and, at the same time, ensuring
that we deliver our guidance, through thick and thin, in terms of the challenges that we might face.
The second piece to consider is, given that we have seen some success in terms of moving the top-line with investments
that we've made in the business, we're only going to do things that we view as creating sustainable shareholder value,
but to the degree that there are opportunities to invest in the business to create sustainable shareholder value, we're
obviously going to be looking towards doing that, as well.
And then the last piece, I talked about core division operating profit growth of 7% for the quarter and core division
operating profit growth of 6% for the year. So that's about a one point gap and, frankly, with the timing of A&M
expenses, with the timing of commodities, that gap isn't so large that just sort of the general quarterly movements in
those expenses would move the number from a 7% to a 6% in a relatively un-disruptive way. So that's basically how
we get there and hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense of the context as to how we're thinking about it, as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Are you there?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Bill.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Oh, good. Thanks. Hi. Can you just give us some color on the organic growth rates in some of
the bigger countries, so: Russia; China, ex the Tingyi partnership; Brazil and Mexico; and then maybe Gatorade on the
organic side, too? And then the second part of the question is maybe how March is looking in some of the international
markets because I know the books close in February, so maybe some update on what kind of happened in March and
what your view is going forward.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: So organic growth, pretty much in every one of those markets, was strong and we talked about
it in our earnings script. China volume grew, organic revenue grew. If you look at the UK, you look at Russia, you look
at every country, pretty much across the board, we had organic revenue growth, whether it was developed or
developing. I don't think there was any country around the world, Bill, where we did not have some organic growth. So
we feel good about the growth rates, even though many of those international markets were just two months. India
grew 9%. Egypt grew 20%. Saudi grew 21%. Pakistan grew 37%. I could go on and on, but every one of these
countries grew mid-single-digits or even in the 20s or 30s, so good revenue performance across the board.
The first quarter is a two month quarter. It is the lowest – the smallest quarter in the year and so the costs and the profits
are not fully balanced. So what I'd say to you is that we had very good gross margins. In AMEA, for example, we had a
438 gross margin – a basis point improvement in gross margins, but it's a small quarter, so let's wait and see how that
evolves through the year. But all that I'd tell you is Latin America, AMEA, doing well, margins expanding, profits
growing well, Russia doing well. Western Europe, we're going to watch and wait and see what happens to the
macroeconomic environment. And North America, we've talked enough about it. So overall, I'd say it's a good outlook
for our developing and emerging markets.

Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
<Q - Caroline Shan Levy>: Good morning. Thanks. I wonder if you could actually, just the last part of the last
question was around Gatorade and Trop and talk about the strategy for this year and longer term, the repositioning that
happened at Gatorade and what the volume was like this quarter.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Oh, I'm sorry. I am sorry, Bill, that I didn't answer that Gatorade and Tropicana part. And,
Caroline, thank you very much for asking that question again. Actually, Gatorade and Tropicana had very good
quarters. And sequentially, the performance is sustaining itself. Again, as you well know, in Gatorade, we are playing a
sports nutrition game between Gatorade juice, Gatorade hydration and Gatorade recover. And as a system, that business
is doing well. We are staying very true to our premium sports nutrition positioning and we continue to play the game
that way. We are beginning to gain share in sports nutrition, even though we had low-priced competition come in with
a really aggressive pricing. We held our ground and we're beginning to gain share, so we feel very good about our
sports nutrition strategy.
In the case of Tropicana, between Tropicana Trop50, you know the Tropicana franchise also includes Naked, but let me
just speak to Tropicana. Again, coming out of the first part of Q1 going to the second part and now going into Q2, we
are beginning to gain share in the chilled juiced category. Just a lot of great advertising, incredible execution focus in
all of our traditional strongholds and we are seeing impressive performance gains in Tropicana. And just look for us to
grow the Naked franchise, continue to bring innovation into the Tropicana franchise. And the launch of Tropicana

Farmstand, which is a fruit and vegetable product, is also doing very, very well. So continue to look for innovation
from Tropicana. We feel good about the tailwinds that those categories have, because they're more in the nutrition
space, coupled with the fact that our brands are very strong.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Mark. How are you?
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Morning, Indra. I'm good. Thank you. Two-part question, it looks like in C-stores, there's
an increasing divergence between what you're seeing on the snack side of your business and the beverage component of
your business. And, as you say, we've only got two months here, so perhaps on the beverage side, we should not make
too much of that. Can you speak to how accurate that assessment is and kind of what kind of promise these tie-ins with
AB and the promotions you have kind of incrementally from a Power of One perspective, how you feel they might
address that issue? And then kind of related to that, but could we speak a little bit more about how this large format
effort on the promotional side, changing the promotional calendars, is actually going? It sounds like the aim is good
and you've had some success to an extent, but perhaps the pace of success in terms of getting that better promotional
environment is a little slower than you would've thought about a year ago?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Convenience stores in the first quarter, especially the first part of the first quarter, perhaps not a
very good performing channel. I wouldn't say – you're talking about our business. As a channel, convenience stores do
not perform very well, because weather impacted convenience stores significantly. And you can't do anything about
Mother Nature. So convenience stores didn't perform well, but now as the weather is improving across the country, a
little bit slower than we'd like, because snow in the West in April doesn't feel that good, but we are seeing trends
improve in convenience stores. And we are very strong in convenience stores, both in beverages and snacks, and we're
beginning to see sequential improvement.
And because of the underperformance in the first part of Q1 of the channel itself, and now that we're seeing sequential
improvement, we think the year for C-stores will still end up with sort of 3.5%, 4% growth in the channel. And if the
channel grows at that rate, you should expect to see good performance from PepsiCo in that channel. And I'll be honest
with you. The divergence between snacks and beverages is not that much. Both our businesses are doing fairly well in
the convenience stores, and I think that as the year goes on, you'll start to see better performance in the convenience
store channel.
And in terms of – Hugh, you wanted to add something there?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, if I can just particularly to the convenience store piece as well, as Indra mentioned,
the weather lap in convenience is particularly challenging for beverages. We had a particularly warm winter last year,
lapping that now with a really long, extended winter. That's just going to have a more natural effect on beverages than
it will on the snacks business. And I think the divergence that you're referring to can be more attributed to that than it
can be to anything else. It's also indicated in the overall performance of the convenience channel, which was down
obviously in the first quarter. And as Indra mentioned, we expect the full-year, that channel to be up 3.5%, 4%. So we
don't normally like to use weather as much of a conversation piece, but I think, in this case, because it's just so stark,
and it does have such a significant impact on that channel in that particular set of businesses, it is a relevant factor.

<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: Hi. I just had a follow-up on the C-store channel and then Frito-Lay. I was actually hoping you
could give us a little more color on some of the new initiatives in this channel, such as your individual store planograms
that you've started to implement, curious to hear how broad-based this initiative will be. And then maybe could you talk
about any other changes you've been making in the important channel?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Frito-Lay has always had the convenience store as a very, very strong go-to-market outlet and
it continues to be that way. Frito had terrific performance in Q1 and to get to that level of detail on how individual store
planograms are working, Bonnie, my suggestion is, at some point, if you want to visit Frito-Lay and get a better sense
for what they're doing in C-stores, we invite you to do that.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: In addition to that, Bonnie, I don't know that what's going on is as much
planogram-oriented. We obviously have made the move with certain packages in terms of moving into a larger
value-line size and in addition to that, we've got some terrific innovation out in convenience stores and that innovation
obviously really does help Frito-Lay. It is so sensitive to flavor innovation and convenience is where you tend to get a
lot of trial on that stuff early on and so, frankly, it's out of the blocks really well, and we feel very, very good about it.

Your next question comes from the line of Damian Witkowski with Gabelli & Company.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Damian.
<Q - Damian Witkowski>: Good morning. Indra, in the past, you have called the U.S. pricing environment probably
one of the more – most irrational you've seen in any industry. And I'm wondering if you've changed your mind about
that, with what happened over the last couple of years, and pricing seeming to be a little bit more rational. And then the
second part is are we seeing any of that in the international markets, especially ones that are growing and getting
bigger?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I think, Damian, that I made that comment a couple of years ago when pricing was crazy, but
I'd say that I wouldn't say that it's become rational. I'd say in bursts it becomes irrational. And I think if we continue to
focus just on volume, and maniacally on volume, I'm talking most about beverages. If you only focus on volume
growth, it does lead to some irrational pricing, especially when quarters have to end or when people are trying to make
some volume numbers just to report something good.
I think in this LRB category, in particular, it's very, very important we thread volume and value very, very carefully. It's
a big profitable category, and we run the risk of sucking the profits out if we don't play this game responsibly. So that's
the tack we've chosen to take and I hope that's how the industry gets played out. We see bursts of responsible behavior,
then, at times, we see action that we can't even explain. But I guess this is part of free markets and competition. So we
keep playing this.

America CSDs, to then take that and invest in parts of the global business that are actually growing more robustly, so
emerging markets, snacks in the emerging markets, in particular? Is that the model you guys explicitly think about and
talk about internally, like some other CPG companies and retail companies do, or is that just more organic in the way
it's been happening?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Ali, actually, that's a very insightful observation, because I think every company needs – and if
you go back to the old Growth-Share Matrix that Boston Consulting came up with, I think, in the 1960s or the 1970s,
you're really talking about how you have some cash cows to go off and invest in big growth stars, and that's how we all
have to play the portfolio, because a portfolio is completely comprised of growth vehicles. You can't sustain the
investment. You do need some cash cows to be able to invest in growth engines.
Having said that, I think that mature, low-growth businesses, especially if they're big and have consumer appeal, are
also ripe for reinvention. And I think it's very important that established players reinvent their categories, as opposed to
allowing others to reinvent it and push them out. And there are examples, many, many examples of big companies,
especially companies based here in the U.S., that did not reinvent their categories. So I think we adopted a – behave
responsibly, generate the cash in the North American business, grow responsibly, invest for international growth, but
reinvent North America simultaneously, which is why we stepped up all our R&D investments in sweeteners, flavoring
agents, new processing technologies.
Unfortunately, the timing is a bit off, because R&D projects don't result in major breakthroughs in the same timeframe
with which you can manage responsibly. So you've got to give it a little bit more time to yield results. So you're
absolutely right in saying you've got to play the overall portfolio carefully. And what I feel good about the PepsiCo
portfolio, we have a very good mix of growth businesses, businesses that generate cash and good returns to keep
funding this growth. And I think our portfolio is so well balanced, in terms of snacks, beverages, geographic mix,
different growth rates, that we're able to manage it sensibly and deliver the kind of profit that I think this portfolio is
capable of generating well into the future.

That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Indra for any closing comments.
Indra K. Nooyi
Thank you, all. In closing, I'd just like to say that we are pleased with the way we are navigating through an uncertain
and volatile environment. We've taken all the steps necessary to strengthen and position ourselves for sustainable
long-term growth. I think the first quarter of 2013 is an excellent example of how a well constructed and developed
portfolio, coupled with disciplined execution and reinvestment, can drive high-quality, top and bottom-line results.
So I thank you for your time and for the confidence you've placed in us with your investments. Have a great day.
