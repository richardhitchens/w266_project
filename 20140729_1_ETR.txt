MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Please, stand by, we are about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Second Quarter
2014 Earnings Release Conference. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference
over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Paula Waters. Please, go ahead.
Paula Waters
Good morning and thank you for joining us. We'll begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO, Leo

economic development or job creation and everyone wants to be part of a brighter, more prosperous future. I'm pleased
to say that in the second quarter of 2014 this focus allowed us to deliver our commitments to all four of our
stakeholders, our owners, customers, employees and the communities we serve. Weather aside, results in the second
quarter were largely consistent with our expectations and I suspect with yours. The state of Entergy's business is strong.
At the Utility, we saw strong industrial sales growth. All of our operating companies improved by several points in the
Annual J.D. Power Residential Customer Satisfaction Survey. River Bend earned an excellence rating for its
operations, joining Indian Point, which earned the same rating in the first quarter. At EWC, the nuclear fleet delivered
fewer outage days allowing us to provide extended periods of uninterrupted power to the market. This kind of
excellence, which we see from our plants to our corporate operations is driven by the determination and dedication of
Entergy employees and I'd like to take a minute here to acknowledge that hard work and to say thank you.
Many of you on this call heard us present our growth objectives at Analyst Day on June 5. We continue to see a path to
achieving each of these including the consolidated earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 2% to 4%
through 2016, which is based on our point of view of market prices. In the second quarter, we continued to position the
company for this growth. Let me address how we did so, beginning with the Utility.
The big story for us at the Utility continues to be the economic growth in our service area, and all of us at Entergy are
doing our part to both drive and leverage this growth. As I mentioned earlier, industrial sales increased
quarter-over-quarter resulting in a growth rate of more than 5%, which included expansions. At Analyst Day we said
that we believe the opportunity of 1,700 megawatts through 2016. At the end of the second quarter, we had completed
negotiations of approximately 1,200 megawatts. This includes about 100 megawatts signed since June. We expect to
see this trajectory continue through the end of the year and well into decade's end. We anticipate that meeting this
growing demand will require significant capital needs over and above current levels but it will also require a focus on
four areas.
First, as I said earlier, safe, secure and reliable power; second, an efficient operation responsive to customer needs;
third, financial strength and stability; and fourth, regulatory frameworks that allow us to expand the system to meet
anticipated demand. Starting with the first item on the list, we continue to invest in our infrastructure to ensure that we
are able to safely deliver power to all of our customers, even in difficult circumstances. As we've said before, we'll be
deploying nearly $6 billion through 2016 on generation, transmission and distribution systems throughout the Utility.
We intend to make this investment while keeping electricity affordable. As many of you know, historically, Entergy's
rates have been about 20% below the national average. And these low rates benefit our industrial customers just as
much as families and the communities we serve.
Moving to item two on the list, we continue to look for ways to become a nimbler, more efficient organization. This
was the impetus behind the company-wide restructuring we announced last year, which by 2016 will have removed
$200 million to $250 million in costs company-wide. We're also working hard on all fronts to support low-growth in
Utility infrastructure needs. For example, as part of that restructuring, we created a new department whose sole mission
is to manage capital projects, to ensure that they are planned, implemented and finished in a timely and efficient
manner. We're expanding resources for functions central to our strategy of economic development and nuclear
oversight. We are also streamlining back office functions.
Partly as a result of this reinvigorated focus, our plans at the Utility remain on track as are efforts to make our business
even more reliable, effective and efficient. For example, in May to ensure reliable, affordable power, as well as to
respond to the state's evolving generation landscape, Entergy Arkansas issued an RFP for 200 megawatts to 600
megawatts of long-term resources beginning in 2017. No self-build options are being considered, and selections are
targeted for November. In July, we issued an RFP for 650 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts beginning in 2020 in the
Amite South planning region in Southeast Louisiana. As part of the RFP, we will be testing a self-build option at our
existing Little Gypsy site. Proposals are targeted for November. You may remember that a few years ago, the
550-megawatt Ninemile 6 plant was selected through a similar process. Barring unforeseen circumstances, this, the first
new combined-cycle natural gas-fired plant to be built by the Utility, should be completed by the end of the year. We
want to be in a position to replicate this success and are working to ensure that we will be.

In transmission, we're in the process of evaluating potential projects to help us connect new industrial customers,
expand our capacity to serve the load and enhance the economics of providing safe, secure, reliable power. We're also
working to finalize our annual long-term transmission reliability plan for submission to MISO.
Moving to the third area, financial strength gives us the flexibility to expand our system, to meet step-out industrial
growth. For example, last month Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a study that included a
preliminary analysis of combining the two companies. As we expected, the study showed that a larger company would
improve the financial flexibility of the Louisiana companies and help finance investment required to serve new
industrial customers. For our regulators, a combined company would save millions of dollars in administrative costs.
The added geographic and customer diversity of a consolidated company will also help it withstand storms and
sector-specific economic downturns.
This leads me to the fourth area of focus, regulatory frameworks. For some time now, we have been working with our
regulators to find ways to streamline processes and identify new regulatory mechanisms that benefit current and
potential customers as well as Entergy. Two examples of these would be riders and certification mechanisms that our
regulators have had in place for many years and regulatory tools used at other utilities like forward test years. We are
pleased to say that the second quarter saw progress on this front. In June, for the first time in 12 years, Entergy
Mississippi filed a general rate case.
This multi-faceted plan is designed to position our Mississippi service territory for economic growth and development
by improving reliability, modernizing the grid, stabilizing rates and implementing new technologies. From a
ratemaking perspective, Entergy Mississippi has proposed revisions to the formula rate plan to use a forward test year,
which will help bring transmission service to some of Mississippi's most attractive industrial sites. EMI has also
proposed several rate incentives for industries and small businesses, all of which are designed to support job creation.
All these items, safe, reliable power, operational efficiency, financial strength and regulatory frameworks are just some
examples of how we are executing our plan to support economic growth across our four-state Utility service territory.
Turning now to EWC. As I mentioned earlier, our financial results for the quarter reflect strong operational
performance as well as higher power prices. As you know, our strategy is to preserve the optionality and manage the
risk in this commodity-based business. As we saw again, commodity prices are volatile. Overall, from March 31
through June 30, average 2015 and 2016 forward prices for New York Zone G and New England's Mass Hub increased
an average of $3.81 per megawatt hour peaking on June 3.
Since June 30, prices for those two years are off by 9%. While short-term power and natural gas markets have not been
constructive due to recent production gains and mild summer weather, long-term market fundamentals, as discussed at
Analyst Day, remain sound. In addition to a robust long-term demand picture for natural gas, starting next year we see
a wave of older coal unit retirements coupled with higher pricing for CO2 under the Northeast Regional Pact, continued
power volatility during constrained periods, long-term load recovery and the potential for lower-than-expected energy
efficiency gains. All of these factors will likely lift power prices to higher levels than indicated by current forwards in
2016 and beyond. For these reasons among others, we remain both resolute and optimistic about the future.
On the capacity side, ISO New England is implementing a downward sloping demand curve in next February's auction
for the 2018 to 2019 capability period. This will help provide appropriate incentives to ensure that existing economic
capacity continues to operate and that new capacity is constructed to ensure reliability.
With respect to Indian Point, in June, the New York ISO released a draft of its Biennial Reliability Needs Assessment.
For the fourth report in a row the ISO found that Indian Point is critical to maintaining the reliability of the grid in New
York and that its closure would cause transmission problems and worsen existing risk of outages beyond acceptable
levels. It should be no surprise to anyone that for a variety of reasons Indian Point is and will remain a critical part of
the generation mix of New York, and we are committed to ensuring its continued safe operation.
I'm now going to turn to some significant developments on the environmental front. The past three months have seen a
lot of activity on issues ranging from air to water quality. In April, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's Cross-State Air Pollution Rules, which were introduced in 2011. In May, after

several delays, the EPA issued the final 316(b) cooling water intake regulation revisions and in June the agency
released the proposed rule on carbon emissions from existing units. The CSAPR and 316(b) rules will have some effect
in our operations, and while we are still studying the specifics, we believe them to be manageable.
I know that the proposed rule on carbon has been getting a lot of attention. So let me spend a little bit of time on that.
As you know, Entergy's overall fleet, both Utility and EWC, is one of the cleanest in the nation. In fact, our fleet
exceeds EPA guidelines for new build power plants, which mandate that new natural gas plants emit no more than
1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. Today, Entergy's fleet emits about 580 pounds per megawatt hour
driven largely by the prevalence of nuclear power, clear evidence that carbon reduction goals cannot be met without
maintaining the nation's nuclear generation capacity. The proposed rule governs emissions state by state and for this
reason is arguably the most complex regulation EPA has proposed in recent history. We continue to study it and its
potential implications, and we continue to have productive discussions with EPA staff.
However, our concern is that the implementation of the rule, that is its impact, would not match the agency's stated
objectives. So at this point, we have more questions than answers. And I think it's fair to say, this is a point that is
shared across the industry. The public comment period on the proposed rule closes October 16. And by that time we
expect to have a crystallized point of view. We plan to present that perspective to the EPA as well as our stakeholders,
including those of you on this call. So stay tuned.
In closing, I want to reiterate that we believe the future of our business is strong. Our plans are structured to facilitate
growth at our Utility and to take advantage of the optionality inherent in our nuclear fleet. At Analyst Day, we detailed
our near-term objectives, what we believe we can achieve financially and operationally to help grow our economies,
support job creation, help maintain and improve the environment and enhance and replace infrastructure to improve
reliability. There are a number of building blocks to this vision, some we control, some we do not.
So it's worth noting that our business is by nature volatile in the short-term. However, this short-term volatility should
not and does not change our confidence in the long-term fundamentals. The classic example is the recent steep drop in
natural gas prices driven mainly by weather. This has not changed our longer-term bullish views. As such, we continue
to see a line of sight to our three-year Entergy EPS growth outlook.
Other factors affecting our business include the timing of complex industrial projects, evolving policy landscapes in our
states as well as in Washington, and of course the weather. Again, the fundamentals are strong even with this
uncertainty. At the Utility with respect to industrial projects that support growth, some will move more quickly than
anticipated, and some may be delayed. For example, Big River Steel got its financing and permitting this past quarter
and is moving ahead. We had originally anticipated Big River to be completed in 2015. Now it looks like it will be
2016.
At EWC, rising demand for natural gas and shrinking reserve margins, combined with infrastructure constraints and the
region's growing need for environmentally and economically sustainable reliable power point to higher value for our
EWC nuclear portfolio.
Despite such uncertainty, we know the shale revolution will continue for far into the foreseeable future to drive
competitive U.S. natural gas prices and liquid prices relative to the rest of the world. So we can be confident, as indeed
we are, that whatever the particulars in our service territories, the stage is set for significant economic growth. And as
I've said a number of times already, we are doing everything we can to make that growth happen.
So today, as it has been for more than a century, Entergy's business is a long-term play. Over the years we have prided
ourselves on delivering strong value for our stakeholders, including a long history of dividend payments and growth to
our owners. Results in the second quarter are further evidence of this and the progress we've made on many fronts over
the past 18 months. But I also want to say that we are committed to ensuring that short-term volatility does not
compromise the long-term health of the business or that of our stakeholders. A lot of the initiatives we undertook
during the second quarter are also a good demonstration of that.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew, who will review our financial performance for the quarter and update you on
our three-year outlook.

Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. Today I will review the financial results for the quarter as well as our
forward-looking outlook. Starting with slide two, our second quarter results for the current year and prior years are
shown on an as reported and on operational basis. Operational earnings per share were $1.11 in the second quarter of
2014 compared to $1.01 in 2013. Operational results excluded special items from the decision to close Vermont
Yankee, HCM implementation and the transmission spin-merge effort last year.
Turning to operational results on slide three, Entergy's operational earnings increase was driven primarily by higher
earnings at EWC. Parent & Other earnings were flat and at Utility, operational earnings per share were $1.17, $0.01
lower than a year ago. There are a few key offsetting drivers. For the quarter, Utility net revenue was a positive driver.
Retail sales growth for the quarter was 2.1% or 2.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. The industrial customer class had the
strongest gains of 5.3%. Industrial growth was broad-based across multiple segments led by refining, chemicals and
small industrials and aided by several expansions. Increases within ETI and EGSL service areas drove industrial
growth. Sales growth was offset by the effects of weather, including milder than normal weather in this quarter's
unbilled period. The quarterly net revenue increase also reflected higher price resulting from rate actions. Portion of the
price increase was offset by other line items.
Despite the spending increases offset in net revenue, non-fuel O&M was favorable quarter-over-quarter reflecting our
cost management efforts. Improvements from net revenue and O&M were offset by higher depreciation expense and
higher effective income tax rates.
Now moving on to EWC, EWC's operational earnings per share of $0.18 was higher than the $0.07 earned a year ago.
EWC EBITDA for the quarter, summarized on slide four, was $84 million higher than last year. The increase is due to
higher net revenue from improved sales volume, following continued operational improvement in our merchant nuclear
fleet. This is illustrated by a stellar 95% nuclear fleet capacity factor for the quarter, versus 82% in 2013.
Unplanned outage days were dramatically reduced by 37 days, and there were no refueling outage days in the second
quarter of this year. The average realized price for EWC's nuclear fleet also improved to just under $50 per megawatt
hour, compared to $46.40 a year ago, or about 7% higher. The price increase was largely due to capacity prices, while
energy prices were relatively flat.
Now, moving on to operating cash flow shown on slide five. OCF was $761 million in the current quarter, up $189
million from 2013. Higher net revenue from EWC was the largest driver.
I'll now turn to forward-looking information. In today's release, we affirmed our 2014 operational earnings per share
guidance range of $5.55 to $6.75, based on results through the second quarter and June 30th forward prices, our current
expectations point to just below the midpoint of the range due largely to mild weather in the second quarter.
As we think about the remainder of 2014, there are a few things we are paying close attention to. For EWC, we have
seen market boards for the balance of the year come down since June 30. There are also open regulatory proceedings
that could see resolution this year at Utility. For example, the Waterford 3 steam generator prudence review is currently
in process.
On the call last quarter, we also discussed expectations for incremental opportunistic 2014 O&M spending aimed at
accelerating projects, improving top line growth and improving operational performance and reliability to benefit
customers. Identified opportunities have fallen more into the improvement categories, but are generally consistent with
the amounts outlined last quarter. EWC spending is a little lower than discussed last quarter, while Utility spending is a
little higher.
Now let's turn to 2015. For the past several years on this call, we provided a few thoughts for prompt year earnings.
Following that practice, slide six summarizes considerations for next year. The issues are probably what most of you
expect, a few things of note. At the Utility, drivers include a full year of rate actions in 2014, including ELL's $10

million rate increase in December of this year and potential rate actions in 2015, including the EMI rate case, which is
in progress. Also recall that last quarter we noted that some of our Utility tax benefits originally expected in 2014 are
now more likely to fall in 2015 and at EWC, note that the EBITDA expectation includes a full year benefit of DOE
waste fees set at zero.
At our Analyst Day, we also provided three-year long-term outlooks for the Utility business net income, EWC
operational adjusted EBITDA and consolidated earnings per share growth. As Leo indicated earlier, the precise
building blocks or how we achieve those outlooks are likely to change due to the nature of our business. Utility outlook
is to achieve $1 billion to $1.50 billion of operational net income by 2016. The unique industrial growth opportunity is
the cornerstone of the Utility's earnings outlook. We continue to develop new levers to grow the top line and make
productive investments beyond the discussions at the Analyst Day to ensure we meet those expectations.
At EWC, operational adjusted EBITDA estimates that we provide in our webcast Appendix materials are based on
market prices as of a certain point in time. 2016 prices from our Analyst Day were consistent with both our point of
view and April 30th forwards, but were about 4% higher than market prices as of June 30. This has led to lower June
30th mark-to-market EBITDA around the bottom of our stated point of view range for 2016. While point of view
development is an evergreen process, our point of view evaluates longer-term fundamentals and is not as volatile as
day-to-day market prices. Despite some near-term gas market headwinds, we still expect to see natural gas demand
pick up over the next five years and drive marginal natural gas drilling towards slightly higher priced dry gas areas.
Meanwhile, we continue to see tightening reserve margins in key Northeast power markets. With these considerations,
we reasonably believe that we can meet our consolidated 2016 growth targets even with volatility and the underlying
earnings drivers. Our Analyst Day in June is barely in the rear view mirror. We laid out then and reinforced today how
we intend to create sustainable value for our four key stakeholders; our owners, customers, employees and
communities. And while the building blocks will evolve over time, we still intend to achieve the overarching goals that
we communicated at our Analyst Day as we look to aggressively grow the Utility and actively preserve the optionality
and manage the risk at EWC.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Dan Eggers at Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Just following up on the point of view conversation, which is obviously getting a lot of
attention. If the point of view was consistent with where prices were earlier in the second quarter, can you talk about
the lack of additional hedging that happened from the first quarter to the second quarter and how you guys are going to
kind of approach the hedging strategy over the remainder of the year?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Sure. Dan, this is Bill. Couple of things. As we look at what's happened in the shorter-term market as
mentioned, we've seen moderate weather, increasing storage. Obviously, the front end of the curve has dropped down.
However, when you look at 2015, we are still – our point of view is consistent with market, and in fact, in the second
quarter we executed about 750 megawatts of hedges or converting placeholder hedges into more fixed price hedges,
which represents about 17% of the portfolio. So at this point in time, we believe we have got 2015 adequately hedged.
As you look out into the future, 2016 and beyond, our point of view is largely unchanged. Perhaps 2016 was reduced a
little bit from a point of view perspective, but remember that as we talk about the ability to hedge, there's a couple of
things to consider.

One is, and primarily is, the liquidity out in the marketplace. So as we look at hedging 2016 to 2018, we're seeing a
much less liquidity than we do for 2015. Obviously our point of view is higher than current market prices and
increasingly higher as you go further out on the curve really due to the drivers both from a heat rate perspective, heat
rates being compressed and our point of view on demand for natural gas. So we remain bullish on natural gas because
of addition of gas generation, shutdown of coal units, incremental industrial load, additional exports to Mexico and
LNG expansion.
So really the challenge we face 2016 to 2018 is just a lack of liquidity and the fact that our point of view is substantially
higher. The other piece of that is if you remember I think we were pretty clear at Analyst Day, volatility in the markets
has been substantial since the polar vortex, therefore, making structured products, options, et cetera much more costly,
and really we don't believe now is the time to put those hedges on.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Thank you for that explanation, and then, Leo, there seems to be couple of Utility properties for
sale in the region. Can you just remind us how you guys think about M&A and how that prioritizes against the CapEx
program you guys have internally?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Sure, Dan. The whole M&A question for us has not changed in terms of how we think about it.
We have our objectives as a company that we're trying to meet in terms of growing the business, and if we can do
transactions that will facilitate that objective, we'll do them. So something with a growth opportunity, something with a
balance sheet opportunity, something with a cash flow opportunity, things like that.
The capital decision that you're talking about for us is probably a little bit unique and that we have significant amount
of growth opportunities that reside within the Utility itself, the organic kind of growth. So that just, I guess, would tend
to potentially make the bar higher if we were looking to deploy capital, deploy balance sheet, towards something, it
would have to be a superior way to grow the business than the objectives or the opportunities that we have within the
business itself.
And again, as we've talked about a lot of times, the size of the customers that we look to add, the 1,700 megawatts, is
between now and kind of the foreseeable future. But as long as oil to gas ratio stays where it is, as long as the
opportunities remain out there from a manufacturing standpoint, you know, that was just a point in time estimate. We
go out beyond that; we would continue to see that growth opportunity.
So nothing's changed. If you think about our objectives, growing the Utility business and preserving optionality within
EWC, if we can help manage that with a transaction, we'll do it. But the thing we have to be mindful of is the capital
deployment opportunities we have within the business as well.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Great. Thank you, guys.

So we'll go next to Michael Weinstein with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning. It's Julien here, actually.

what's going on in New York, not just with the highway but the REV, how do you see that impacting the future of
Indian Point? And perhaps more broadly, what are your latest thoughts on the Lower Hudson Valley, pricing and
sustainability as a construct, if you could comment?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Sure. This is Bill. As it relates to our point of view on New York, if you look at where they stand,
obviously they're in a situation where they've got declining reserve margins. In fact, as Leo mentioned, if you look at
their projections as they go into the future, they really need Indian Point. In fact, if they try to pull Indian Point out of
the portfolio, even with some of the resource additions proposed, they violate reliability limits.

So we believe that projects or policies, such as REV, are certainly something that can be implemented over time. But it
will take a substantial amount of time to implement those. And if you look at lot of the proposed projects in New York
and the timing associated with those projects, you really have to question the viability of those projects and if they can
meet the actual commercial operations date. So our point of view is that Indian Point remains critical for reliability,
economic sustainability and also environmental sustainability.
As it relates to Lower Hudson Valley zone, we feel confident that FERC will uphold its decision on that zone. Prices
can change in that zone as resources are added. As we look out into the future we include some of that in our forecast.
Obviously, Danskammer is on the front burner right now and so we're watching that very closely. Our point of view on
that is that maybe part of that unit may become commercially viable within a reasonable period of time. The rest of that
unit may take longer as it relates to the larger units at that facility, but we, in general, we believe that the pricing
associated with LHV will be maintained and that FERC will uphold its prior decisions.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. And could you just clarify a little bit on the last question. When it comes to
your 2% to 4% range in the context of the latest commodities, can you clarify do you see any improvement on the
regulated side to offset the commodity? Or are you effectively saying status quo, we're moving forward on the plan on
the regulated side and we have a view on the commodity that is different than the commodity is today?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This is Drew. It's more the latter, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Okay.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: It's – the Utility we continue to look for ways that we can – look for levers that can help us
maintain the $1 billion to $1.50 billion and if the opportunity is available maybe go above that. But right now what
we're talking about is if the Utility is $1 billion to $1.50 billion and then our point of view is the part that EWC that
gets us back to the 2% to 4%.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent.

And we'll go next to Kit Konolige at BGC.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Kit.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: So I wanted to ask a little bit about your mention, Leo, of the carbon rule. I noted that you said
that the implementation may not match the EPA's objectives if I can quote or misquote you. But can you give us a little
more detail on what you think the development of that situation might look like?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Sure. Rod will handle that.
<A - Roderick K. West>: Behind the comment is the observation, we're not going to make a formal statement beyond
it, it is the observation that the state by state limits that have been, that at least are evident in the EPA proposed rule,
remember it is just a proposal, suggest to us that we're not going to, it's not going to be an easy path to achieve across
the board emissions if we just limit it to a state by state approach.
Our fear is that the marginal cost of compliance across the board is ultimately going to wind up working against EPA's
objectives to reduce carbon and have a greater impact on, for instance, jobs, the cost of electricity for customers. Here
is where we see the chaos creating problems for EPA's objectives. If we aren't able between now and October to arrive
at, let's just call it, a consensus position for EPA, given the industry, given the respective states, we're going to put,
we're going to force EPA to wind up having to go square against Congress and as a forcing mechanism to try and get at

a comprehensive energy plan. We don't see that as being realistic within EPA's timeline.
And what we're trying to figure out between now and October is whether or not there's a path that allows us to get
there. And so we're taking a very cautious approach but recognizing the complexity of this rule alone, it's just making it
really difficult for us to see a path where EPA is actually achieving these stated goals, of achieving through its four,
what we call building blocks, to achieving any realistic, achievable, enforceable rules at the end of the day.
And Entergy has been at the forefront of greenhouse gas reductions from 2012. And just from our limited perspective
given where we are today, we really don't see how beyond EPA's stated goals how they'd get there from here. And it's
just we're trying to remain optimistic. We're trying to remain engaged with EPA in figuring out whether the rule can be
modified between now and October. But we're having a hard time finding a reason to be optimistic that this ultimately
works for us.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Kit, if I could just add, as Rod said, there's stated objectives about the reductions, stated
objectives about the flexibility, stated objectives about types of technology and everything and then there's a lot of math
behind the rule. And we're not sure that the math and the stated objectives all mesh up as well, but as he said, proposed
rule through constructive dialogue, through those sorts of things maybe we get there. But it's just kind of drawing that
line as Rod said between all those objectives, the complexity of the state by state issue and then the math that goes
behind it that might not support it, but it's still early in the process.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Right. Okay, and then the follow on one particular state, New York, has there been any indication
that the folks who matter in New York say at the Governor's office or other high ranking officials that the possibility of
the carbon implementation has changed their thinking at all or led them to reassess how they think about Indian Point?
<A - Bill Mohl>: This is Bill. I would say at this point we have not seen any – we haven't had any significant dialogue
associated with that. We've had some conversations with the PSC but I think like us everybody is still in the process of
trying to evaluate this and understand how it practically gets implemented. So it wouldn't be fair to say we've seen a
change in their position at this point in time.

And we'll move next to Steven Fleishman at Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Hey, Leo, I know you guys have been a point of view company from as far as I can ever
remember, but I don't recall kind of initially having the point of view as part of the guidance. So just when we're
thinking about future quarters and periods, how are you going to be updating the point of view so to speak? Just so we
– I'm sure you're updating somewhat at all the time but is this more of like an annual thing, quarterly thing? How
should we think about that?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, I'd say that in continuing with past practice, we are not putting our point of view in
guidance. In continuing with other, with past practices, we are – we've got it overarching in our decision making
process and in our outlook. So when we look at guidance, with the exception of the fact that I think last year when we
were given – we had to put something in on Lower Hudson Valley and there was no market and so we're clear about
imputing that. Our guidance is inclusive of market, not our point of view.
Now our outlook of what we think is achievable and where we'll be, that's based on what we think is going to happen.
And in a lot of situations, that includes an assumption about the price power. And that's where we put our point of view
and where we think we'll be at that point in time. But we would distinguish that different from guidance. And that's I
don't think different than our past practices.

As far as how often we'll update that, obviously we're going to continue to give you a perspective around where we
think we're going to get by 2016, et cetera. But that will probably be on a quarterly basis. And while we update our
book every day, we don't run all the way through all the financial models every day all the time. Hope that helps.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yes. And just one other question on the 2015 earnings consideration slide, I think all of
these were basically things that were in the outlook you gave at the Analyst Day. Is that correct? There's – none of
these are really new?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: No. I don't think any of these are new, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And you highlight the pension discount rate a couple of times; was that just because
that's been a volatility item historically?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yes. As you know, it gets that at the end of each year based on interest rates at that
particular point in time. And so it is uncertain as to whether it will actually become until you get to that point. Interest
rates have been trending down most of the year. So there is some risk to that. And I know you all are aware of that. But
that's just part of the list. We want to make sure that you're thinking about all the drivers that we're thinking about.

We'll move next to Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Jon.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Just a quick one on, there's been obviously a filing made at the New York PSC around
some kind of a contract support for another upstate nuclear plant. Could you comment on that, just conceptually, and
any sort of likelihood or interest in a similar arrangement or request for Fitzpatrick?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Hey, Jonathan, this is Bill. Yes, we're well aware of the filing that's been made regarding that facility.
Our understanding at this point in time is that is for – to meet a short-term reliability need. As it relates to Fitzpatrick,
we always consider those types of options. But in general, we continue to try to advocate for improved market
structures. Our general thought is that if – we have the right market structure which values the attributes of specific
generators. And obviously, with nuclear it's base load, carbon-free generation with onsite fuel. That is a much better
long-term solution. However, if there are opportunities to enter into other agreements based on certain other needs on
the system such as reliability, we certainly are open to that. But nothing on the table right now.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Is there – could there be a similar reliability issue to the – I guess, it's the Rochester one,
up around Fitzpatrick's location or less likely in that case?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Probably, unlikely.

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I guess just back to the point of view. Could you give us what you think the reason is that the
market is mispricing or is not accurately forecasting the issues that you see coming up in terms of reserve margin, et
cetera?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Sure. A couple things you have to remember that I think are constants in what we've talked about for
a number of years as it relates to point of view and the forward market is, number one, is as you look at the forward
power markets, you got to remember that there's a lot more sellers than there are buyers as it relates to long-dated
transactions. And so while we see very good liquidity in the front end of the curve, so obviously for the prompt months
and for the next year, as you get beyond that, you have a lot less natural buyers.
As a result of that, probably one of the key drivers in the lower market prices is lower heat rates. And that's just the
situation that we are dealing with and we have been dealing with. As you get closer to delivery, then you will see the
markets respond. You'll see heat rates increase and you'll see the issue such as the physical constraints that exist in the
market, in the physical delivery market, start to come out in the forward markets. And so I can't tie it to any specific
issue. Our belief is that in general, infrastructure in the Northeast is going to be constrained. We're seeing a lot more
retirements than we are seeing resource additions. Therefore, we're seeing lower reserve margins, and as we saw during
the polar vortex, when you get periods of high peak demand, then you see a significant rise in the price of both natural
gas and the price of power.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And so basically around this time next year, or by this time next year, you would expect
the forward curve to come in line. Is that how we should think about it?
<A - Bill Mohl>: We'll see...
<Q - Paul Patterson>: ...or the 2016, yes.
<A - Bill Mohl>: Yes. We'll see the prompt year start to rise and as you get closer to delivery then depending on what
the actual physical conditions are, then you see much more volatility as we did this last winter.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then turning to New York and the legislation which passed the House of
Representatives to de-fund I guess FERC's activity regarding the new capacity zone, how should we think about, A,
what do you think the likelihood of that passing the Senate would be? And B, even if it does pass the Senate, what
would the practical effect be considering that I think pretty much FERC has already acted on this and acted on the
hearing if I understand it correctly. If you could just sort of elaborate a little bit on that.
<A - Bill Mohl>: Well, first let me say that this type of intervention in the markets goes to the very heart of what we're
working on from a market structure perspective and is what's actually undermining some of the markets, overall when
we actually see political motives behind proposed changes that affect that market. As it relates to this specific
appropriations bill, we – it's not currently, has not been initiated in the Senate at all. And our prevailing belief is that
FERC has ruled on this, they've had all the information required to make their decision and we remain confident they
will maintain that decision going forward.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. But I mean, if they de-fund this, how would that actually impact FERC? I mean, is there
– would it just be simply symbolic? Or would it actually have a practical impact on the capacity zone? Can you...
<A - Roderick K. West>: In terms of, this is Rod West, in terms of the actual order that FERC currently has out, the
rule is in place. And so the de-funding doesn't change the tariff that's ultimately in effect. Yes, you can assume – and
you'd have to ask FERC this, whether or not they were specifically de-funded, whether they would lose the ability to
access resources from other sources to actually do their job. It's so from a practical matter, the rule is where it is and in
the unlikely event, and we do not believe that it is a likely outcome that the Senate would carry that amendment, that's a
question for FERC, but we have to have confidence that FERC's jurisdiction at the end of the day is going to be upheld
and supported through the legislative process.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

We'll go next to Paul Fremont at Jefferies.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Thanks. Looking at the preliminary 2015 drivers, can you elaborate at all on the changes in
the, the effective changes in EWC deprecation? Because I guess in 2014, I think your guidance had like a $0.25
increase in depreciation, and it looks like you're looking for depreciation to go up yet further in 2015.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yes, this is Drew. That just relates to normal incremental capital, most of it above what
we're depreciating right now related to Fukushima and the like. So that's just normal changes. Last year, Paul, you'll
remember that we had that new depreciation study, and that's what was driving...
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Right.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: ...the larger change, from last year to this year. Going forward, we wouldn't expect to see
such a large change. It would just be normal capital increases.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: And in terms of the useful life of nuclear, that assumption, is there any type of a major
change there?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: No. No changes there.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Okay. And then in terms of the Department of Environmental Conservation remaining
hearings in New York, can you give us an idea of when the hearings are expected to end on Indian Point?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Sure. I think you saw a flurry of activity last week regarding this matter, where we had a number of
politicians, business folks, community members really speak out against the proposed capacity outages. Following that,
the ALJs decided that they were going to push back the hearings associated with that topic for several months. They
were scheduled to take place in January of 2015. Our point of view on this whole process hasn't really changed since
we talked to you at Analyst Day, as we don't see any decision occurring on this matter any time before 2016, and likely
may get pushed beyond that. So our point of view on that is consistent with what we talked to you about at Analyst
Day.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: So 2016 would be an actual DEC final decision?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Could be a decision at that point in time. However, remember that as we detailed, there's a number of
appeals, processes, et cetera that we could pursue. So that wouldn't be the final word, so to speak...
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Right. And that takes you to the 2018 timeframe, right?

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Wanted to talk about membership in MISO and just if there's any general timing we should
be thinking about in terms of further transmission planning, sort of signposts we can look to in terms of the capital that
will be required to integrate Entergy into MISO.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Theo, you want to take that?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yes. I'll start and maybe others could weigh on this a little bit. MISO obviously goes
through with its transmission planning processes. And as I think as I talked about at the Analyst Day, we talked a little
bit about transmission opportunities, and I laid out a timeline as it related to projects that might have been submitted
under MISO's MVP/MEP processes. And August, the month of August, August we think actually is a time when we
would see MISO completing some evaluations of projects that they would consider for their MTEP 2014 process.
So we also generally have our typical MISO transmission planning process that you would go through as a part of
MISO where we would submit projects, reliability projects, and that sort of thing. As we laid out again at Analyst Day,
I think we said we had about $1.7 billion of transmission CapEx through 2016. Many of the projects that would be
reliability type projects that we would submit through MISO would be part of that $1.7 billion. But again, as you think
about other types of projects, the MVP projects or other types of projects that might enhance economic benefits, you
could see potentially spending above that level.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. Thank you. And just shifting gears for follow-up on Indian Point in the Coastal Zone
Management Process, what is the earliest date under which the New York State Department of State could make a
consistency determination? I know the deadline is at the end of this year. But what would be the earliest date they could
make a decision?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Well, they could actually make a decision themselves by the end of the year. However, we have
reason to believe as based on previous experience, that, that decision could actually be further delayed. Remember,
consistent with our discussion at Analyst Day, then that would, if it was an adverse decision, then we would take that to
a Secretary of Commerce appeal process, which lasts over a year and then there's appeals process in addition to that. So
at this point in time everything that we mentioned at Analyst Day is still correct.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. Thank you very much.
