Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's
operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual
results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and
uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife, Inc.'s filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. MetLife, Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking

Conor Murphy, Investor Relations
Good morning, everyone, welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2010 earnings call. We're delighted to be here this
morning to talk about our results for the quarter.
We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called
GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in
our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement both of which are available at MetLife.com on our
Investor Relations page.

A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not
accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains
and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian,
our Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments we
will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management
including: Bill Mullaney, President of U.S. Business; Bill Toppeta, President of International; Bill Moore, President of
Auto and Home; and Donna DeMaio, President of MetLife Bank.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob.
C. Robert Henrikson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Conor, and good morning, everyone. Today I'd like to begin with some comments on the acquisition of
Alico.
As you know, we expect to complete the deal very soon and let me remind you what this will do for MetLife. It will be
rewarding to our shareholders and will significantly accelerate our strategy by improving our long-term growth in
revenues, in earnings and in ROE. It will increase our global presence in both emerging and mature markets, many in
which MetLife will have a top five market share and will give us the opportunity to become the leading life insurance
and employee benefits provider in the world.
Now, let me share our overall MetLife results for the quarter. MetLife performed well, with continued growth in both
our top and bottom line. We generated premiums, fees and other revenues of 8.6 billion, up 2% over the third quarter of
2009. We increased operating earnings to 878 million, up 22% over the prior year period. I'm also pleased to report that
our book value improved considerably, up 24% over the year ago period and 8% sequentially, driven by our strong
operating earnings and our investment performance.
Driving this quarter's growth is our continued focus on the fundamentals: disciplined growth, excellent underwriting,
solid expense control and strong investment returns. You'll hear more from Steve Kandarian in a moment but I would
like to say that we continue to be pleased with the investment portfolio's performance. Investment losses including
impairments continue to trend lower. This was partly due to our best in class real estate portfolio where loan to values
improved, again, this quarter. Our reserve against future losses came down further and now our delinquencies have
fallen back to just two basis points.
Turning to our domestic business segment results, U.S. business generated premiums, fees and other revenues of 7.1
billion, flat over the prior year period, though up modestly excluding the impact of lower pension closeout activity
which, as you know, can vary from quarter to quarter. Operating earnings grew by 21% with significant increases in
each of the major segments, largely driven by very strong underwriting results as well as the benefit of ongoing
expense management.
In our insurance products segment, premiums, fees and other revenues were consistent with the third quarter of 2009 at
5 billion. And operating earnings grew 14% up in each product line.
Group life premiums grew 2% and operating earnings were up 6% compared with the prior year period. The Group
Life mortality ratio was very good at 89% and has remained below investor day guidance each quarter this year.
Non-medical health revenues were up slightly reflecting higher dental revenue, still partly offset by lower disability
revenue. Operating earnings grew by 49% driven by improved interest and underwriting margins. The non-medical
health benefits ratio remained good at 88% consistent with the second quarter.
Individual life premiums, fees and other revenues were down due to unusual items in the year ago period and flat when
normalized. Operating earnings grew by 5%, reflecting solid mortality results.

In retirement products the top line grew to 738 million, up 11% on sales, high persistency and higher fee income.
Variable annuity sales reached a record of 4.7 billion, up 35% over the third quarter of 2009 driven by momentum in
third party distribution channels. We also are benefiting from additional distribution relationships launched over the
past year. Operating earnings increased 42% due to growth in net flows and higher net investment income.
In corporate benefit funding, premiums, fees and other revenues of 618 million were down year-over-year driven by
less pension closeout activity, however, structured settlement premiums grew by 2% over the prior year period and 4%
sequentially. Operating earnings increased 35% over the prior year due primarily to higher investment income.
Auto and home had another strong quarter. Net written premiums increased 3% to 780 million. Operating earnings
were strong at 81 million. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was excellent at 88.2%.
MetLife Bank had a record quarter. Total operating revenues for the bank increased 8% to 410 million driven by higher
mortgage servicing revenue and more refinancing activity. Operating earnings grew 26% to 101 million.
Now turning to our current international business, we achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three
regions. On a recorded basis, premiums, fees and other revenues of 1.3 billion grew 16% over the prior year period.
Operating earnings increased by 25% to 191 million due to growth in the business and a one-time tax-related benefit.
In our Latin America region growth in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil contributed to its top line growth of 21%. The Asia
Pacific region grew 11% due primarily to higher sales in Korea and Hong Kong. And in our Europe, Middle East and
India region, the top line increased by 7% reflecting continued growth in Europe and India.
Earlier this morning, we announced the sale of our Japanese venture to our joint venture partner. The agreement we
have reached is in the best interest of shareholders, policyholders and employees. Though we have enjoyed an excellent
partnership and much success with the joint venture we can now leverage our expertise and position in the Japanese
market to focus on Alico in Japan.
As we move forward we will transition to a global enterprise, through refreshed strategies, enhanced operating models,
expanded global branding, an engaged and a committed management. I look forward to our investor day on December
6 when you'll hear more about how we will deliver increased value to our customers and shareholders as the leading
global insurance company. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer
Thanks, Rob.
I'd like to review some key components of our investment results for the quarter. First, let me begin with the variable
investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income for the third quarter was $292 million which is $92 million
above the top of the planned range that I provided on investor day. This was primarily driven by strong private equity
returns across our global portfolio. We are currently seeing similar private equity funds take advantage of improving
market conditions to accelerate realizations which is leading us to believe that barring any unforeseen market events
variable income should remain strong throughout the rest of the year.
Now let me cover investment portfolio gains and losses. Gross investment losses for the third quarter were $215
million. Gross investment gains were $212 million and write-downs were $98 million for a net investment loss of $101
million. These levels are in line with the past several quarters and we believe are modest given the current economic
environment.
Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $4.8 billion, down from $10.8 billion at year end.
For the quarter, gross unrealized gains increased $5.5 billion to $19.7 billion as interest rates and credit spreads
declined. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined 46 basis points and spreads for investment grade
corporate credit declined approximately 20 basis points. Overall the fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio was
in a net unrealized gain position of $14.8 billion at quarter end, a dramatic improvement from a $24.4 billion net
unrealized loss just six quarters ago.

As to our commercial mortgage portfolio, as Rob mentioned, the loan to value of our portfolio improved again this
quarter to 67% down from 68% last quarter as valuations continued to improve in markets in which we invest. Our
commercial mortgage valuation allowance declined by $48 million to $573 million. Approximately $20 million of the
decline was a reduction in our FAS 5 general reserve due to improved market conditions. The remaining decline is
largely due to the resolution of certain delinquent loans in our U.S. portfolio.
Total delinquent commercial mortgage loans decreased to $8 million from $137 million last quarter with no
delinquencies in our U.S. portfolio at the end of the third quarter. The decrease in delinquencies was driven by one loan
being paid off at 98% and a transfer of a high-quality property to our real estate equity portfolio. I should caution that
our delinquency numbers will fluctuate over time as challenges remain in the commercial real estate market.
Nevertheless, we believe that we will continue to maintain relatively low loss levels and outperform the overall market.
Finally, let me comment on our cash position which increased from $20.4 billion last quarter to $26.1 billion this
quarter. The vast majority of this increase can be attributed to the cash that we are holding for our Alico purchase. In
addition, cash collateral balances relating to our derivative counterparties increased. Excluding the impact of these two
factors, our cash position remains consistent with second quarter levels, and is down approximately $4 billion since
investor day as we reinvested into higher yielding assets.
In summary, we believe that our portfolio remains well positioned for the current economic environment. With that I
will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.
William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Steve and good morning, everybody.
MetLife reported $0.99 of operating earnings per share for the third quarter. This quarter's results include a dilutive
impact of $0.08 per share resulting from the Alico equity and debt issuance completed in early August. This morning
I'll walk through our financial results and point out some highlights as well as some unusual items which occurred
during the quarter.
Let's begin with the top line. Total premiums, fees and other revenues, which were 8.6 billion in the third quarter, were
up 2% from the third quarter of last year and up 4% when adjusting for closeout sales in both periods. As we have
noted before, closeout sales can fluctuate from quarter to quarter and have been adversely impacted by this low-interest
rate environment.
U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of 7.1 billion were essentially flat as compared to the prior year
quarter. This includes a modest decrease in insurance products revenue due to Individual Life's 4% decline. Adjusting
for a few unusual items recorded in each of the periods, Individual Life's top line was actually down less than 1%.
Group Life premiums were up 2% from the prior year quarter. As you may recall from my second quarter remarks,
growth in Group Life is being helped by a change in financial terms and a large retrospectively rated contract, which
resulted in less reinsurance ceded. As this change occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009, the benefit to Group Life's top
line growth over the prior four quarters will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year.
Overall, group insurance revenue continues to be impacted by high unemployment and our unwillingness to chase
business at below desired margins or returns. Also, revenue in retirement products increased by 11% due to higher
separate account fees from positive net flows and favorable separate account investment returns. Also group revenue in
corporate benefit funding was down 13% from the prior year quarter driven by the lower closeout premiums which I
referenced before.
Structured settlement premiums remain strong. Auto and Home's revenues were up by 2% and MetLife Bank's
revenues grew by 11%. International's revenue was up 16% on a reported basis and 11% on a constant currency basis
over the prior year quarter driven by growth across all three regions and led by Mexico, Korea and Chile.

Operating margins. Turning to our operating margins let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our
mortality results were favorable this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89% versus our
estimated range of 90-95% which is a good result. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 86.7%. This
quarter's results were higher than the very favorable prior quarter of 80.4%. That said, the ratio was significantly below
the prior-year quarter of 91.2% and also below our plan, overall another good result.
88% – at 88% for the third quarter the non-medical total health benefits ratio was up slightly over the sequential quarter
of 87.8% but favorable to the prior year quarter of 90.7% and well within our investor day guidance range of 86 to
90%.
Dental underwriting results continue to see stable utilization and favorable pricing trends. Disability margins continue
to be plan as incidence levels remain elevated and recoveries continue to be below expectations.
Turning to our Auto and Home business, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.6% for the quarter which
was up over the prior year's quarter -- prior year quarter's results of 91.1% due to higher catastrophes in the current
quarter. The combined ratio excluding Cats was 88.2% in the third quarter versus 87.7 in the prior year period. A
non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of 3 million after-tax was taken in this quarter and that's compared
to a 7 million after-tax release in the prior year period.
Moving to investment spreads, we saw continued solid investment spreads this quarter driven in part by strong variable
investment income results. For the quarter, variable investment income after-tax and the impact of deferred acquisition
costs was $56 million or $0.06 per share above the top of the 2010 guidance range. As Steve explained, this was
primarily driven by strong private equity returns.
Moving to expenses, our operational expense – Operational Excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Our
expense ratio for the quarter was 22.5% which is a solid result and within the 2010 guidance of 21.8 to 22.5% given at
investor day.
Turning to our bottom line results we earned 878 million in operating earnings or $0.99 per share. Included in our third
quarter results was an unfavorable market impact of 36 million or $0.04 per share as the increase of 11% in the S&P
500 this quarter was more than offset by the impact from our variable annuity hedge program. In the second quarter of
this year we had essentially the opposite situation, where a 12% decline in the S&P 500 was more than offset by the
results of our hedge programs creating a $0.05 favorable market impact in that quarter.
In addition, our total operating taxes of 378 million includes a true-up in our effective tax rate for the year from 27% to
28% as well as a net tax benefit of several one-time items in the quarter. Overall, the results of various international and
domestic tax issues impacted operating earnings by $19 million or $0.02 in the quarter.
With regard to investment gains and losses in the third quarter, we had after-tax net realized investment losses of 222
million which includes net investment portfolio losses of 72 million after tax, impairments were 64 million after tax in
the third quarter and continued to trend down. In addition, as Rob mentioned, we have sold our Japanese joint venture –
announced the sale to our joint venture partner and recorded an impairment which shows up in realized investment
losses.
With regard to derivatives we had after-tax losses of $190 million. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its
broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks including changes in interest rates and fluctuations
in foreign currencies. The decline in the relative value of the dollar as well as the tightening of MetLife's own credit
spread partially offset by declines in interest rates resulted in the derivative loss for this quarter. Derivative gains or
losses related to MetLife's own credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company.
Our preliminary statutory earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were approximately 850 million and our preliminary
statutory net income was approximately 800 million which is a good result.
Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at quarter end were 9.8 billion. Please keep in mind this total includes
the Alico financing which we completed in early August. The total was 6.5 billion.

In summary, MetLife had a good third quarter. Our investment performance continued to improve, our operating
margins remained strong by disciplined underwriting expense management and our earnings continued to grow.
With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question, we go to the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
<Q - Nigel Dally>: Great, thanks. My question is on interest rates, appreciate the commentary you provided
surrounding the impact for 2011. Several questions on that, though. First, was that just the expected spread
compressions or does that also incorporate other factors such as top line pressure and pension expenses? Also, how
much of an offset is foreign exchange going to be to the interest rate impact as we look to 2011? Thanks.
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I forgot to turn on my mike.
They – so just for everybody's benefit we filed an 8-K a month or so ago which said that in 2011 sort of given the
current interest rate environment we expected that to impact operating earnings by $0.20 a share. Now, the way we
came up with that calculation, most of that $0.20 is from investment spread compression. And – but we also did factor
in, you know, at least a preliminary estimate of how our pension costs might change and obviously that will get
trued-up at year-end given where the stock market is and, frankly where the interest rates are on that – on December 31,
because that's how the math works on the pension costs, so that was factored in, Nigel.
We didn't think about – we did not consider impacts to what I would say, you know, top-line issues which are
obviously a little hard to quantify and, you know, the most obvious impact of that is where our pension closeout sales
which are soft now and which, you know, I suspect we don't think are going to get meaningfully better next year until
interest rates start to improve so that's most of the issue.
I forget, did I – is that all your question? Oh, FX, right. So, you know, FX is actually having – you know, you saw a
very strong decline in the value of the dollar versus the yen and the euro this quarter and the FX impact for
international is actually quite modest. I mean, it's a gain but it's less than a penny.
Now, with Alico, that will change. And the FX impact will be more pronounced and so, you know, if you think about
it, what that really means is Alico's earnings expressed in dollars are probably going to be stronger, all things
considered than we originally estimated because when we announced the deal, we did expect, you know, we assumed
one set of exchange rates and, you know, and then the dollar has weakened since then. So Alico's earnings impact is
going to be better.
Now, we don't really take the spot rate right now, we look at the, you know, I guess the forward – what we considered
to be the forward exchange rate which – where the dollar, I think, is expected to rally a little bit so the impact may not
be as significant as you might at first think. But that will obviously get – you know, we'll obviously kind of wrap that
all up on our Investor Day -- our guidance for 2011 on Investor Day.
<Q - Nigel Dally>: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question, we go to the line of Colin Devine from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Colin Devine>: Good morning. I have a couple questions. Bill, Ameriprise on their call yesterday brought up the
issue that they're seeing much higher persistency on their annuities than they had modeled and they had adjusted their
DAC amortization period rather dramatically in response to that. I was wondering if you've done anything at MET on
that, if you're seeing those trends, if that's the sort of thing we should be expecting from you? I believe Ameriprise

tucked their fixed annuity DAC amortization at 30 years and doubled their VAs to 40. That's the first question.
Then the second one and really perhaps for you or really for Rob, while I'm happy see you get out of the VA joint
venture in Japan, frankly, does this signal somewhat of a change in strategic direction for MET with respect to your
global appetite for variable annuity business?
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: The second one is a real heavy
one.
[Laughter].
<Q - Colin Devine>: That's why I directed it to Rob, you're off the hook.
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You know, I'm not going to
comment on Ameriprise, I refuse. But I will say this, we'll do it – we'll do it, you know, our normal DAC unlocking
study that we do in the fourth quarter, we'll obviously do that again in this quarter and I would say the following. We
do see persistency improving in our variable annuity business and that shouldn't surprise anybody, frankly, given where
interest rates are and where the stock market is. I would – I don't believe that's going to cause us to change our DAC
amortization policy or the period of time.
Just for everybody's benefit, we would amortize a variable annuity DAC over 20 years, and we would – on our fixed
annuity DAC we would amortize, I think also over 20 years, but the way that works is, you know, there's a rate
guarantee in your deferred annuity contract and what we assume is a pretty big, when the rate guarantee comes off, the
DAC model would assume a pretty big shock lapse, something like, crudely, 50% so most of the DAC amortization
would be very front-end-loaded, but if people stay, then the rest of it would run out to 20 years, so that's sort of our
policy and I really don't expect that to change.
<Q - Colin Devine>: Thank you, now for Rob.
<A - C. Robert Henrikson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, good morning, Colin. I
agree with you, and I'm glad you stated it the way you did, we're really quite pleased at the way we've been able to exit
our JV in Japan, both for us and quite frankly, for our JV partner. This, of course, from our point of view gives us, as I
mentioned in my comments, the ability, without any distraction, to focus 100% on our Alico business in Japan and
that's a good thing.
Relative to variable annuity appetite, I think everyone expects from me somewhat of the same comment about variable
annuities, and it's the same worldwide as it would be in the United States, and that is, we think that there's a terrific
need in the savings arena for the type of products and services we can provide, both from the standpoint of the
accumulation of assets and the creation of income for life. We think that's very important.
At the same time, we've always said we do not want to become overly dependent on any one product for our financial
health and I would include variable annuities in that statement, so that the growth opportunity for us worldwide, it
varies by country to country. I don't think you would see our growth being driven, for example, 100% by variable
annuity sales anywhere. And – but we do see significant opportunities.
Relative to Alico, as I've mentioned, our first focus is on bringing home exactly the business that we analyzed and we
loved so much: the accident and health, life insurance and so forth. In addition to that, of course, we bring
competencies to the Alico family that they were in some cases precluded from using because of their sister companies
at AIG and so forth. And so we're very excited about it. We love the variable annuity business. We're not in love with
it. But it is a very, very attractive product for our customers worldwide.
<Q - Colin Devine>: Rob, given the relatively negligible amount of money involved on this JV for a company of your
size, then – I'm glad you brought up your last comment because I was going to play it back to you, should we really be
interpreting this as that you're a little less in love with the VA business than you were before?

<A - C. Robert Henrikson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't want to go into a long
explanation on how in love I've been with the variable annuities business...
<Q - Colin Devine>: I think the actions state it.
[Laughter].
<A - C. Robert Henrikson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: ...and whether or not that answer
would meet your expectations. But look at it this way, we have been very, very focused on return on capital and the
returns we can get relative to our breadth of products and services that can both increase our ROE, increase our margins
and have the best use of capital for the company and so that's basically the answer. I am definitely in love with anything
that can deliver that kind of result to our shareholders.
<Q - Colin Devine>: Okay, thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Nadel>: There's a lot of love this morning. Any – I guess I've got a couple questions. Any update you can
provide as to the outlook for the earnings accretion from Alico given the changing interest rate and FX environment
since the deal was announced? I was just wondering if the move, especially the move in rates, has had any impact on
your estimates for VOBA or goodwill. We saw some impacts across the river and I was just wondering if we should
think about any altering of the earnings stream upon the closing there?
Also related to Alico, wondering if you have any update for us on the progress you're making with regulators overseas
as it relates to getting dividends out.
And then finally I had a question on your group disability business. Can you give us a sense for where the new claims
discount rate sits and what kind of sensitivity we should think about and is that in your $0.20 estimate for interest rate
pressure too?
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay, I think we got all that. So
I'll start with Alico earnings accretion. Again for everybody's benefit when we did our financing in August we
refreshed the guidance we gave, we said we expected it to be 40 to 45 cents accretive in 2011. You know, since –
interest rates were pretty low then, I think they're actually a little lower now. So and I think probably the dollar's a little
weaker. I'm not sure those quite offset each other but they probably, obviously they do net.
In terms of the purchase accounting, well, again, we did revise purchase accounting, you know, when we did the
financings in August, we will put out – now that we're hopefully going to close the deal very soon, we will put out
some revised purchase accounting in an SEC filing I guess later in November so you'll get to see the math as it
currently stands. It's interesting, it's complex but the punch line is that you will see some changes in the VOBA and
goodwill balances. A little bit more – a little bit more of the purchase price will end up getting pushed to goodwill
versus VOBA. That has the effect of probably improving earnings accretion and I think so – so directionally in terms of
reported – you know, earnings accretion it's probably, you know, there's upward pressure and so that's all good, I think.
<Q - John Nadel>: Certainly. And then any progress on the capital?
<A - William Toppeta>: John, it's Bill. Do you want the answer on the regulatory one first?
<Q - John Nadel>: Thank you.
<A - William Toppeta>: Okay. We're just about there. I mean, we had to get, as you know, a large number of
regulatory approvals. We've got just about all of them at this point. And we fully anticipate that we will have all of

them and we will close on November 1.
<Q - John Nadel>: Oh, Okay. I was – I was more asking – I'm glad to hear that. But I was more interested in – I know
there had been some discussion early on, maybe it was right around the announcement, of capital levels at Alico being,
you know, sort of substantially higher than is sort of required under a reasonable solvency level or solvency capital
level. I was just wondering if there was any progress on timing for being able to get some of that capital back out into
the holding company.
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, our, look, our expectation
is that we will pay dividends out of Alico in 2011, probably later in the year. Now, I think – and I – I would say the
capital level, I mean, we express out RBC ratios, we talk about an RBC ratio for Alico and we talk about it being 400
or comfortably above 400 and when we, you know, actually do the final audits of the opening balance sheet when we
buy the business we'll know exactly what it is, but it's, you know, I think the punch line is, is that capital levels at Alico
are quite attractive. And so we'll be able to pay out a very healthy dividend out of Alico in late 2011.
The question mark is really will we be able to get anything out of Japan in 2011 just 'cause sort of some wrinkles about
how the regulatory issues will work there. And I don't think there's anything new to say, other than we think Alico
Japan is very well capitalized. But it could very well be a couple of years before we'll be able to pay dividends out, and
obviously that will be a subject of ongoing discussions with the regulator there. The money's there, it's a matter of
whether we'll dividend it out in 2011, we just don't know yet.
<Q - John Nadel>: So I'm sorry, just to follow up, Bill, I think you said expect to pay dividends out of Alico in 2011
later in the year, is that from just other geographies or is that out of -- does that get to the holding company or does that
get to an intermediary holding company? I'm not clear.
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Wow, great question. Actually,
yeah, it's coming from other geographies. And the capital levels in those other geographies are, frankly, quite good.
<Q - John Nadel>: Okay.
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And so – and unlike, then
whether it comes to the U.S. holding company or sits in some sort of international holding company is all about the tax
regime in a given country and it's all over the map. As you know, I think Japan, dividends can come back to the U.S.
holding company, because the Japan corporate tax rate is basically the same as the U.S. corporate tax rate I think
people know that, but in other geographies the policy differs.
<Q - John Nadel>: Understood, that's great, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question we go to the line of Mark Finkelstein from Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Finkelstein>: Good morning. I have two margin questions. I guess firstly, how should we think about this
level of variable annuity sales? I mean, obviously, very strong in the quarter, but just given where rates are, are margins
meeting targets on new sales? I mean, I assume hedging costs are higher and do you need to reprice? That's number
one.
And then secondly, can you just discuss what is the strategy to improve margins in disability? It sounds like we had
adverse experience both in incidence levels and recovery rates. Thanks.
<A - William Mullaney>: Hi, Mark, it's Bill Mullaney. I'll handle both of those questions. First of all, on VAs, you
know, the market for VAs continues to be good and I think you saw from our sales results, really for the whole year
that sales have been pretty strong and we've been getting sales primarily from the GMIB product but also increasingly
from an LWG product as well.

Given where the current interest rate levels are, the margin on the products that we're selling today are below what I
would say are our target margins, but I think you've got to think about this business over a cycle and so earlier in the
year when interest rates were higher, margins were good and we were writing at returns that were higher than what our
target returns are, so we think over time as interest rates come back we'll start to see returns improve closer to the
target, but we're also going to be taking some steps in 2011 to continue to improve the overall margin in the product
and the overall level of return, and so we'll be telling you more about that in the coming months.
As it relates to disability, obviously our disability results continue to be challenged in this quarter. We saw higher
incidence levels than we've seen in prior quarters. Our recoveries ticked up a little bit, but it was very, very modest
improvement in recoveries, so as a result, the overall loss ratio in disability was pretty high, it was probably one of the
highest that we've had over this past cycle. So there's a number of things that we continue to do from an operational
perspective to try and improve our disability business. We're also taking some pricing actions, again, with both our new
business and our renewal business for 2011, so we're in the market right now with I would say high single-digit
disability price increases as a way for us to bring in more revenue for the product and begin to get the loss ratios and
the margins back to target.
<Q - Mark Finkelstein>: Just to follow up on that will the market accommodate that level of rate increase based on
what you're seeing currently?
<A - William Mullaney>: Well, we have seen a little bit of an improvement from a marketplace perspective. I would
say over the last couple of years disability pricing has been fairly aggressive and so when we've gone into the market
with price increases we've lost some business and we haven't been as competitive on new business, it's one of the
reasons why the top line of the non-medical health area really hasn't grown very much and I expect that we're going to
see that trend continue to a certain degree. I think, based upon the early results, and it's still a little early in the sales
cycle, pricing seems to be moderating a little bit more in this renewal season than it was in a couple of earlier years. So
we think we have a better chance of getting our pricing but what I'll tell you is if we can't we're not afraid to walk away
from business if we don't feel we can get the right level of margin and begin to get our returns back to the right level.
<Q - Mark Finkelstein>: Thank you.
<A - C. Robert Henrikson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Mark, this is Rob, I would just add,
I couldn't – Bill's answers were right on across the board. One thing I would just remind everyone because we've said it
before, even though on variable annuities we may not be at our target rate. We're still exceeding the cost of capital on
that business so it's not like we're writing variable annuity products without adding value to the enterprise. That maybe
goes without saying, but I think I ought to say it anyway.
<Q - Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, that's helpful, thank you.

Thank you, our next question we go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan, please go ahead. Mr. Bhullar, your
line is open. Mr. Bhullar, did you have a question?
All right, we will move on, then, to the line of Andrew Kligerman from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Kligerman>: Hey, good morning, a few quick questions. First just on the Japan JV and the divestiture, I
see over the news wire I think you received $275 million. What was the impairment that you took, I think Bill
mentioned it a little earlier?
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it's – the answer's
complicated. So I'll take you through it. So we're selling our interest at a, you know, below where we have it recorded
on our books but we're actually not going to close the deal until, you know, in the first part of next year. So, you know
– so the accounting for this sale is actually sort of in two steps. And so if you collapse them, maybe the most useful
way to think about it is let's collapse the two steps and I'll give you sort of the net impact. We're going to – we'll

ultimately have to report an after-tax loss on the sale of this of about $60 million and – on a sale price of 275. Now, you
know, you think, well, that's not good. But the 60 million really has more to do with the fact of how we allocated
goodwill in the Travelers acquisition five years ago than it has with really the economics of this transaction. We
actually expect this transaction to be modestly accretive and from an EPS point of view and it's – and we're very
pleased with the valuation we received. So there is a little bit of impairment but that has more – frankly, has to do with
purchase accounting five years ago than sort of the reality of the situation today.
<Q - Andrew Kligerman>: That makes a lot of sense and then just following on Colin's questions just what are Alico
Japan's prospects for VA sales? Do they have good prospects, maybe a little color?
<A - William Toppeta>: Yeah, Andrew, it's Bill Toppeta, I would say the opportunity, the prospects are certainly good
and the reason for that is twofold. One is certainly the technical capabilities that we bring from the MetLife side on
variable annuities which I think are clear to everybody. On the other side Alico has very strong relationships with all
the banks and the distributors, plus, obviously, they have strong independent and captive agency forces in Japan. So it's
clear that there is an opportunity there and, you know, as Rob said earlier, I think what this transaction with MS&AD
does for us is it gives us the ability to focus on Alico in Japan and that's exactly what we plan to do.
<Q - Andrew Kligerman>: And it sounds much more promising. Then just shifting over to interest rate and we all
know that you'll kind of take a $0.20, maybe a $0.20 hit to what we would have been earning had interest rates not been
where they are. Can you walk us through to three years from now, four years from now, what would be the incremental
impact if the 10-year Treasury stays where it is? I don't know if it is – you know, you talked about how it's based on
spread compression, I guess it wouldn't be a focus on the 5.17% yield and where that would go, more on spread, but,
you know, in essence what would happen to expected earnings three years from now and would you be getting to your
long-term goal of 13-15% ROE?
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Andrew, it's Bill. That's a really
serious question and I hesitate to give an off the cuff answer. I think we'll do our best on Investor Day to really talk
through that issue with people if interest rates stay really low for a long time, but I would say a couple things. One is
these interest rate floors that we have that we're benefiting from today, obviously, and are really quite a good hedge
against this problem, those are going to be – those – the very first one of those expires in I think late 2014 and most of
them – often they go into 2015 and '16 so those are going to be there to help us for a very long time and so that's a good
thing.
The second question is, is obviously it is an earnings drag if things stay that low and for a long period of time and,
yeah, I do think that will make hitting our long-term ROE targets much more challenging but the other kind of, you
know, a little bit of a subjective wild card is while – will we -- you know, if we really get convinced that interest rates
will stay low for a long time will we start managing the business differently and I think the answer is absolutely but
how do you quantify that in terms of the numbers, I'm not really sure I can really do today. So I think that's – you
know, those are two things to keep in mind as we think about this potential issue.
<Q - Andrew Kligerman>: Perfect, that's very helpful. Real quickly, RBC and excess cash at the holdco post, the
Alico transaction, roughly where do you expect that to be?
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, it will be -- the cash at the
holdco will be three plus billion at year end, you know, at something -- year end. I think RBC, you know, I think as I've
said before we don't give out an interim RBC number, we do the full calculation once a year and that's frankly what
we're comfortable with. I would say this. You know our RBC ratio 432 at year-end 2009. It's clearly higher today. And
obviously that doesn't take into account cash at any holding company. So we've had good statutory earnings and at the
same time, you know, there aren't any other kind of extraneous issues which affect the RBC but we don't, you know,
we don't like to give an interim number out but it's clearly moving north.
<Q - Andrew Kligerman>: Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question we go to the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tom Gallagher>: Thanks. First question's for Steve. You commented on expecting strong 4Q private equity
returns. If we remain in the current environment do you think that's going to persist into 2011 or maybe just give some
overall views as to what you think is driving those returns and, you know, if nothing changes in the macro environment
whether it's likely to keep seeing those continue?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer>: Okay. I think part of what's
driving the returns this year relates to sales driven by improved capital markets around sub-debt and below investment
grade debt. That's allowing firms to either sell their businesses to other PE firms or industry players or do refinancings
and dividending out. So those markets I think are -- are driving a lot of that and people are searching for yield right now
because yields are so low, so, as of now, at least, those markets are quite robust and helping returns.
There's also some valuations being done that are showing improvements based upon higher equity pricing across the
board and that's really taking some very low valuations of a couple years ago during the crisis and kind of moving them
up on the equity methods. Those two things I think are keys.
The third probably is, you know, concern by people in the private equity world about their tax rates so accelerating
some profits now before their personal tax rates may go up based upon how tax -- the tax treatment of carried interest.
How much of that will go on into 2011, we're still doing some work on that, I'll have some numbers for you on Investor
Day, we'll provide you probably a range, again, like we did last year. We're finalizing those numbers now. So I'm
reluctant to give out an estimate before we finish our work.
<Q - Tom Gallagher>: Okay, so if I understood you correctly, maybe the one that would not be sustainable, the one
piece of it would be, you know, into 2011 there might not be the same incentive on the part of the actual private equity
owners to continue to monetize gains?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer>: It depends on policy issues
around tax and what happens in terms of Congressional action on that issue. So I think that's going to unfold over the
coming months.
<Q - Tom Gallagher>: Okay. And then the other question I had, actually two more quick ones. One, I guess, for
Donna, can you talk a bit about the bank earnings? They were very strong this quarter. Can you talk a bit about whether
these are sustainable? I think the comment was they were refi driven. Should we view these as really peak earnings that
are likely to come down or do you think there's sort of a higher baseline of earnings we've developed here? That's one
question.
Then lastly in terms of the low-interest rate environment, do you see any real signs of repricing yet by competitors for
things like variable annuities and universal life or do you think that's still to come? And that's it for me.
<A - Donna DeMaio>: Hi, this is Donna DeMaio from the bank. Yes, we did have a great third quarter, a lot of it is
driven by refis as well as the fact that margins are holding in the mortgage business. That is not sustainable. As the
mortgage market continues to come down, those who have refi – those who have the ability to refi have pretty much
tapped that out and we don't see that continuing into the fourth quarter or into 2011.
<A - William Mullaney>: Tom, I'll answer your question about the interest environment in one second. I want to get
back to a question we didn't answer that John Nadel raised about disability and what was happening with the discount
rate there on new claims. We don't disclose that discount rate publicly. I'll tell you that it's below 5% today, it has been
for some time. We continue to look at it and I would say based on -- we look at it semiannually, so based on the current
interest rate environment I'll tell you we will be looking at it again and it is under some pressure. So we'll let you know
in the future if we decide to make any changes to that discount rate.
In terms of interest rates overall and the impact on pricing, I don't think we've started to see it a lot yet, though, I think
we're going to see it if interest rates continue to stay low. I think that the marketplace may be staying on the sidelines a

little bit longer to see whether or not rates do stay low for a while. If they do I think we'll start to see that show up in
pricing but my own sense is it's just a little early yet to see it.

Our last question today comes from the line of Jeff Schuman from KBW, please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey Schuman>: Thank you, good morning. A couple of things, tax rate, you marked up the 2010 tax rate, I
was wondering if you could give us any perspective on 2011? And then secondly, any updates on retained asset
accounts in terms of either customer behavior or the level of sort of regulatory inquiry or where we stand there?
Thanks.
<A - William J. Wheeler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'll do the tax rate. As you heard
in my remarks, we've sort of moved up the effective tax rate. We started the year with a 27% effective tax rate. Given
sort of various factors we decided to move it up to 28%. I think for MetLife, when I think about 2011, you know,
MetLife pre-Alico probably the effective tax rate we should be thinking more like 29%, so maybe ticking up another
point. And it's not just – there's not one thing which is driving that, there are a couple of things.
In terms of – just keep in mind, though, Alico's effective tax rate, which isn't really changing is something like 34%,
and so the blended rate for the two companies will obviously be higher than MetLife standalone, but there is a little
pressure on the margin on tax rates.
<A - C. Robert Henrikson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Jeff, real quick, this is Rob, on the
retained asset accounts there's really nothing to report in terms of change of activity relative to regulatory and that sort
of thing. I would say that as I mentioned on the last call, we have a very, very, very high level of customer satisfaction
with those accounts and our cash flows would indicate that they're even more satisfied than they have been in the past
so other than that there's really nothing to add that this point.
<Q - Jeffrey Schuman>: So customers are continuing to utilize the accounts at about the same rate and there's no
change in withdrawals from existing accounts.
<A - C. Robert Henrikson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, remember to get in the
account you have to pass away so we don't have an open account for deposits but retention is actually drifting a little bit
higher than it has been in the past.
