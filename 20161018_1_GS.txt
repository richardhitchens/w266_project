Harvey Mitchell Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results and
I'm happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues were $8.2 billion; net earnings, $2.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.88; and our annualized return
on common equity was 11.2%. For the year to-date, net revenues were $22.4 billion; net earnings, $5.1 billion; earnings
per diluted share, $11.24; and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.
Relative to the first quarter of this year, the second and now the third quarter have shown steady improvements. This
improvement is reflected in third quarter revenues which increased 19% year-over-year. We also had a modest
sequential increase, which is particularly noteworthy given the third quarter is often seasonally slower.
A few factors contributed to the enhanced operating environment. The markets generally improved with equity prices
steadily moving higher. The S&P 500 was up 3.3% in the third quarter. The MSCI World increased by 4.8% and the
[ph] VIX (02:52) declined by 15%.
Credit spreads also tightened during the quarter with U.S. investment-grade and high-yield cash spreads tighter by 12
basis points and 87 basis points respectively. In addition, there weren't any major changes to the global economic
outlook over the course of the quarter. For example, consensus estimates for global GDP growth remained roughly
consistent. Ultimately, a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue
growth in three of our four business segments.
Now let's discuss them. Investment banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong
second quarter. Although revenues declined sequentially, our investment banking backlog remained robust and was up
versus last quarter. Breaking down the components of investment banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $650
million, down 17% compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined. Year-to-date,
Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter including ARM Holdings' $24.4
billion sale to SoftBank Group; AGL Resources' $12 billion merger with Southern Company; and Lockheed Martin's
$5 billion spin-off and merger of its IS & GS business into Leidos.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter including
WhiteWave Foods' $12.5 billion sale to Group Danone; Hewlett-Packard Enterprises' $8.8 billion spin-off and merger
of noncore software assets with Micro Focus International; and Abbott Medical Optics' $4.3 billion sale to Johnson &
Johnson.
Moving to underwriting, revenues were $879 million in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially due to a decline in
both debt and equity underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million, down 16% compared to the
second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance. However, the end of the quarter was significantly
more active than the beginning with more than half of the quarter's IPO volume occurring in September. Debt
underwriting revenues of $652 million were down 10% quarter-over-quarter following a robust second quarter. For the
first nine months of the year, debt underwriting produced record year-to-date results.
During the third quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of
China's $7.4 billion IPO; Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow on and convertible offering to support its purchase

of Westar; and Fortis' $2 billion investment-grade offering for the purchase of ITC.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were
$3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to the second quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $2
billion in the third quarter, up 2% sequentially. Credit increased and benefited from strong primary issuance and tighter
spreads. Mortgages also increased and included better market-making conditions given tighter spreads. Rates was down
slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential central bank actions. Currencies was
essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter with lower client activity, particularly post the Brexit vote. And
commodities declined during the quarter as activity remained light.
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the
third quarter were $1.8 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were
up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions. Commissions and fees were $719 million, down 3%
quarter-over-quarter. Securities services generated net revenues of $387 million, down 8% relative to the seasonally
stronger second quarter. Turning to risk, average daily volume in the third quarter declined to $57 million, down $5
million sequentially.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in
the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sales,
and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included
approximately $275 million of net interest income. In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues
of $1.5 billion, up 10% from the second quarter as incentive fees, management fees, and transaction revenues all
increased. Assets under supervision increased $37 billion sequentially to a record $1.35 trillion. The increase was due
to net market appreciation and net inflows. Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by
fixed income products.
Now let me turn to expenses. Year-to-date compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses,
amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits declined by 13%. This was roughly in line
with net revenues. The 13% year-to-date decline results in a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is 100
basis points lower in the firm's accrual in the first half of this year. Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1
billion, down slightly compared to the second quarter.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,900, roughly flat to the second
quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year to-date was 26.9%. Our global core liquid assets ended the third quarter at
$214 billion and our balance sheet was $880 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14% using the standardized
approach. It was 12.4% under the Basel III advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3%. In
the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1.3 billion.
In terms of capital, our ratios have significantly strengthened over the last several years. This reflects the
transformation of our balance sheet and our cumulative effort to de-risk the firm. All of these actions combined with
more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011 position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our
basic share count to its lowest point ever.
Before I wrap up, I want to cover three topics: our client franchise, expense initiatives, and new opportunities. With
respect to our global client franchise, it's in great shape. We have a strong position in each of our four segments:
Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, Investing & Lending, and Investment Management. While many of
our clients are currently challenged by the low growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them as they
look to navigate these headwinds.
On expenses, last quarter we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year.
We continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise.
Focusing on operating efficiency not only positions us for margin expansion and better environments, but it also
provides additional benefits. It allows the firm to maintain its global footprint and to continue to invest in the future,
which is an essential component of sustainable value creation.

While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our
businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle.
Additionally, our expense discipline allows us to invest in new opportunities. Last week we launched a new online
personal loan platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Marcus's goal is to enter the consumer credit market and provide a
product that is simple, transparent, flexible and provides consumers with real value.
Like any new effort, we are taking a slow and methodical approach with Marcus. We are leveraging all of the firm's
pre-existing strengths across risk management and technology, and we have brought in an experienced team of
consumer lending professionals to drive markets forward led by Harit Talwar.
Before taking your questions, I'd like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's
environment as we are on preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the
latter.
Thanks again for dialing in and I'm happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey. Morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good morning. So I appreciate the color around things related to FICC, and kind of a question of
overall backdrop. In the first quarter of 2015, the Swiss re-pegged, stuff went bonkers for a couple of weeks and you
made tons of money, even more than the overall industry. This quarter, it didn't seem like there was too many a-ha
moments. I mean, credit spreads tightened and we had the aftermath of Brexit and stuff. But in your text, you point out
low rates and slow economic growth as headwinds for FICC. You've talked about lower market volumes and volatility
and equities. I'm just curious, when you look at the quarter we just had in FICC particularly, is it more like you had a
nice pickup like first quarter of 2015 and you're setting us up for keep calm, like things have returned back to normal?
Or is this possibly a little bit higher activity environment given the uncertainty?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So it's a great question. Year-over-year, we were up 49% on a core basis. I think in
some respects that speaks to a weaker third-quarter environment last year. But I have to agree with you, I wouldn't say
it was a particularly strong quarter for FICC. Year-over-year I talked about some of the drivers. I would say maybe the
best way to describe it, it wasn't so much about tailwinds as it was about not having so many headwinds in the quarter.
And of course, it translated nicely for us.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Well, I'll take it if we get a little bit higher operating environment. One last one on I&L. It's
interesting that the pickup multiples were near their highs and you would expect a lot of exits. This one happened to be
a better quarter. You talked about some company specific sales and the up markets, but I guess the question is are you
finding opportunities to also put money to work, especially on the equity side. I saw the USC deal and I'm a huge
Conor McGregor fan, but that was close to the six times cap. So curious about how you see the investing environment
for I&L.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So the opportunities, for a while, have been more on the debt side. You've seen the
I&L balance sheet transition, when you see it again this quarter it's going to be close to 80% debt. But selectively, we're
certainly seeing opportunities whether they be in what we would call other forms of equity in real estate or other areas.
Selectively, we've seen some good opportunities in corporate equity. As you're probably seeing, we're in the market
now raising a fund, and the reception to that has been quite strong.

<Q - Glenn Schorr>: How big is the I&L balance sheet now? You said it's 80% fixed income, but it's over $100
billion now?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So just to give you the exact numbers, it's $98.9 billion, call it just under $99
billion. That's up $1.8 billion quarter-over-quarter. And I said almost 80%, it's 78% really debt and other assets, which
leaves you basically with $21.5 billion of what we would categorizes as equity.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: All right. Awesome. Thanks, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sure, Glenn. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Christian.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: So a question on your consumer lending efforts. Given the firm will be facing a very different
demographic than you have historically faced, can we just talk about how you think about reputational risk and how
you mitigate it?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah. So it's a great question. So I think the short answer is providing value to the
consumer. So one of the reasons we have said so many times that this is going to be a very deliberate, methodical
approach and a bit of crawl before we walk in this business is because we're well aware that this is a new effort for us.
Now some of this is not new for us. Our technology skills, the risk management, but the interface through the
technology with this new important client base, it's a different space for us. So we've hired, obviously, people with
decades of experience, but I think the greatest mitigating factor is slow growth, monitoring it very closely. But also,
when we put this together, we took input from consumers and it really is – I don't know if it's the first ever, but it really
is a lending product that is driven by consumer input.
And so that means providing them with flexibility, with real value, with simplicity. And that's why we've come out
with something – and we got feedback, consumers don't necessarily like and they understand the fee structures so we
created a no-fee product. No small print. If you call our call centers, people pick up. Some of these things sound simple,
but they're quite important in terms of what consumers want. And if you deliver what consumers want and you really
control your processes, then obviously you create value and you deliver what regulators want also
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just a cleanup question. On the buyback, $1.2 billion in
the quarter which was a bit lower than the first half run rate. I know the last CCAR cycle, buybacks were back-end
weighted. How should we think about the pace for this cycle?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So you're right, a year ago there were some idiosyncrasies to the task which led to a
more back-end weighted profile. This year, we have a bit of flexibility in terms of how we'll approach the next couple
of quarters but a lot of this is going to be driven by, as you know, the environment and demand for balance sheet. We
would really like to start putting our capital to work if the environment improved from where it is today. But certainly,
there's some flexibility in the profile for us to go up a little bit from these levels. But again, certainly not committing to
that. You know how we think about capital management and share repurchase for us is not to be equated with
dividends and so it's going to be dynamic.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Thank you, Harvey.

Your next question is from the Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Thanks, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Hey. Just first question on capital ratios. Your ratio continues to improve based on
some recent comments by the Tarullo and where CCAR is heading maybe into 2018. Has anything changed in how you
manage through that process? And then just with your last comment on the last question on balancing buybacks versus
investments, are you starting to see some opportunities to make investments? Maybe it's because of market share
opportunities globally, but just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So again on the ratios, as I mentioned, 1,400 are standardized and 1,200 are
advanced. By the way, just while I have you, because I know I'll get the question, Mike. It's 13.4% standardized fully
phased and 11.9% on the advanced fully phased.
In terms of the stress testing, white paper and Governor Tarullo's comments, I'd say, at a high level, obviously they put
a ton of work into this with various constituencies. Our initial impressions were the framework seemed quite
thoughtful. And it seems somewhat consistent with the way we actually manage the firm. So we manage the firm,
obviously, on a forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress test, but we obviously also manage the spot capital
ratios. And under our spot capital ratios as you can see, we have lots of capacity. And so, we'll have to see ultimately
the details in the NPR, but again they did the right thing here by giving the banks the opportunity to make adjustments
because as you know this won't be incorporated into the 2017 cycle.
And so to the extent in which firms need to adapt [ph] or (23:06) be able to adapt after we see the NPR, but I think our
starting point puts us in a great position. And again, the treatment of share repurchase and we'll see what happens with
balance sheet and other things, but we'll take our normal approach in terms of capital management from here, but it
seems like the right direction.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on I&L, when you look at some of the things
that the Fed has put out there on, like, physical commodities and some of the pressures on that part of the market versus
what you guys have been doing on the debt side, just where do you see the outlook based on maybe some of these
potential changes, the increase in RWAs and what you can still grow versus what could potentially be at risk?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So that's a great question. In terms of – why don't we just talk about the
commodities NPR. So the market's been waiting for this for a while. As you know, we've been in the commodity
business for decades, and we think it's really important that the Federal Reserve has taken the lead here in terms of an
important area of focus for us and the industry, but especially as it relates to ultimately establishing uniform standards
across the industry, so we welcome all that. With respect to our business, we've obviously been very vocal in our
commitment to the commodity business, and sometimes I think maybe that gets misunderstood.
So I want to underscore it for you a bit. What we're committed to is serving our clients and their needs. And you can
unpack that a bit and simplify it by saying there's really three activities that are critical to our clients. It's critical for
them to hedge. And that's consumers and producers who have commodity price exposure. Financing of those
businesses is critical. And then obviously, market-making activities which provide liquidity to the markets and are a
critical component of making those markets function. That's what we're most committed to. You've seen over the years
we've been reducing on balance sheet, investing in commodities.
And so, we'll work with the industry and with regulators like we would in any NPR process. But we're most focused on
ensuring that those services, from a Goldman Sach's perspective and across the industry, can get provided to clients in a
safe and cost-effective way, no different than we would approach any of the NPRs.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the targeted customer base
for the new lending platform in terms of FICO scores, income or however you're defining it?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah. So with this launch and with this one product, we're focused on the prime
borrower base.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And I guess how do you define prime? I mean, it's a pretty big segment overall.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So we would define it broadly for you. Let's just say above 660 FICO category.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just over time, will you provide more disclosures on this? Because
as I step back and look at some of the names I cover, this seems like it could be one of the kind of meaningful new
initiatives that's out there in terms of changing the profile of the company a little bit. And I think more disclosures over
time would be helpful to be able to track the performance.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sure. We're happy as it grows, obviously, as it becomes more meaningful. I mean,
just to underscore this, I got an email last evening that we've booked our first loan. So if you want to consider that
continuous updating of financial disclosure, Matt. But I don't mean to make light of your question. Obviously, as it
grows and becomes more meaningful, we'll spend more time with you on it. I think the important thing now is that we
make sure that everyone understands the product, the pace we expect to move at, which would be very deliberate and
slow. And that, in terms of returns long term, if that's kind of where you're getting, obviously I've talked a lot about the
consumer here, but we built this business to be accretive in the long run to Goldman Sachs' returns. But we're happy to
keep you updated.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then completely unrelated, any color on the regional performance
within fixed income trading this quarter?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No. There was nothing specific that jumped out. It was really more across the
products. But it wasn't anything, particularly in the regional cuts.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey. Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. In the past you've mentioned that you felt some competitors were having a more permanent
retreat from the markets. Did you see some of the benefit of share gains this quarter as part of your capital markets
revenue? And also your comp ratio was up 100 basis points year-over-year. Are you trying to hire more people or pay
more in an effort to gain share?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So with respect to the market share, certainly over the course of the past year, I
would say there's been periods, particularly things like some of our core strengths, prime brokerage, in fixed income.
Across the region we've seen discrete shifts in market share. I would say when we look at it in terms of the core
businesses, for example, like in credit, as we monitor those market shares, certainly with certain client segments like

asset managers, it feels like we're picking up market share.
Again, one of the difficult things about market share is you really need volume to grow. And even though obviously
our performance this year is significantly better than last year, it's the best quarter we've had in five quarters, you really
need activity levels to pick up from here. Now just in terms of the second part of your question, the 41% at this point in
time is our best estimate. We told you forever that as a conceptual matter you should expect in periods were revenues to
decline that compensation and benefits expense should lag that. And obviously, we've talked to you a ton about
operating leverage. And so if revenues grow, you should also expect compensation and benefit and expect to lag that
growth because of the operating leverage. But at this stage, 41% on output.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And one follow-up, Brexit, is this a chance to gain additional share or is this just pain that
everybody has to share? And do you think more business shifts to the U.S.?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I would say that Brexit potentially is something that could drive share to the U.S. I
think what we've witnessed over the last several years is U.S. firms like ourselves with really strong markets share and
leading business positions, whether you look at FICC, investment banking, equities, asset management. If you're a
leader in a franchise throughout this cycle, particularly as activity picks up, I think there is share to gain. I think our
European clients need us, but in terms of Brexit I think it's unclear whether that's having any impact at this stage. It
feels like early days.

Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Betsy. How are you?
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey. Good. I just had a couple questions looking at the VaR that you guys put out in
your note, obviously, in the press release. It seems like volatility actually came down a bit in certain segments and yet
the VaR came down as well. And I look at this and I'm thinking is there an opportunity for you to allocate a little bit
more in this environment and continue to generate some nice size trading revenues?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I think that observation is correct. I think what's most important about that
observation is just the capacity we have under the capital ratios, so obviously. But again, VaR is going to be driven by
market volatilities and by client demand. And as client demand picks up or as market volatilities pick up, certainly you
would expect that to translate through. But we're not feeling constrained at all, really only by the macro environment
and our client appetite at this stage.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: So in this past quarter it was more a function of client demand pulling back because it
feels like you have the capital capacity to have had more VaR allocated this past quarter?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: When you look at it in terms of – so are you talking about year over year or
sequentially? If you look at it more sequentially, it's kind of a mix of volatility levels coming down on what I'll call
position changes. If you look at it year-over-year, it's more about position changes.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Yeah.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I think your big point is this environment wasn't a particularly strong environment.
Again, it's the third quarter. It's got some of the seasonal characteristics.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Yeah. Okay. And then just secondly on Asia, could you give us a sense as to how you
guys are reorienting your Asia franchise? I noticed that there was some head count changes over there and some
management changes. So could you give us a sense as to what the strategy is for that region?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So as you remember on the last call we talked about the expense initiatives we
launched in the first half which translated through to a $700 million run rate savings. Anything you're reading in the
press is a bit distorted. This process in Asia is just a continuation of the process that has been ongoing for the rest of the
firm. In terms of Asia, completely committed to the region.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: That make sense. I'm just saying I think there was also a comment around the head of
Asia was changing, and so wondered if there was a shift in focus on...
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No. They're completely unrelated events. If you were sitting at management with
me yesterday, you would've heard Mark talk about how he joined the firm in 1976, and he just felt this was the
appropriate time for him. But no, they're completely unrelated in terms of – there's nothing strategic in that.

Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: I wanted to just follow up on the I&L questions. Specifically, maybe you just give us some
color, maybe some examples of how you have been continuing to see the equity balances to offset the gains harvesting
that you've been doing over the past couple of years, because you've harvested quite a bit and yet you've been able to
maintain that asset line item in the $21 billion, $21.5 billion range. And sort of in the context of that, maybe you can
comment on some of the recent proposals or requests that the Fed has made for congressional action to tighten up
Volcker?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So in terms of the I&L balance sheet, again, you were right to point out that the $21
billion, $21.5 billion had been relatively constant. Obviously, that's from a smaller component of the balance sheet. As
I mentioned before, it's close to 80%. That 80% is really lending and other items. And I don't have details in front of me
to give you blow by blow breakdowns on where reinvestments are occurring. Obviously, corporate private equity has
been slow over the past couple of years, but that $21.5 billion, 20% of that now is made up of real estate globally, and
so that's been a meaningful participant.
Now why have you generally not seen the asset class going lower? Obviously, it's a bit of a high class problem. The
assets have been performing, the markets have been generally going up over the last couple of years, and you've seen
that performance out of the I&L segment. But that's part of the gives and the gets.
In terms of – I don't think you're as much talking about Volcker as you're talking about the Fed discussion with
Congress. It's very early days and we'll see how that evolves. Was that your question?
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah. I think that there was some – before the commodities NPR came out, the Fed had also,
I think, made some noises about asking for congressional guidance I guess on cutting back on merchant banking that's
allowed within Volcker. And I was wondering if you had some sense of whether you would be able to continue to feed
that equity line and keep it in the range that it's been in or grow it if in fact there were further restrictions on merchant
banking.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Well, obviously the opportunities exist. We think we're providing an important
layer of capital, but these conversations will evolve. And it's super early so there would be no way for us to interpret or

give you any guidance on that.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. I guess the other question also I&L-related is – and this has to do with the
negative operating leverage comment that you had made for the firm broadly. So for the nine months your revenues are
down, your comp is down not as much, maybe a couple of percentage points differential, which is a negative operating
leverage. But the biggest component of the revenue decline has been I&L. And I guess my question is, if I&L had
declined in line with the rest of the firm, would it be possible to keep the comp declining in line as well? In other
words, would you have been able to maintain your margin better if it hadn't been I&L that was driving the revenue
down?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So on the compensation and benefits expense, you're right. So revenues were down
15% year-to-date, and compensation and benefits expense down 13%. Now I wouldn't – I mean, maybe you would
characterize that as negative operating leverage. I don't know that that's meaningful negative operating leverage. And
the reason we were able to achieve that almost lockstep decline was because of the expense initiatives we launched in
the beginning of the year.
In terms of the contribution of an individual segment, we look at this as a firm-wide collective as we go through the
compensation process. And obviously, compensation as we've repeated to you many times before, it's about
performance but it's also about managing the company for the long-term and executing our strategy for the long-term.
So it's not going to be – our compensation process is not going to be driven by one segment's contribution one way or
another.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it.

Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Fiona.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: I just wanted to ask – good morning – about pricing. You mentioned – we talked about
market share but have you seen, given that some banks are putting less capital to work than others, any impact on
pricing in any of your products? And there's the follow-up as well on the tax rate, now that it's come in lower again,
what you're thinking about for the future? Thank you.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So in pricing, at the margin it's very business specific. We have seen, in some
cases, what I'll call rational repricing and things like prime brokerage. But again, in this low-volume environment, I
don't know how much of that you'll see. In other words, the same low-volume low-growth environment we have
globally that's contributing to what looks like in the future an extraordinarily strong competitive environment for our
businesses is the same thing that doesn't allow for a lot of price improvement.
And so I think it's one of these things where even though this has taken a while, you need an environment that is
challenged for a while or to get competitive retreats, but the same challenges don't allow for price adjustment. Maybe
over time you see price adjustments, but certainly in things the more capital-intensive parts of the business like prime
brokerage where we're a market leader. In terms of tax, I think in terms of your estimates, obviously, it'll be driven by
regional contributions, but I would say 28% to 29%, that range.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Jim. How are you?
<Q - James Mitchell>: Hey. Good. How you doing, Harvey?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: [ph] You bet (41:22).
<Q - James Mitchell>: Maybe just a question on Asia, I guess, in a more positive way. You have the Hong
Kong-Shenzhen connect going into place later this year. It seemed like when the Hong Kong-Shanghai connect went
in, you guys had a nice boost in equity trading, the industry did, in the first half of 2015. Do you expect something
similar this time around?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I don't know necessarily. If you have a strong view in terms of the immediate, I do
think that, over the intermediate term, it's an important development. I think more broadly, while it might not be a
straight path to increasing volumes, I think more broadly, in Asia, our perspective is, and with China, that we're on a
long upward trajectory of activity. And our role and ability to work with clients in the region, whether it is [ph] trading
(42:14), advisory, capital raising, this just feels like a very long positive trajectory, but it's not going to be straight-line.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Right. Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up on the pipeline. You guys did note
you're down year-over-year, is that mostly M&A? And can you give any color on what you're seeing in terms of the
outlook on the pipeline?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So the pipeline feels pretty good when you talk to our M&A team, and the backlog
sequentially was up not down. But the activity levels that I mentioned in terms of completed transactions in the market,
obviously down over year after very, very healthy levels. The best perspective I can share with you is the one I get from
talking to our M&A bankers and it hasn't shifted much over the course of the year.
The same fundamental factors that are contributing to the last two years of M&A activity, generally low top-line
growth, a desire to drive efficiencies, access to the capital markets, all those factors feel in place. Now, regionally, the
U.S. feels more active than Europe, and Asia feels a bit more active than Europe, but I'm giving you really very
localized commentary. Long-term, it feels like the fundamental factors are in place.
<Q - James Mitchell>: And the underwriting side of the equation?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So in underwriting as you saw, we've had a strong debt performance. We had a
record for the first nine months of this year on a year-to-date basis. I mentioned before that half the IPO volume or a
meaningful portion of the IPO volume actually occurred in September.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Right.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So it does feel like we are starting now to get into a market where a lot of that
activity that got pushed from the first quarter into the second quarter, that still exists. So we feel real reasonably good
about activity levels in the capital markets on an intermediate basis.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay, great. Thanks.

mandate? I mean, is it global or North American? Is it pure corporate equity or is it broader? And then I guess as a
follow-on to that, if it's $5 billion to $8 billion, the Blackstones and Apollos of the world are raising, like, $18
billion-plus. So what's the strategy to put the money to work? Is it to go more middle-market, to do fewer deals or to
bring in more co-investors? Those kinds of [ph] decisions (45:07)?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No. Happy to talk about it. I don't know if I'll get to all of your questions, but let
me just give you the high level. So we are in the market, there's really two fundamental reasons why we decided to
engage in a fund raise. One was really to have a full offering for our private wealth clients. And the second is if you
look at the capital regime, particularly under CCAR as it relates to private equity, corporate equity specifically, those
capital requirements continue to edge up, so they're giving us the flexibility to utilize the funds and to provide that to
our clients. It seemed like it made a ton of sense.
Now in terms of the fund size, we have been talking about $5 billion to $8 billion. That's what the team feels is the
right size for the horizon they're thinking about, so they're not looking to raise the largest one in the world despite the
fact that there's been very significant interest in terms of how we're approaching it. And in terms of its focus, its focus
will be on corporate private equity.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Okay. And should we assume that you will commit 3% to it, and is it the standard kind of asset
management, [ph] one in 20 (46:19) and I assume that these will show up on the asset management side. And then kind
of related to that, is this all a wealth management, asset management standalone business that's walled off from
investment banking, or can there be cross-pollination between the two?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Well, the activities allow for us obviously to work with our investment bankers, but
it [ph] isn't (46:45) an asset management driven product and it's Volcker compliant in its design.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Okay. All righty. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning. So first question on non-comp, I think you guys took a charge here
in occupancy. Is there some benefit that we should see flowing through in subsequent quarters from that occupancy
charge this quarter?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah. So we took a $63 million charge. This relate to one asset that we leased out.
The run rate on that is small but generally speaking, when we look at these things we look for a reasonably short term
in terms of payback in terms of recouping those expenses, but this has been something we were just waiting for the
market to recover, but it's a small item.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. And then hoping to ask a follow-up for your previous comments on FICC. I
know – I think you commented that the quarter wasn't a particularly strong one even though the year-over-year growth
was good and that it seemed like you commented that you're gaining share in FICC, at least among some market
participants. But if we look at year-to-date trends in revenue, it does look like some of the U.S. money center banks are
growing double-digit-plus over 2015 year-to-date, whereas Goldman's revenue is down. Can you help us understand
maybe why that's diverging? Is it a business mix issue? Is there something else going on? Are you guys shifting away
from certain clients or what have you? Just maybe any help you can give us there, Harvey, it'd be great.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah. It's no problem. I think that's more environment specific, and there could be
some aspects of different footprint. All these businesses at this stage in FICC, and again we don't have much visibility
into competitors. They're all very different. I mean, some of these are enormous balance sheets, some of them are very
big in emerging markets and some are not. I think when you look at it, I wouldn't overemphasize the first quarter of
2015, which I think is really the factor that's influencing your math.

And again, I wouldn't overemphasize the performance that we had in the third quarter either because things just don't
shift that quickly. I think that the third quarter was solid for us, but as I talked about currencies, commodities, it was
down year-over-year. So it certainly wasn't an environment we were hitting on all cylinders. And even with that, we
were in a double-digit ROE environment. So it feels pretty good to us and the momentum feels good.

Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hey, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Wanted to start off with just a follow-up question relating to the earlier merchant banking
discussion. Recognize that many of the recommendations are in fact just that that have come from the regulators. But
just thinking about the strategy for this business longer term, looking at the activities more broadly, it's been a very
good profit source historically but it also consumes significant amounts of capital. And under a CCAR lens, some of
the specs related, it could even be ROE dilutive overall. And I was wondering, given the current backdrop and some of
the hiding regulatory scrutiny, whether you've considered strategic alternatives for the business such as an IPO or a spin
that could generate value while maybe allowing for some degree of regulatory unshackling.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I think you're right to underscore, which I mentioned earlier, the fact that over
time, the CCAR requirements under – let's just use private equity investing and corporate equity have certainly
increased. Now the nice thing about that analytic framework is it's perfectly transparent. You know what the global
market shocks are, et cetera. So you can certainly evaluate investments that you're making. Now we're talking about
investments at the bottom part of the capital structure. And so in terms of the return profile, we're obviously very
selective about how we deploy that capital. But as I mentioned before, one of the nice things about launching this fund
is it does give us flexibility in terms of how to think about deploying that capital, and it creates a new important product
for our clients. So we have options.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Got it. Okay. That's very helpful color, Harvey. Thank you.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sure.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: And maybe just one follow-up on the capital side. Actually, shifting over to denominator,
it's quite evident that you've made significant strides in mitigating your standardized RWAs. I think it's down about
15% since the end of 2014, but the advanced risk-weighted assets have actually crept higher. I know some of that's
going to be a function of increases in op risk but I was hoping you could speak to any mitigation potential that you can
achieve on the advanced risk-weighted assets moving forward, particularly if the Collins floor does end up applying to
some of the new proposed capital changes that Tarullo spoke to in his recent remarks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah. So as I mentioned on the advanced transitional, we're at 12.4% under the
current capital regime. Obviously, that gives us more than enough capacity. We obviously have things that roll off and
things like that, but not material enough for me to highlight for you. But to the extent to which – I think at this stage
whether you look at the supplementary leverage ratio, standardized, advanced, we have the tools in place through our
return on attributed equity framework, the ROA framework which we talked a lot about – we have the tools in place at
this stage, and more importantly the culture, the people engagement across the entire firm. We will adapt if needed but
right now, we feel we have more than enough capacity.

Your next question's from the line a Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Just a couple of quick ones. You mentioned that there was – the strongest inflow of
AUM in the quarter was in fixed income. Any color as to what was driving that and if those were – was that all
liquidity or was it slightly higher margin flow?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No. So liquidity products, I believe, was up $2 billion in the quarter, so this was
long-term fee-based assets that were really the driver. And the team has done a very good job in their advisory
businesses and so that, I would say, would be the more meaningful part of the driver in terms of this quarter's flows.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. And just circling back to another question previously asked. In terms – if I back
out the charge that you took in occupancy this quarter, it looks like – and as well as litigation, it looks like you're
running in the last couple of quarters at around 24%, 25% non-comp to revenue ratio. I understand revenue can be a bit
volatile, but it's been trending prior to that at 30%-plus. Is 25% a new run rate, or is it really going to depend – should
we really think more about the dollar value rather than the ratio?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: We don't target a ratio. You should think of the ratio as an output. Now obviously,
we have been very diligent around expenses over the last couple of years reflecting the environment. If you happen to
have a lot of historical financials, you would see that market development this quarter was under $100 million. I think
it's the lowest it's been in seven years. So obviously, we've been very focused on this. But we don't target a ratio, and a
big driver obviously is BC&E, and if you saw big activity pick up, that would move with the environment as well. But
we're very focused on expenses, as you know.

<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi, Harvey. Just to step back for a moment, can we just talk about how we should sort of
contemplate revenue growth across the mix of businesses more broadly? Because I look at what's happened this quarter
and sort of what's occurred over the course of the year, and in the underwriting businesses and in the advisory business,
obviously you know the statistics much better than I, but advisory may be moving to a new lower plateau than what
we've seen recently. And with all of the cross-currents running through the trading environment and through the
investing environment, how do we contemplate the overall go-forward mix of business?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I think we don't target a mix, as you know. We focus on the clients in those
businesses where, as you know, we have leading market positions, and so we feel good about that. I think it's a bit more
of what your expectation for the environment is. We control the micro issues we can focus on, our client engagement,
expenses, capital management, but a lot of the things are outside of our control. And I would say that in aggregate,
when you look at the vast majority of our businesses, this is not an extraordinary environment. I mean, despite the fact

that the third quarter performance was strong on a relative basis, there's lots of challenges regionally. You could
certainly envision an environment that was significantly better from where we are today.
You've heard us say this a lot, but we root for growth. And an environment of negative interest rates in vast parts of the
world is not indicative of a world that's growing at a great pace. So you can see much better environments than we have
today and we hope that ends up being the case.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: But just from a planning perspective, I mean is there any reason to think that that – or that
this environment, that those policy dynamics are changing over, let's say, a medium-term horizon?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Just like I think they could change always pretty quickly for the negative, and we
tend to be more contingency planners. You could certainly see things break for the high side. Obviously, rates could
move back into positive territory, which would be an indicator. And there's been speculation in the market that we
might be more on the cusp of that in the United States.
I think the most important takeaway is whether or not we move into that environment in the near-term, we're
incorporating all those current factors in how we're running the firm today, which in a pretty muted environment, we're
able to grow revenues, demonstrate a double-digit ROE. And we truly believe we are well-positioned in the franchise
with significant operating leverage if the environment improves. So we feel quite good about our position, but we are
rooting for a better environment for everybody.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And if I could just sneak in one last one on Marcus. Most firms that do some kind of
lending typically have a 2.5% to 3% pre-tax ROA. Are you – how does that compare with what it is you're targeting?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So that's perfectly consistent with what we're able to generate. Of course, we don't
have any legacy infrastructure or cost structure. This is all white sheet of paper for us, so we'll see how it evolves. But
that's certainly achievable.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line a Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Thanks. Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey. How are you, Devin?
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Good. So it seems like we're speaking a lot more about your technology footprint on these calls,
and you've been increasingly highlighting a number of those capabilities. So when we look at some those initiatives
like Marcus or Symphony, Marquee or consolidating the electronic trading book across businesses, and maybe I missed
something there, but where do you see the most immediate opportunities to actually move the needle? And I guess
that's part one. And part two is, as you think about future investments into technology, do you think more of the
incremental spend from here is going to be more offensive positioning, revenue-producing rather than defensive?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So it's a great question. I would say that broadly speaking, and this won't be
completely inclusive, but I think you can define our technology strategy as focused on client engagement and those
tools and services we can deliver to clients that provide differentiated value to those clients. And you see that doing us
in our capital markets businesses, and obviously you see us creating that with Marcus.
Two, there are times when we feel like given our core technology skills, we're in a position to develop technology
which will be better enhanced outside of the firm ultimately, even though we've incubated it in the firm. And
Symphony would be a great example of that. We feel like as an information-sharing platform with better security,
better compliance controls, we felt like that was something better utilized by a broad range of market participants.

And lastly, our own technology internally is quite important for making us more efficient and adapting to regulatory
change and managing our risk, and that's obviously been very core to what we do. So we look across all three of those
different platforms, if you will, for the lack of better language. I would say the most important thing in addition to
controlling the firm is our client engagement, and Marcus reflects that trend as it relates to consumers.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Got it. That's great. Very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Just any update on the
momentum in deposit gathering within the online bank, just how that has been? I don't know if you could give any
numbers there, but how that's been maybe relative to expectations now that we're a little ways away from the launch.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So it's more than exceeded our expectations. I think in the past quarter we picked
up another $1 billion of deposits and so the momentum there feels quite good. And the team's done an excellent job of
transitioning the platform into Goldman.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Hey, Harvey. Actually, I'm all good. All my questions were asked. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Okay, great. Thanks, Brian.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Yeah.

And your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: I wanted to go back to the comp ratio and what you said earlier about that as revenues go higher,
the comp ratio should drift kind of lower. And as we're having lower revenues this year, the comp ratio should probably
drift a little bit higher than it was last year. Is that the concept you were really pushing forward earlier?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So this is completely consistent, Marty, as you know. You've been following us
forever. In terms of, broadly speaking – and it may not be the case in any given year – but broadly speaking, we've
encouraged you to expect that compensation and benefits expense will lag revenue moves.
So you've seen it through the year to-date. 41% is our best estimate, but revenues are down 15%, compensation and
benefits expense down 13%. In environments where revenues are up, base case you should expect a lag in that direction
also, particularly given how much we've emphasized operating leverage with you.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: That's what I thought. It's just been spoiled the last two years with revenues being fairly
consistent on a year-on-year basis.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, we like it spoiled, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: The other thing I was going to ask you was you had mentioned you had four businesses, which is
outlined on your income statement very clearly. When you talk about the new consumer business and lending, really

doesn't fit into any of those four. You kind of feel like you could put deposits maybe in asset management, but are you
thinking about this as devolving into a fifth business, or how would you tuck it into your overall strategic mix today?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So three of the four segments are up this year, obviously. The one segment which
we worked hard to unpack for everybody is investing in lending, and this would very naturally fall into the lending
segment. Obviously, the extent to which down the road as an activity in and of itself if it had material contribution, we
could talk about highlighting more but I think it'll get a lot of attention as it grows anyway. It's pretty exciting.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Got you. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thanks, Marty.

So since there are no more questions, I just really want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call.
Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If any additional
questions come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane or the team. Otherwise, please enjoy the rest of your day
and I look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Take care, everyone, and thanks
