Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Johnson & Johnson Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All
participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being
recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]
I'd now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.
Louise Mehrotra
Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it
is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2014. Joining me on the call today
are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; Joaquin Duato, Worldwide
Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, and Worldwide Chairman,
Pharmaceuticals; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I'll begin by briefly reviewing second quarter results for
the corporation and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will provide some additional
commentary on the business and an update on our near-term priorities. Next Joaquin and Paul will provide an update on

our Pharmaceutical business and lastly Dominic will review the income statement and provide guidance for 2014. We
will then open the call to your questions.
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or
businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the
press release. Please note we will be using presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also
available on our website.
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered
forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's
actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company
does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or
developments. The 10-K is available through the company and online.
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables
reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.
A number of the products and compounds to be discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic
partners or licensed from other companies. This slide lists the acknowledgment of those relationships not otherwise
referenced in today's presentations. Now I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2014.
Worldwide sales to customers were $19.5 billion for the second quarter of 2014, up 9.1%. On an operational basis,
sales were up 9.4% and currency had a negative impact of 0.3%. In the U.S., sales were up 14.9%. In regions outside
the U.S., our operational growth was 5% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported
results by 0.6%.
On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 6.5%, Asia Pacific/Africa Region grew
5.3% and Europe grew 4.1%. The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products made strong
contributions to the results in all regions. Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisitions, underlying organic
operational growth was 10%.
Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.51 versus $1.33 a year ago. As
referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a
charge of $449 million for after-tax special items. Second quarter 2013 net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge
of $456 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.
Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per
share were $1.66, representing increases of 11.3% and 12.2% respectively as compared to the same period in 2013.
Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in
comparison to the second quarter of 2013 unless otherwise stated and, therefore, exclude the translational impact of
currency. I'll begin with the Consumer segment.
Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.7 billion increased 3.6 % with U.S. sales down 0.5% while outside the U.S.
sales grew 5.8%. Excluding the impact of net divestitures worldwide growth was approximately 6% with U.S. growth
of approximately 5%. Major drivers of the results were over-the-counter products, skincare, baby care, as well as
international sales of oral care and feminine protection products partially offset by the divestiture of the North
American Sanitary Protection business.
OTC sales were strong due to analgesic growth of nearly 17% worldwide and nearly 25% in the U.S. driven by market
share gains as we continue to return products to the shelves. Upper respiratory products, digestive health and
anti-smoking products also made strong contributions to the results. Skincare results were driven by share gains for
both NEUTROGENA and AVEENO with new product launches supported by robust marketing campaigns, category
growth, as well as an increase in trade inventory levels. Baby care results were driven by strong sales across a number

of categories. International Oral Care results were driven by strong results for LISTERINE due to new product
launches and successful marketing campaigns.
Moving now to our Pharmaceuticals segment, worldwide sales of $8.5 billion increased 21.1% with the U.S. up 36.6%
and sales outside the U.S. up 6.9% driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. A
major driver was our recently launched hepatitis C product called OLYSIO in the U.S. and E.U. and SOVRIAD in
Japan. Excluding sales of the hepatitis C products OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying growth worldwide U.S. and
outside the U.S. was approximately 10.5%, 15% and 6.5% respectively.
Other significant contributors to growth were immunology products, STELARA, REMICADE and SIMPONI,
SIMPONI ARIA as well as XARELTO, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVOKANA, PREZISTA and
recently launched IMBRUVICA. Partially offsetting the growth were lower sales of ACIPHEX and CONCERTA due
to generic competition and INCIVO with competitive entries.
The strong results for Immunology were driven by double-digit market growth complemented by increased market
share for STELARA and SIMPONI. We continue to be the U.S. market leader in Immunology. XARELTO sales were
up over 90% compared with the same quarter last year and grew over 13% on a sequential basis. Total prescription
share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to over 13% with cardiology TRx estimated at over
23%.
The strong results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. were driven by increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate
resistant prostate cancer market and estimated market growth of nearly 11.5%. ZYTIGA has captured approximately
34% of that market. Continued strong market uptick and progress on reimbursement drove strong the strong result
outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 90 countries.
Increased market share drove results for INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and PREZISTA. INVOKANA sales
contributed over 2.5 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate and for the quarter achieved 2.3% TRx within the
defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, up from 1.8% in the first quarter of 2014. TRx
with endocrinologists grew to 7% for the quarter, up approximately 1% sequentially.
I'll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics
segment sales of $7.2 billion increased 0.9%. U.S. sales declined 1.4% while sales outside the U.S. increased 2.6%.
Growth was driven by Orthopedics, Cardiovascular Care and Specialty Surgery, partially offset by lower sales in
Diabetes Care, Vision Care and Diagnostics.
Lower price primarily related to competitive bidding continue to impact the Diabetes Care business in the U.S., while
reversal of the noted customer inventory build from the first quarter and competitive pricing dynamics impacted growth
for Vision Care. Excluding OCD and Diabetes Care, worldwide growth was approximately 2%.
Orthopedic sales growth was driven by Trauma and Hips. Trauma was up 7% worldwide with sales outside the U.S. up
11% due to a successful tender offer as a result of our comprehensive portfolio offering. Hips growth of 5% worldwide
was driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were a
major contributor to the results.
Knees worldwide increased 1% with the U.S. flat and 4% growth outside the U.S. Increased sales due to the successful
launch of ATTUNE were partially offset by price pressures across the region and softness in the U.S. market.
Cardiovascular growth was driven by a 14% worldwide increase in our Biosense Webster business due to new catheter
launches and continued market expansion.
Specialty Surgery results were driven by Energy and Biosurgery outside the U.S. with new products driving market
growth and market share. There were some notable developments in the second quarter, which we have summarized on
this slide to assist as you develop your models. Alex, Joaquin, and Paul will provide some additional commentary in
their remarks. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter of 2014.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?

Alex Gorsky
Well, thank you very much, Louise, and thanks to all of you who are participating in today's call. Welcome. It's a very
dynamic time in the healthcare industry led most importantly by significant advancements in the care of patients and
consumers. Treatment options have never been greater.
Today, hepatitis C and certain cancer treatments are more promising than ever, and while diabetes and heart disease,
which are unfortunately still seeing rates increase, they're much more manageable for the patient with oral medications
that are increasingly convenient to take. Now that being said, all of us in healthcare realize that there's still so much
more work to do to improve the lives of patients around the world.
And it's encouraging to see that healthcare reform initiatives are taking hold around the world which will enable more
people to see a doctor or to have a procedure they needed, they may not have had the means to do so in the past. Over
the past several years, we've been discussing with you how Johnson & Johnson has been taking a consistent series of
steps to ensure we are best positioned to serve the needs of patients and consumers in this dynamic and
rapidly-evolving environment. I'd like to begin our discussion today by reviewing some of these issues.
Much as we had anticipated the medical devices landscape is evolving as innovation, scale and breadth become more
important to meeting the needs of the customer. At that time we noted that due to market dynamics in segments like
orthopedics the industry would likely need to consolidate, which was one factor that led to our acquisition of Synthes.
In the larger device space, what the industry is now realizing is that companies like Johnson & Johnson with larger
portfolios are better able to partner with hospital systems and managed care organizations to find the right balance of
innovation, value and service.
And as we are all observing, there are many dynamics happening in the pharmaceutical industry as well. We noted
several years ago that a focused portfolio, consistent investments in R&D and overall increased productivity in our
development capabilities would be the key to driving our innovation. Since making the decision to focus our portfolio
on five therapeutic areas where our expertise and the opportunity to make a significant difference aligned, our
pharmaceutical business has been exceptionally productive with 14 new compounds launched since 2009 making it the
fastest growing of the top ten pharmaceutical businesses in the U.S., Europe and Japan. These innovations and indeed
the innovations that we're making in each of our segments enables us to meet the growing demand for healthcare
products and services and creates new opportunities to address unmet medical needs.
I want to now briefly review our perspective on where we see healthcare today. As I mentioned in January, the
worldwide market is immense with an overall spend of over $8 trillion. At $2.4 trillion, products account for nearly
30% of the spend, growing at about 3% to 5% a year. In medical devices, we're still seeing the utilization rates in the
U.S. remain depressed both in admissions and surgical procedures, but we continue to believe that as the economy
recovers and healthcare reform gains momentum, utilization rates will increase.
In terms of prescription rates in the first half of the year, trends have modestly continued upward versus 2013 with the
U.S. Rx volume increasing through May by approximately 1% over the prior year. And global growth in GDP forecast
remain above 3% on stronger momentum in advanced economies such as the U.S. and Europe, while key emerging
economies, including Brazil and India continue to be challenged.
Given the positive demographic trends we're seeing globally and the underlying strength of our businesses, we remain
confident about the long-term growth prospects of the healthcare market. And with our comprehensive and diverse
portfolio of consumer health products, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson has a distinct
competitive advantage in meeting the needs of patients.
When we implemented the strategic framework, a very disciplined and focused approach to evolving our position as the
world's largest and most diverse healthcare company grounded by our credo, we identified four growth drivers, which
by now all of you should be very familiar with: creating value through innovation, global reach/local focus, excellence
in execution and leading with purpose. We're executing against these growth drivers and capitalizing on our scale and
breadth across Johnson & Johnson to ensure that we're effectively positioned to drive and sustain strong global growth

over the long-term.
Now in the near term, we also had clear priorities for the businesses, including achieving our financial targets. As
announced earlier today, we had record sales in the quarter of $19.5 billion, which is a 9.4% operational increase as
compared to the second quarter of 2013. These strong results reflect the continued success of our new product launches
and progress we made in achieving our near-term priorities.
In our Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment, we are leading the industry with the largest, most comprehensive
business in the world and while combining businesses with overlapping products and different business models can be
disruptive, our integration over the past two years of DePuy and Synthes, which we mentioned earlier, has gone well.
Given that we are largely through it, we set a strong foundation for capturing the full growth potential we envisioned at
the onset and we're pleased with the revenue and cost synergies we began to realize. And despite the market pressures,
we remain optimistic about the future in this segment and have seen strong performance in many of our MD&D
businesses. In Hips, we experienced strong operational growth at 5% in the quarter and continue to complement this
growth with new product introductions such as the recently-launched CORAIL Revision Hip system in both the United
States and Europe. We also continue to see solid growth in Trauma at 7% for the quarter, which is built on the strength
of our portfolio and the positive impact of a tender we were awarded in the Middle East as a result of our
comprehensive offerings.
In our global surgery business, we continue to see progress in many areas, including consistent double-digit growth of
our Biosense Webster electrophysiology portfolio. We also have a steady cadence of new product offerings exemplified
by the recent FDA approval of our supplemental PMA with the SEDASYS System, which we anticipate introducing
into the U.S. market in the latter half of 2014 as well as the launch of the HARMONIC ACE +7 Shears with advanced
hemostasis, the first purely ultrasonic device with a 7 millimeter ceiling indication. It's really a great technology.
And as you heard at our MD&D investor meeting in May, our strategy for sustainable long-term growth is driven by
building on the strong market leadership positions we hold on the majority of our key platforms as well as the
contributions we anticipate from our recently-launched products and future pipeline, which includes more than 30
major filings planned by the end of 2016, many on which we've already made good progress since our presentations in
May.
Finally, in line with our emphasis to tighten the focus within our MD&D portfolio, we're creating value through
divestiture opportunities and completed the divestiture of our Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business to The Carlyle
Group, which Dominic will discuss in his remarks. OCD plays a very important role in healthcare, and we're confident
that it's well-positioned to continue serving the interests of patients, customers and employees.
Turning now to our Consumer business, where growth is closely tied with GDP trends, we're pleased with the progress
of the business and executing the strategy we outlined last summer. We have successfully exited a few business
categories recently enabling us to focus on delivering above market growth in our core business and we anticipate
greater opportunities to expand the business in the future as global economies recover and the middle class continues to
grow. Our Consumer brands are important for the equity of Johnson & Johnson and Consumer Healthcare truly is
strategic for us with the potential to serve the 2 billion additional consumers who are predicted to join the growing
middle class and emerging markets.
We've made significant progress in the segment over the last few years and have plans for the coming years to
accelerate the growth of this business through new innovations, brand building and strategic collaborations, working
off a foundation that starts with deep consumer insights. As part of our strategy, we've defined 11 key need states
where with our expertise we can make a difference to consumers and grow our business.
We're also focusing on 12 mega brands including LISTERINE, AVEENO, TYLENOL, and JOHNSON'S Baby to
ensure they are exceeding consumers' expectations around the world. And the strategy is working. We're capturing
share in these and several of the other key categories.

For example, we have seen strong growth in our oral care business outside the U.S. at 7% operationally. Our skin care
and baby businesses are both up 7% operationally in the quarter, and we're also developing innovative collaboration
models with retailers across the globe where we are working to create an unparalleled experience for shoppers in OTC
categories like cold and flu by sharing insights and developing ways to reduce complexity for consumers and drive
visibility for our offerings.
In our U.S. OTC business, we continue making progress in restoring brands to the shelves delivering above market
growth that continue to meet each of our obligations under the consent decree. But we still have work to do. Our goal is
to ensure all of our U.S. OTC products are available every time a consumer is reaching for them. And I'm confident
that we are on a good path to meet that goal.
Turning now to our pharmaceutical business. As the results show, the current business is very strong, driven by new
innovative products that are clearly addressing the unmet medical needs of patients worldwide and the future is bright
with a continued advancement in our pipeline. By any measure, our performance has been outstanding in this segment
and we're leading the industry on numerous fronts, clinical through commercial, and later this morning, you'll hear
more from Paul and Joaquin who I'm pleased to have joining us on the call later today.
You'll recall in the late 2000s, our pharmaceutical business faced significant patent expirations as products worth
roughly $8 billion went off patent. We had to rethink that business model and really focus on areas where we could
make a difference. We needed to streamline our organization and made tough choices to gain efficiencies and reduce
head count in developed markets by nearly 25%. But through our diversified business model, with Consumer and
MD&D continuing to grow during this time, we were able to continue to invest in our Pharma business.
We're also continuing to invest in R&D in our five therapeutic areas and approximately 20% to 21% of sales and we
have put those dollars to work with plans to file more than 10 new drugs and 25 line extensions between 2013 and
2017. Additionally, we are complementing that investment with smaller scale acquisitions and early stage licensing
agreements surfaced through our innovation centers. For Johnson & Johnson, this model has been an excellent source
of value creation.
And I'm delighted that Paul Stoffels and Joaquin Duato are joining the call today to provide an update on their
tremendous work. A little over a year ago, we created the Johnson & Johnson Research and Development Management
Committee led by Paul. This group brings together the senior most R&D leaders across Johnson & Johnson to foster
cross-sector collaboration and deliver transformational new medicines and medical devices. Under Paul's excellent
leadership, our enterprise R&D leaders are harnessing our deep internal expertise and platform capabilities throughout
the organization to develop customer focused solutions that combine our capabilities and expertise across our
portfolios.
And the commercial pharmaceutical strategies, led by Joaquin, are delivering outstanding results in very competitive
global markets where we're continuing to gain share and we're also securing reimbursement in access at accelerated
rates. The teams they put in place have positioned us for continued success for many years to come in our
pharmaceuticals sector.
I'm pleased now to turn the call over to Paul and Joaquin.
Joaquin Duato
Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Paul and I are delighted to speak to you today about our continued
success at our pharmaceutical group. When we look at the pharmaceuticals market, we are very optimistic about the
future with an estimated 4.5% growth anticipated through 2017. While we recognize we'll continue to experience
headwinds, we also see numerous positive drivers, including changing demographics and substantial unmet medical
needs. As a result, there is significant opportunity to improve the lives of patients by bringing transformational medical
innovations to the market.

As Louise mentioned, we are reporting 21.1% operational growth in the second quarter of 2014. This is our 17th
consecutive quarter of growth, including the sixth consecutive quarter in double digits. Without our hepatitis C
products, our growth in the last quarter was 10.5%.
I'm often asked, Joaquin, is this just a lucky run or is there something more to it? After facing significant challenges in
the early 2000s, we made a number of strategic changes to our business including building key development
manufacturing market access and commercial competencies and focusing our innovation to produce a consistent stream
of differentiated new products. These changes are directly responsible for the success we are seeing now, and we
believe position us to continue to succeed in the future. Specifically, we are focused on the five strategic priorities that
you see on these slides. I will speak to you about the first two of these priorities and then hand off to Paul to cover the
remaining three.
When we look at our commercial performance, the first thing to note is that our success is global. We are the fastest
growing top 10 global pharmaceutical company in the U.S., Europe, and Japan by a significant margin. Key to this
success has been both the sales of our core growth products and the sales of new products.
Regarding our core growth products, you can see that REMICADE, VELCADE, and PREZISTA all continue to deliver
strong growth. 2013 REMICADE sales were $6.7 billion, which were 9% higher than 2012. In the second quarter of
this year, sales grew at 8.7%. This is a product that has been on the market since 1998.
VELCADE remains a backbone of multiple myeloma treatment delivering 6.2% growth in the second quarter. Finally,
PREZISTA is the number one HIV protease inhibitor in the U.S. and Europe and we are pleased to note the recent
approval in Canada of PREZCOBIX, our fixed dose combination with Gilead's cobicistat. We have filed for approval
also in the U.S. and in Europe.
We have achieved remarkable success with our new products. As you can see on the left, worldwide sales of new
products launched since 2009 have already generated $5.9 billion of revenue this year and represent nearly 40% of our
second quarter sales. In the United States alone, our cumulative sales of new products launched since 2009 is more than
our next two closest competitors combined.
I would now like to spend a few minutes speaking on the specific products that have driven this performance. ZYTIGA
is the most successful oral oncology launch in history. It is now approved for the treatment of metastatic castrate
resistant prostate cancer in more than 90 countries and the metastatic castration-sensitive registration trial is on track.
As you can see, ZYTIGA continues to hold significant market share in the U.S., gaining 1.2 points versus the first
quarter this year. Worldwide, we generated second quarter sales of $562 million representing more than 40% growth
year-over-year. Nearly 60% of these sales in the quarter were outside the U.S.
As for B-cell malignancies in the last year, we launched our oral oncology drug IMBRUVICA. Developed in
collaboration with Pharmacyclics with a worldwide license agreement for a 50/50 profit split. IMBRUVICA is
launched in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma
in patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Both indications are based on an overall response rate and
improvement and survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established. Moving forward, we're pursuing a
global regulatory strategy for IMBRUVICA in all major markets with European MCL and CLL decisions expected
later this year. IMBRUVICA is being investigated in a number of global clinical trials across potential indications.
In immunology, we are proud to note Janssen was the number one company in total U.S. sales in 2013. This was, of
course, driven by REMICADE, which I mentioned earlier, and by STELARA and SIMPONI. STELARA is the fastest
growing biologic in psoriasis in major markets, including number one new-to-brand share in the U.S. This is in large
part due to STELARA's key psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis approvals and because we are able to demonstrate the
five-year safety and efficacy of STELARA through real world trials and registry data.
For SIMPONI, its ulcerative colitis indication is approved in 43 countries and I'm pleased to note that the IV
formulation for rheumatoid arthritis has launched in the U.S. and in Canada. Both of these products have seen robust
growth this quarter more than 40% and 60%, respectively.

Turning to XARELTO, we have established a highly competitive position in the U.S. with six FDA approved
indications and more than 1.6 million patients treated. XARELTO is the number one novel oral anticoagulant among
U.S. cardiologists. This is in part due to the fact that XARELTO has broad market access with more than 90% coverage
of insured patients and the lowest co-pay of any branded novel anticoagulant. And also because XARELTO offers a
strong customer value proposition with once a day dosing convenience. As a result, we are reporting strong sales of
$361 million in the second quarter, up more than 90% year-over-year. In the last quarter alone, we saw sequential
growth greater than 13%.
Another example of our innovation is INVOKANA, our SGLT2 inhibitor we launched recently in collaboration with
our diabetes care franchise. INVOKANA is a once daily medication offering improved glycemic control, reduction in
body weight, and reduction in systolic blood pressure. These are all extremely important factors in the treatment of type
2 diabetes.
INVOKANA is approved in 45 countries and our fixed-dose combination with metformin, VOKANAMET, is
approved in Europe. We expect the FDA decision for this fixed-dose combination in the third quarter. This year alone
we have had seven major launches of INVOKANA and have received key reimbursement approvals in the U.K.,
Switzerland, and the Netherlands. As you can see, we are number one in new-to-brand share among U.S.
endocrinologists in a very competitive landscape. As Louise mentioned, INVOKANA contributed more than 2.5 points
to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate.
In schizophrenia, we continue to provide medicines and solutions to improve patient care. In the U.S., we're pleased to
note that the FDA granted priority review of INVEGA SUSTENNA One Month for schizoaffective disorder with a
PDUFA date in November. We also recently leveraged a first of its kind real world clinical trial with INVEGA
SUSTENNA to support the filing of an sNDA. It includes data for the label, demonstrating significant delay time to
relapse in schizophrenia compared to oral anti-psychotics. The chart on the right shows the strong launch performance
of INVEGA SUSTENNA outperforming Abilify Maintena, which in the second quarter resulted in sales of $394
million representing a 34.4% growth year-over-year.
The last example I will discuss is our recently launched hepatitis C treatment with brand names OLYSIO, GALEXOS
and SOVRIAD. We continue to see significant market potential in the hepatitis C area and estimate nearly 97% of the
affected population in G7 countries remains untreated. As you are aware, interferon-free treatment options represent a
significant advance for patients. OLYSIO is approved for the use in interferon-free treatment in combination with other
medicinal products in Europe in genotype 1 or 4 patients who are interferon-ineligible or intolerant.
In the U.S., the FDA granted priority review of our sNDA based on the COSMOS trial data for the use of OLYSIO
with sofosbuvir currently marketed as SOVALDI by Gilead with a PDUFA date of November the 6th. In line with the
AASLD and IDSA guidelines, we have seen very strong adoption in the first half of this year with second quarter sales
totally $831 million.
Moving forward, we recognize there will be increased competitive activity with the entrance of new interferon
treatment options beginning later this year, and thus we expect the current run rate is unlikely to continue into 2015.
We are planning studies to evaluate simeprevir with other agents to physicians and patients increased flexibility.
Turning now to emerging markets, our strategy is focused on the strong innovative brand growth through targeted
capability building and novel access models. In particular, we are harnessing local innovation. One example of this is
the opening of our Shanghai Innovation Center expected in October this year. We are also improving local
manufacturing capacity by building factories such as our state-of-the-art-facility in Xi'an, China, and through
technology transfer to local organizations. Finally, we are pioneering new business models through public private
partnerships and leveraging the strength of our Johnson & Johnson organization to improve access to our medicines.
As you can see, we have had remarkable global success. This success is the direct result of the strategic choices and
changes that we made to our business years ago. Going forward, we are focused on two critical success factors to
maintain our momentum. First, we will continue to leverage our world-class capabilities in clinical development,
regulatory manufacturing, market access, and commercial to promote the ongoing success of our new products. In total,

six of these products have each sold more than $1 billion in the last four quarters and two more are on track to reach
this threshold.
As you saw on the previous slides, several have robust growth rates of 40%, 60% and even 90%. Second, we are deeply
committed to sustaining long-term growth and Paul will now tell you more about how our total emphasis on innovation
has built a strong pipeline of transformational products that we believe will catalyze the next wave of growth for our
business.
Paul?
Paulus Stoffels
Thank you, Joaquin, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure today to discuss with you our pharmaceutical R&D
strategy, which is focused on delivering transformational medical innovation and created a cycle of success that
positions us for continued growth in the future. Our vision and our R&D strategy has not changed. As a leading
healthcare company, we believe that by focusing on transformational innovation, medical needs and differentiation, we
can make a significant difference in the world and build a sustainable growing business.
We have some of the world's leading scientific and medical experts who bring deep insights to select and prioritize the
best science, internal or external, to tackle those diseases. We have established unparalleled global development
capabilities and have set industry benchmark for timelines for filing submissions and productivity and also for speed to
market. We launched 14 new products in the past five years in major markets around the world, including three new
molecular entities, or NMEs, that we launched since our Pharmaceuticals update in May last year: OLYSIO,
IMBRUVICA and SYLVANT.
Our strategy is delivering. In our last update at the Pharmaceutical analyst day last May, we told you that we
anticipated filing more than 10 potential NMEs and more than 25 significant line extensions between 2013 and 2017.
We are on track to deliver. Since last May, in addition to launching three new products, we have received 20 additional
approvals for line extensions in major markets.
The significant line extensions approved are SIMPONI for ulcerative colitis, SIMPONI ARIA for rheumatoid arthritis
in the U.S., IMBRUVICA for previously treated CLL, VELCADE for multiple myeloma retreatment combination
therapy and transplant, OLYSIO for treatment experienced patients, STELARA for psoriatic arthritis, and
VOKANAMET fixed dose combination with metformin immediately released formulation for type 2 diabetes in
Europe.
Our winning formula has been consistent. First, we believe in focus. We focus on a few key disease areas where we can
really make a difference and we prioritize our investments in those areas. The disease area focus has allowed us to
attract the world's leading scientists and medical experts and built a great depth of expertise in those areas. Second, our
experts select and source the best science and technology through our own internal research or by accessing the best
science externally through partnerships, collaborations, licensing and acquisitions.
Third, we leverage the breadth and scale of our global development organization. Our global capabilities have allowed
us to simultaneously develop, file and launch drugs across the globe with industry leading efficiency, quality and
success rates. And finally one of our key success factors has been our ability to accelerate cycle times and achieve
industry leading timelines for regulatory submissions. I will focus on each of these success factors next.
Our focus on innovation is a critical aspect of the strategy. We focus our research in five therapeutic areas and within
those areas, we focus on specific disease areas where there's a high unmet need, where there is transformational science
that we can leverage, and where we have deep expertise and capabilities that we can bring to bear. Today, we are
focused on 18 disease areas and in each of these areas, we have leading expertise and know-how to select the best
science, thereby increasing the probability of success.

We have also entered into the exciting area of immuno-oncology where there is promising new science and have
established several collaborations. This slide shows our entire end-to-end strategy on one page, both our rigorous
approach to sourcing innovation, to global development and the key characteristics of our strategy that sets us apart. In
addition to the deep internal expertise within our therapeutic areas, we have strong research capabilities in biomarkers
and world class capabilities in our centers of excellence in small molecules, biotechnology, vaccines and diagnostics.
We complement this with external innovation. We access early innovation through our J&J Innovation Centers in
London, Boston, San Francisco and Shanghai. Today, we have over 100 projects in discovery and about 50 NMEs in
early development. In addition, we have more than 300 collaborations externally and over 50 companies located in our
incubators. To access innovation in the early development stage, we leverage venture capital to invest in exciting
growth opportunities, explore new areas and accelerate assets.
In late stage, we accessed innovation via traditional licensing, partnerships and acquisition, example of which include
our recent deals with Genmab on multiple myeloma with Aragon on prostate cancer with ViiV Healthcare on HIV and
with Vertex on influenza A. As I mentioned, we have world class global development capabilities. We have built
strong medical and scientific teams with disease area, clinical, and regulatory expertise.
We are increasing the value of our R&D portfolio by optimizing output, time, cost, and quality. Our 24/7 development
operation, speed-to-market and global execution make us a partner of choice in the industry. These capabilities, along
with our market access and launch excellence, represent some of our key strengths and differentiators. They have
enabled us to simultaneously file and launch our products globally, generate compelling value evidence, and deliver
successful launches of our products in multiple markets. And the flexibility and commercialization models with
partners and their ability to collaborate and leverage our strength and capabilities enable us to achieve industry leading
success and growth. A deep understanding of the innovation landscape is key to our ability to source innovation.
Our experts define an innovation strategy, conduct a holistic scan of the innovation landscape, and prioritize all
accessible opportunities, internal or external, to select the best assets. Here you see a bull's eye chart of the innovation
landscape for piece B-cell malignancy. The inner circles represent later stage products and the outer circles the early
stage pre-clinical products. We take this rigorous approach to evaluating and sourcing innovation in each of the disease
areas. Our development organization continues to deliver. We have a flexible R&D operations engine, which can pivot
from execution of mega-trials to execution of trials for rare diseases, and today supporting about 75,000 patients across
400 clinical studies annually.
These capabilities have accelerated our speed to market. They have enabled the successful execution of multiple
comprehensive and large clinical programs, which are outcomes-based and use adaptive study designs. We have around
the world, around the clock capabilities in all aspects of the clinical development and the critical [ph] part (44:31)
culture that enables speed while maintaining quality.
The fourth critical success factor has been our ability to accelerate cycle time. Because of our focus on medical need
and differentiation, of the last 10 new NMEs we launched, five received priority review status. In addition, we received
breakthrough designation for five indications with three of our products. Today, our average cycle time from database
to submission is about two months better than industry median, making us the leader in time to submission.
These capabilities have enabled us to have industry-leading NME success rate with fastest cycle times. Compared to
our competitors, we have a higher development success rate resulting in more NME approvals per year. Looking to the
future, we have an exciting pipeline. On the left you see the three NME approvals since May 2013, and the number of
significant line extensions approved since last May. In the middle, you can see some of our key NMEs, which are under
clinical investigation as potential treatments for key unmet needs in a variety of areas.
Daratumumab, the first anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, a compound
with breakthrough status, which we licensed from Genmab. ARN 509, an androgen receptor inhibitor for pre-metastatic
prostate cancer, which came to us from the acquisition of Aragon.
FGFR kinase inhibitor for solid tumors discovered in the collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals. Sirukumab, the
first anti-IL-6 therapy for patients with RA and other autoimmune diseases; Guselkumab, the first anti-IL-23 antibody

for psoriasis and potentially autoimmune diseases; Fulranumab, an anti-NGF antibody for osteoarthritic pain licensed
from Amgen; and Esketamine, the first NMDA antagonist for patients with treatment resistant depression also with
breakthrough designation. And VX-787, a first-in-class Influenza A specific oral polymerase inhibitor, a compound we
recently licensed from Vertex.
We also have a number of key line extensions in development, including for key products such as XARELTO and
INVOKANA. We have Paliperidone Palmitate three-month formulation, the first three-month long-acting injectable
treatment for patients with schizophrenia; and ibrutinib, the first BTK inhibitor oncology drug for the treatment of
several B-cell malignancies.
Our people are driven by a sense of purpose to care for the world. At times, we develop a product just because it is the
right thing to do. We have the privilege to serve in healthcare and we also have a responsibility. One example of this is
SIRTURO, the first therapy with novel mechanism of action against TB approved by the FDA in more than 40 years.
SIRTURO is now approved in U.S., Europe, Russia and Korea and the file is under review in seven other countries. We
have established multiple product development partnerships and through our agreement with the Global Drug Facility,
we are making SIRTURO available to critically ill patients in 130 countries.
We also established a collaboration with the International Partnership for Microbicides for the development of
TMC120 for prevention of transmission of HIV, which is now in large-scale clinical testing. We are providing access to
our products by not enforcing patents on PREZISTA in Sub-Saharan Africa and least developed countries, and by
licensing our HIV products to generic producers. And finally, to our vaccine unit, we also make critical vaccines
available to children around the world and we are developing new vaccines for polio and HIV.
In summary, we are in an extraordinary cycle of success. We have world-class commercial capabilities driving our
growth; our accelerated emerging market performance is sustaining our momentum; a focus on innovation, medical
need and differentiation sets us up to deliver future growth. We have a leading R&D pipeline with differentiated
therapies addressing major unmet needs in significant markets. Our innovation is delivering growth and our growth is
sustaining our ability to invest in innovation. We believe our business is well positioned to succeed for the long term.
Thank you.
And now let me turn it back to Alex.
Alex Gorsky
Thank you, Paul and Joaquin. I hope you can see why we're all so proud of the Pharmaceutical segment, and very
optimistic about our future growth in this area.
So I'd now like to turn it over to Dominic Caruso for a more detailed review of our financial performance.
Dominic J. Caruso
Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As you've heard on the call, we are very pleased with our progress and
strong results thus far in 2014, and we are well positioned for continued growth in this dynamic healthcare
environment. I'll take the next few minutes to review our financial performance in the second quarter as well as the
recently-completed OCD divestiture. I will then provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the
balance of the year.
Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2014.
Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude
special items. We are pleased to report adjusted net earnings of $4.8 billion in the quarter, which was up 11.3% over
the second quarter of 2013, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 versus $1.48 a year ago, up 12.2%, which
exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call.

These results were driven by strong operational sales growth of 9%, primarily from our recently launched
pharmaceutical products, including hepatitis C treatment OLYSIO, or SOVRIAD, which is the brand name in Japan.
The net impact of our hepatitis C products including OLYSIO, SOVRIAD and INCIVO, contributed approximately 4%
to the worldwide operational sales growth. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2014 second quarter
net earnings were adjusted to exclude certain charges for the following special items: costs associated with the
continued integration of Synthes and additional reserves for litigation expenses.
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. I am pleased to point out that
we saw a very good operating performance this quarter. Overall, our pre-tax operating margin increased 230 basis
points, and a major driver of that increase came from sales of OLYSIO. Cost of goods sold was 30 basis points higher
than the same period last year, primarily due to pricing dynamics and the impact of the devaluation of the Japanese yen,
partly offset by positive mix of the business. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 200 basis points
lower as compared to the second quarter of 2013, due to the growth of new products in our Pharmaceutical business
and overall good management of cost, primarily in our MD&D business.
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was down compared to the prior year, primarily due
to timing of various R&D programs, as we expect to continue to make important investments for the future. Interest
expense net of interest income of approximately $100 million was slightly higher than prior year. Other expenses net of
other income was $226 million in the quarter compared to $172 million in the same period last year.
Now excluding the special items that were included in this line item, other expenses net of other income was actually a
net gain of $194 million compared to a net gain of $394 million as the prior year reflected the gain we recognized on
the sale of our shares in Elan Corporation. This year, the net gain reflects the divestiture of our K-Y brand partly offset
by some asset write-downs. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 21.1% compared to 20% in the same
period last year, due primarily to geographic mix of the results in each period.
Early in the third quarter, we completed the divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics to The Carlyle Group for
approximately $4 billion, subject to customary adjustments. On an after-tax basis, we will record a net gain of
approximately $1 billion, which we will treat as a special item in the third quarter results. Since we will no longer
recognize sales or earnings from this business going forward, we plan to buy back shares with the cash proceeds to
mitigate the EPS impact on future earnings.
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2014. Before I discuss sales and
earnings, I will first give some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast, beginning with cash and
interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $14.5 billion of net cash, which consists
of approximately $31.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $17.1 billion of debt. For purposes
of your models, assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I'd suggest you consider modeling net
interest expense between $400 million and $500 million, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as
gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, as well as
divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We'd be comfortable with your models for 2014 reflecting other income and
expense, excluding special items, as a net gain, ranging from approximately $450 million to $550 million, which is
lower than our previous guidance.
And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2014 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress,
although that has not yet occurred. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2014,
excluding special items, of approximately 19% to 20%. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it will negatively impact
the tax rate by approximately 0.5%. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon
this rate throughout the year.
Now turning to guidance on sales and earnings, as we have done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a
constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe
this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of

our sales and EPS results for 2014 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those
results.
Our sales and earnings guidance for 2014 takes into account several assumptions that I highlighted to you in April. For
sales, our assumptions remain consistent from earlier guidance that PROCRIT will not have biosimilar competition in
2014. And for INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we do not anticipate generic entries for these
products this year. Further, our guidance now reflects the divestiture of OCD and the net incremental sales of our
hepatitis C products.
Considering the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase
on a constant currency basis of between 4.5% and 5.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2014 again, on a
constant currency basis, of approximately $74.5 billion to $75.3 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance,
reflecting the net impact of the adjustment for the divestiture of OCD and incremental hepatitis C product sales.
Our underlying operational growth in 2014 guidance, excluding the hepatitis C products and OCD for the full year, is
approximately 4%. As you know, we're anticipating that OLYSIO will face significant competition from new hepatitis
C products later in the year, the full impact of which is difficult for us to predict at this point. And while we are not
providing guidance for 2015, this will certainly pose a headwind next year.
We're also not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales if
currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year, that our sales
growth rate would decrease by nearly half of 1%. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to
range between 4% and 5% for a total expected level of reported sales between approximately $74.1 billion to $74.9
billion, which is lower than our previous guidance, again now adjusted for OCD and hepatitis C products as noted
earlier.
Moving on to earnings, there are factors to note about foreign currency fluctuations that impact real economic
transactions as opposed to only translation. As we've discussed in the past, the devaluation of the Japanese yen versus
the U.S. dollar is expected to have a negative impact on 2014 gross margins of approximately 60 basis points, or a
negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.11. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact of an official
devaluation of the Venezuelan bolívar or any other currency.
Our 2014 guidance reflects the strong performance we saw in the second quarter, the second half impact of the
divestiture of OCD, a lower level of net gains at other income and expenses, and our plan to continue investing in
future growth. Given those factors, we suggest that you consider full-year 2014 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of
special items, of between $5.80 or $5.87 per share on an operational or constant currency basis.
And again, while we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact
on EPS if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year, then our
reported EPS, excluding special items, would be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share due to exchange
rate fluctuations.
We therefore suggest that you model our reported EPS, excluding special items, in a range between $5.85 and $5.92
per share, or a growth rate of 6% to 7%. This is higher than our previous guidance. And as a reminder, our earnings
include intangible amortization of $1.4 billion on a before-tax basis or an impact of approximately $0.38 on EPS.
As you update your models for guidance I just provided, you will see that we do expect that our pre-tax operating
margins will show a stronger improvement in 2014 over 2013 levels than we previously expected. This is due to the
strong performance of our business primarily driven by new product launches including the significant benefit from
OLYSIO this year.
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong results through the midpoint. Our strong performance in the second
quarter has allowed us to offset the negative earnings impact that will occur in the second half of this year from the
recently completed divestiture of the OCD business. Although we expect to see lower other income expense gains and
along with our intent to invest in future growth, we are very comfortable with an overall increase in our earnings

And now, I'd like to turn things back over to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise?
Louise Mehrotra
Thank you, Dominic. Jennifer, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Good morning. Quickly for Alex and then also for Joaquin or Paul. Alex, I'm going to [ph] stay
away (01:01:12) from M&A for you. But for big picture, I just wanted kind of your view on GDP growth in developed
markets. It sounds like in med tech we're seeing a bit of a disconnect maybe in consumer as well, and there's a growing
view GDP will be improving. What's your view in the near term and long term that the correlation may improve or get
better as you look at your forecast?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Yes. Matt, this is Alex. Thanks a lot for the question. As you know, trying to predict these things
out into the future is always a bit of a challenge. But as we're experiencing right now and as we discussed earlier in the
discussion, we're seeing hospital utilization rates specifically admissions, surgical procedures, lab procedures, and even
primary care physician visits. They remain somewhat subdued, and we've seen this trend for several quarters.
Now, long term of course, we see the offset to that in demographics, increasing middle class, increasing access to care
under the Affordable Care Act as drivers for us. So we remain optimistic because we don't think there's a fundamental
reason for the underlying demand or disease rates to change. But that's something that we're certainly watching.
If we look across to Europe, we continue to see some challenge in areas but overall, we would say that the impact in
Europe has moderated somewhat. And we continue to see good solid growth in the developing markets. I mean, overall
we had about 10% growth on an annual basis so far in BRIC, and we'll expect that to continue into the future as well.
So, I mean, I think that's the way we're thinking about it right now. But it's certainly something that we're going to
continue to watch closely.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Thanks, Alex. And a quick one for Paul or Joaquin. You gave us a lot of data on the form of the
pipeline in the near term. Can you just say broadly on the R&D, because you're still spending a lot of money as a
percent of sales even though the overall pharma growth has accelerated, can you say of the five therapeutic areas, is
oncology and immunology getting the lion's share of that in the current run rate?
<A - Paulus Stoffels>: Yes, absolutely. Especially oncology is getting the lion's share of that. We have several new
direct oncology therapeutics, Daratumumab, ARN-509, ibrutinib with all of the line extensions, so as well as now
immuno-oncology where we have several collaborations and a lot of internal research ongoing as well as efforts in
biomarkers and establishing diagnostic biomarkers approach to get to a much better patient outcome. So that is
definitely the largest as well as immunology, where we still continue to focus on several new products, Guselkumab.
And we have also there a new number of new auto-therapies in development, so those two will continue to be the focus
of the organization with significant resources.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Thanks, Paul.

Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Hi. Dominic, I just want to start with the quarter and with the guidance revision. I think
one of the questions people have is why didn't J&J raise guidance by more [indiscernible] (01:04:50) at this point, so
wanted to maybe just spend a minute on that with you. The quarter itself was $0.11 above The Street consensus. You
raised by $0.05 cents on the low, $0.02 on the high end yet you're absorbing $0.05 of dilution from OCD. It looks like
you took down the other income being assumed for the year by $0.04. Anything else that I'm missing there and maybe
just want to comment on the decision to raise guidance on what you did?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah. Sure, Mike. Thanks. Just a couple points, I mean we did of course exceed Street
estimates for the quarter by $0.11. As you know, we don't provide quarterly guidance. We provide annual guidance,
and when we spoke to the investment community last quarter we were confident that our strong operating results would
help absorb the OCD dilution in the back half of the year within the range we have previously provided. So let me just
walk down the items that you mentioned.
We did exceed analyst estimates by about $0.11 cents. Almost half of that will be used, of course, to offset the OCD,
lower earnings in the back half of the year. As you pointed out, other income and expense gains will be lower than we
expected this year. That's another $0.03 or $0.04. Currency was a minor adjustment.
If you look at our overall guidance, we therefore, after absorbing this $0.11 that we just described, we do think that
overall guidance is up about $0.04. If you think about the midpoint of our guidance, last time it was about $5.85. The
midpoint now is about $5.89. So we feel good that despite this reconciliation that you just walked through, the business
will continue to perform well, and therefore we are comfortable raising the guidance for the balance of the year.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Let me ask one product question, if I can, and it was during the quarter there was a
new patent issue for ZYTIGA that I was hoping you could just comment on your current expectations or generic
competition for ZYTIGA. I think The Street historically assumed that will come in late 2016? Can you update us on
your thoughts on that topic?
<A - Joaquin Duato>: Thank you. This is Joaquin. You are correct. Our expectation is that ZYTIGA patent will go
until December 2016. That is the composition of matter with the five-year data exclusivity under Hatch-Waxman
extension.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: And, Joaquin, the notice of allowance from the three, four patent, does that change that
thinking at all in terms of timing?
<A - Joaquin Duato>: Not at this point. We are now working understanding what the impact of this notice of
allowance is. It's a method of patent use. So at this point we remain with our position that I described before.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Well, thanks, Joaquin. I'll let others jump in.

Your next question comes from Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Thanks for the question. Just first just starting with the quarter, Dominic, I was wondering if you
could call out or help us think through a little bit about the margin contribution of OLYSIO and the impact of the
Japanese yen so we can get a better sense for what the underlying operating margins of the business might be moving
forward excluding those items.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah, sure, Derrick. Well, overall, including the negative impact of the Japanese yen to
gross margins, which we said was about 60 basis points for the year, obviously we saw most of that in the second
quarter. The overall pre-tax operating margin improved to about 230 basis points despite that headwind and I'd say

about two-thirds of that improvement is attributable to OLYSIO. That's how I would frame it.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay. And that's something that when we think about next year moving forward, how much of
that should we think about sort of perhaps not being sustainable?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Well, as I mentioned earlier, Derrick, it's a little too early to predict. I mean, we know that
new competition's coming and – but at this point it's premature to speculate on it. Obviously, when we speak to you in
January about our guidance for 2015 we'll make that much clearer then.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay. Thanks. And then specific to pharma product question, I was wondering if you could
comment on the impact of biosimilar competition to REMICADE? So next year in the European markets – the major
European markets should start seeing some biosimilar competition. What are your expectations there? Maybe you
could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the few markets where you're already seeing that biosimilar entrant?
And then in the U.S., one of the competitors has talked about filing for a biosimilar REMICADE before the end of this
year with potential FDA approval for next year. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about how secure you
feel about your IP position in the U.S. for REMICADE.
<A>: Thanks for the question. The biosimilars area is something that we watch very closely. As you know, biosimilars
are not identical to the originator medicines and therefore, the [ph] consistency (01:10:17) in which they will be
prescribed will be different and the situation we have in is more molecules. At the same time, developing,
manufacturing and commercializing biosimilars has different costs. I mean, they need to prepare full clinical dose here.
The manufacturing biologics is an expensive and complex process, and commercializing then we'll also have additional
costs. So we expect biosimilars to behave as lower cost brands. And from that perspective, biosimilars wouldn't have
the type of impact in [indiscernible] (01:10:51) that you see with generic small molecules.
A good example of that is what happened with erythropoietin alfa in Europe. We lost the patent years ago and we
remain the leading erythropoietin alfa product in Europe despite of the biosimilars that have been launched.
Now, what is our patent landscape today? You refer to the U.S., in our two key markets in the U.S. our patent would
expire in September 2018, and in our key European markets that represent 80% of our European sales in February
2015. Our strategy regarding biosimilars remain the same. We are going to clearly work with the regulatory authorities
to ensure patient safety in this area. As far as the conditions in which these products have to be developed, have to be
prescribed, that includes naming, which we think is important, that includes to what extent indications should not be
extrapolated and that includes also obviously interchangeabilities. So that's the first point that we are working globally
in order to ensure our patient safety.
The second point is that we have an extensive safety reliable evidence database with regards to REMICADE. It's been
used already prescribing 2 million patients. It was launched in 1998 and we believe that is a factor that physicians will
consider when they prescribe. And the third one is that we continue to invest in immunology as Paul described. We
think there's still unmet medical needs there and that we are going to work in different mechanism of action such as
anti-IL6 or anti-IL23 in order to try to address these unmet medical needs. So that's our strategy.
Now, impact so far of biosimilars in the countries that have been launched like Korea or some European countries in
which we are not patent protected. The impact has been very, very limited, and the price erosion has also been limited.
The discount in which these products have been launched average about 25% to the branded price. So that's the
situation today as far as the biosimilars to REMICADE. With regard to your question of the U.S. and the patent of
REMICADE in the U.S., we feel very strong about the strength of our patents and we continue to confirm that our
patent as we see today will expire in September 2018.

<Q - Derrick Sung>: Right. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two for Alex. So, Alex, this is one of
the best quarters you've posted in many, many years, I think. You know, I got 10% organic growth and 12% EPS is this
sustainable long-term. So what are your financial goals for JNJ long-term and how should investors think about kind of
what's realistic for JNJ over the next few years? And I did have one follow-up for you, Alex.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure, Larry. Thanks a lot for the question. As we articulated back in January, we see that longer
term the overall healthcare market growing somewhere in the rate of 3% to 5%. And we definitely try to manage for the
long-term. And so while quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, we may see some fluctuations, we think, generally speaking,
as we put in all the ups and downs going forward, that's probably a pretty reasonable estimate and consistent with what
a lot of surveys would show.
Our goal is that we want to always exceed the market growth, i.e. we want to be bringing new innovations to market,
we want to be competitive in the way we gain share, so we always aspire and shoot to exceed what the market growth
is. And we said in terms of our overall profitability and bottom line performance that a company of our size and of our
scale should consistency strive to grow our bottom line at or slightly faster than our top.
So that's really our long-term strategy, but as you acknowledged at the beginning of the question, we're very proud of
the performance that we're posting as of now and certainly it's led by our pharmaceutical group that really by any
measure has done exceedingly well starting by bringing a lot of great new therapies that are helping patients but also
driving our business. But I also think if you look across the balance of our business, our consumer as we noted, while
up 3.5 operationally, if we netted out for divestitures growing at almost 6%, and if you look at the strength of some of
the underlying brands, skin care, baby care, North America OTCs, all very solid, high single digits, taking share across
the board so we're really pleased with that.
And even in our MD&D, clearly we have a few areas that have been challenged such as the pricing and the diabetes
market, the OCD divestiture and some investments we're making in other areas. We think if we net out for divestitures
and some of those extremes, we're probably up at about 2% with clearly a path to grow faster going forward. So that's
the way we see it overall, Larry.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: That's very helpful, and that's a good segue into my follow-up. So you talked about
consolidation, the need for consolidation in the medtech industry further in your remarks. So can you talk about the
implications of the Medtronic-Covidien merger for the industry in JNJ? And how do you see J&J's MD&D business
evolving over the next few years? Thanks.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure. Thank you. Larry, if you think back to about three years ago when we announced the
Synthes acquisition, I mean two and half, three years ago, part of the strategic rationale that we made at that time was
that we definitely saw consolidation in the future simply because of the number of different participants you had in the
market, the pressures that we expected going forward. And as a result of that, we believe proactively sought out and
conducted the Synthes acquisition, which we're pleased with the way that it's going, and we have achieved our sales as
well as our margin goals that we have set for ourselves along the way. And in fact, I think, after the last couple of years
of going through disruption which you would anticipate in a merger of that size, I think now we're really poised for
solid growth going forward. And so what I would say is at that time we had predicted that that in fact would happen.
I think the other aspect was we looked at areas like our cardiovascular business and drug-eluting stents and we saw
market pressure ahead both in terms of volume and pricing. We therefore made a difficult decision to exit that market.
But nonetheless, we think that that was the right decision to make based upon the overall dynamics.
So if we look at ourselves today, we think we're clearly the broadest medical device company. We think we're
well-positioned particularly when you consider areas like general surgery, like orthopedics, we have not only broad by
also deep offerings that give us solid market position across a number of different product platforms. We realize that in
cardiovascular we're sub-scale. We have a very strong EP business that's growing at 14%. We also have some other

segments, we don't think is a bad place to be and certainly we'll continue to evaluate our options going forward.

Your next question comes from Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions.
<A>: Hey. Good morning.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Good morning. One for you, Alex, just on your conversation around emerging markets. I
appreciate all the additional color and the update. I was curious, given the traditional strategies for penetrating these
markets, and I'd say over the last several years, you're still evolving, whether it's, promotion and penetration with
diagnostics or commercializing prior generation or lower cost therapeutics that might fit better into these markets. The
local innovation approach or what seems like almost a customization approach as you look at some of these emerging
middle markets, I'd love to understand a little bit more about how that is going and maybe when we'll start to see some
of the fruit of those efforts. And I have one follow-up.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure. No, Mike, as you know, I think there have been several phases to growth in emerging
markets, and I think historically we have taken a lot of our technology from the developed markets, and we have
basically appealed to the higher segments in the emerging markets, and obviously tried to adapt those products based
upon the commercial model, the distribution system that exists in that particular area. But more and more we realized
that our approaches and sometimes actually the unmet medical need is different, and so developing the underlying
capability or product acquisition, development, and commercialization unique to that entity is something that we're
focusing on.
So that's a major driver behind our innovation center that we focused in Shanghai. We do have R&D centers in both
Shanghai and Beijing. I think we're still the earlier phases of some of the projects that we have coming out of those, but
clearly it's our goal to develop a much more customized approach for those particular markets. That being said, we still
think that there's good opportunity in some of the premium segments across all three of our sectors. So we'll continue to
work those very hard as well.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Great. And then I realize it may be a little off script here, but either it's Louise or Dominic, I'd
love to understand one of the comments you mentioned on your orthopedic market and your Knee business. Pricing
pressure I think you mentioned and market softness. Given that you had introduced the rotating platform version of
ATTUNE this spring and it seemed like that's a business that ought to be firing on at least most cylinders, can you give
us any more color as to why it came up flat and what we can expect going forward?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Yeah, Matt. This is Alex again. Let me take a shot at that first and then Louise can certainly add
any color as necessary. But as you know, we're one of the first companies to report in this space, so it's always a
challenge to predict exactly how everyone is going to come in. But as we look at our business, we think that we're
maintaining share or slightly growing. What we've seen is somewhat of a more cyclical trend towards particularly knee
procedures we think shifting more to the back end of the year.
Now if you think about last year and the very robust growth that we saw in Q4, about some of the ways now the
patients have a greater responsibility of providing their co-payments up front with the procedures, but that does result
in more of a second half of the year effect than early in the year. Again, let me put the caveat in that we can't say that
with certainty because we're coming out early on the reporting. We're going to watch it closely. But from what we're
hearing from our people in the field, we don't think that there are significant share shifts taking place.

We continue to get really good feedback on ATTUNE as it continues to be rolled out. And as you can see from the

Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Just first for Dominic, you
commented two-thirds of the 230 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter was contributed by OLYSIO leaving
us about 75 basis points to 80 basis points from the rest of the business. But can you just comment on relative
contributions from the Pharma Medical Device unit and Consumers units? Was each a contributor? And then how
should we think about operating margins for the device unit excluding Ortho-Clinical? How much improvement can we
expect post-divestiture going forward?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah, sure, Josh. Well, obviously, the Pharmaceutical business that drove most of our
growth this quarter is our best performing business in margin. So, obviously, they're a major contributor. The other two
businesses also contributed. I mentioned the lower cost in the MD&D business in particular.
I think, going forward, it's difficult to predict for each business because as we develop our plans we will balance off
investment opportunities for each business with appropriate – whether the R&D programs or product launches, et
cetera. So I can't give you a specific as to what to expect from each of the business going forward, but for MD&D, the
margins ex-OCD should definitely improve because that was a business that had margins lower than our overall
MD&D business.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Great. Thanks. And, Louise, sorry if I missed this, but did you call out the growth of the
Spine unit? And can you download us on price and mix for Spine in the quarter?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. So the Spine unit in the U.S., this is in operational growth. In the U.S. it's down 2%.
O-U.S. is up 4% for a worldwide growth of 1% for the total. And in terms of pricing in Spine, Spine in terms of price in
the U.S. only, I don't have it for worldwide, the U.S. is down 5% in price with a positive mix of about 1.4% for a net
for about 3.5% down. Okay? Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Good morning, everybody.

<Q - Rick A. Wise>: How are you? Portfolio optimization, you obviously have made a lot of moves here with
acquisitions over the last – since you took over acquisitions and divestitures. And I assume you're going to continue to
optimize and refine the portfolio, but is there a lot more to come? Are you done for the near-term? How should we be
thinking about it?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey, Rick. Thanks a lot for the question. Rick, we're going to continue to stay very active
particularly where we see great areas of unmet medical need where we think we can contribute and really bring value to
the marketplace. I think there are opportunities across all of our segments. We've been very active, as Paul noted

earlier, in some of the partnerships and development programs that we've been able to bring together in our
Pharmaceutical Group. And we think that there our agnostic approach of internal versus external sourcing has actually
really helped, been a driver. At the end of the day, we want the best science and I think clearly we're seeing the results
of that approach with the success that we're experiencing. But we're certainly not slowing down. We continue to be
very active particularly in the five therapeutic areas where we're targeting.
I think if you look across MD&D, there too we continue to see opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, given our decision
several years ago in cardiovascular, we're going to continue to watch that area very closely to augment potentially on to
our EP business, which has done very well. And we continue to look for other ways in orthopedics as well as in global
surgery. Again, where we see great technologies it's either a complementary fit, has platform potential, or may give us
an opportunity for vertical integration.
And in our Consumer segment, another area that we're very committed to, here too we see opportunities. We think that
we've done a very nice job over the past several years of focusing on really what are the key growth opportunities that
we have in that segment, and as a result, we've done several smaller divestitures. We think that's allowed us to be more
focused, more effective, more efficient. But here too we certainly see opportunities to gain additional scale across
different areas of that portfolio. So we'll remain active, but I think in a strategic level, that's the way that we're currently
thinking about it.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Thank you for that. Just a follow-up question on diabetes. Diabetes particularly in U.S. remains
challenged, but it was a little less challenged this quarter than I expected. And are we close to a turning point? When do
you think that we get back to even if you will on that? And maybe can you follow up with a little discussion about the
Vibe rollout? When will we see the full o-U.S. launch and where are you in the U.S. with filings and launch? Thank
you very much.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Yeah. A couple of things. One is we remain committed to the diabetes space. And I think, as you
know, the significant – I think it was a 72% price reduction took place in the United States occurred in the first half of
the year. So we do expect to be lapping that. If we look at the underlying dynamics of the market, I'd like to commend
our team, because we continue to see very good performance in SMBG both in the U.S. as well as outside.
Also with our insulin pump business, Animas, we've seen improving performance. We do have a Verio under review
by the FDA. I don't believe we're projecting an approval time at this point, but we certainly think that that's going to
offer a nice addition for patients as well as for physicians.
And the other important dynamic, Rick, is that our diabetes business has also been involved in the launch of
INVOKANA and when you consider the strong relationships that we've had for a number of years with the
endocrinologists, part of our early success with INVOKANA has been because of the way we've been able to bring a
broader, more comprehensive offering to those specialists, and frankly that's better for patients, that's better for the
physicians, and better for our business.

2015. That's my first question.
And then second, SG&A came in as a ratio way better than our expectations. We were thinking SG&A ratio
somewhere in the 29% to 30% and in the quarter it came in at 28%. I don't think that's a realistic run rate, so maybe
help us think about SG&A spend for the rest of the year. Thanks.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Yeah, Glenn, let me comment a little bit on OLYSIO then ask Joaquin to comment as well.
Obviously you saw an uptick in OLYSIO sales in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. They were at $800
million in the second quarter. And we noted that we expect competition coming soon at the latter part of the year. So
obviously, for the second half of the year, we will have competition for OLYSIO that we did not have in the first two
quarters. So in terms of modeling, we do expect that the current run rate is not really a sustainable run rate going
forward. Joaquin, anything else to add to that?
<A - Joaquin Duato>: No. Reiterate what you mentioned with the competition coming in, interferon-free regimens
coming into the market in the later part of this year. So it's unlikely that the current run rate is going to continue. That
said, we see OLYSIO a very relevant player in hepatitis C moving forward, too, and we continue to invest in different
clinical trials and clinical data to prove additional flexibility for patients and physicians. Paul described before the style
that we are doing in Phase III with 12 weeks and 8 weeks in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients in combination with
sofosbuvir and we plan to continue to do different studies with different treatment regimens to add additional
flexibility. Paul?
<A - Paulus Stoffels>: Well, the focus on shortening therapy as well as increasing queue rates for patients by using
multiple different combinations and we are investing significantly in next stage studies.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: I think on one – just to follow up on your question about SG&A, we don't give line-specific
guidance but it is true that this particular quarter, we saw a 200 basis point improvement in SG&A compared to last
year and most of the 230 basis point improvement in pre-tax operating margin was a result of that. And I mentioned
earlier that that was also two-thirds driven by OLYSIO. So I think this quarter's a relatively low SG&A quarter
relatively speaking, but it is an area that we constantly strive to keep an eye on because quite frankly, we'd rather invest
more in R&D. So if we can spend more on R&D and get more productive R&D investment, we would look to offset
that with some lower SG&A spend going forward.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thank you. Next question, please.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks for taking my question. I have some pharma directed questions, taking advantage of
Paul and Joaquin's presence. I know you guys talk about your commercial execution and I know you spend a lot of
money modeling complex markets like the prostate market. Could you just comment briefly with regards to any
particular hurdles you anticipate with Aragon 509 as it may be difficult to show mortality benefit in a short trial? And
secondly, how big could that market be if the combined prostate market when you are able to penetrate in the prostate –
the pre-metastatic but high risk pick category? That's my first question. Thanks.
<A - Joaquin Duato>: So let me start with the size of the market and maybe a good example is how ZYTIGA is doing
today. About 60% of the ZYTIGA sales today are already in the pre-chemotherapy setting. Now, how big the
non-metastatic setting is going to be because, as you know, we start the trial with ARN-509 in patients with have rising
PSAs are not yet metastatic is going to be bigger and most likely will have a longer duration of treatment. It's difficult
for me to give you an exact dimension of that market but it will be certainly bigger in terms of the number of patients
and the duration of therapy than the metastatic market. And it's a market in where there is a significant unmet medical

need and we are pleased to see that we have been the first in starting a Phase III trial in that clinical setting.
<A - Paulus Stoffels>: Yeah, and to add to that we see very exciting results on the combination of ARN-509 and
ZYTIGA. We brought it on board to get to a better combination therapy, better outcomes and that is clearly visible in
the ongoing clinical work so we expect to see significant improvement on the outcome for combination therapies and
that's the basis we are building the future on for our prostate cancer franchise.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: And my follow-on question has to do with INVOKANA. Just schematically, how big an
accelerator do you think it'll be to have the combination of metformin and INVOKANA in a single administration?
<A - Joaquin Duato>: That's a great question. We are very pleased with the launch of INVOKANA as Alex
mentioned. It's been the most successful launch in type 2 diabetes since Januvia and we are now the leading oral
anti-diabetic in type 2 among U.S. endocrinologists. The combination of metformin have very relevant one. The most
relevant combination we have that combination approved in Europe with the name of VOKANAMET. We're expecting
a response from the FDA with a PDUFA date in August. So we think it's going to be an important element for
physicians and will have a significant impact in our business moving forward.

Your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hi, David.
<A - Paulus Stoffels>: Hello, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Two questions. I was going to start off with Alex.
Operator
[indiscernible] (01:36:36)
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Hello?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. Go ahead.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Go ahead, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Sure. Okay. Got a little confused there. So there's two quick questions. First, Alex, I wanted to
give you an opportunity to maybe break a tie here. At the Analyst Day, we heard two messages in MD&D – at least we
did. In the morning, we heard from a lot of your non-orthopedic segments that there was not significant benefits to
scale and in the afternoon we heard a totally different message from Michel, which is that scale really does matter, and
he thinks scale is going to be a driver of share. And you talked a little about your breadth and depth in MD&D and I
wonder if you can just help us out. Your view on scale driving share in medical devices, what is that view? And why do
you think we heard different messages from some of your senior business leaders in the morning sessions versus the
afternoon sessions that's really focused on orthopedics?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Well, David, I'm not sure that the messages were that inconsistent overall. And the way that I
would answer that is we do believe scale and size and depth and breadth is going to be important across MD&D and
that has to do with evolving customers right now. I mean, when you think about the healthcare landscape going forward
whether it's hospital systems in the United States, whether it's governments in Europe or in the developing markets, we
see the opportunity for broader partnerships to be something that customers are both wanting and something that we

can definitely provide.
Now I think there's not just one flavor. I think it depends on the system. It depends on the specific customer as to what
kind of partnership they may want to have. And I think there could be certain opportunities where a customer might
desire to look just across their orthopedics portfolio or perhaps their general surgery area to doing a different kind of
partnership, where other systems who might be a bit more mature, might look for something broader across the entire
portfolio. So I think that's likely the difference in messaging that you heard between some of our global surgery and
orthopedics, but overall, we do think that we see that as a long-term dynamic and something that will be important and
frankly one where we're positioned very well.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Thank you, Alex. And maybe just a follow up for Dominic. Dominic, given the strength
that you've seen in the first half of the year, specifically OLYSIO, I guess we're a little surprised that there hasn't been a
more aggressive reinvestment of that upside. [audio gap] (01:39:08) we're probably going to see here in the back half of
2014. As you think about next year as we head into this year, many investors are focused that if there was going to be
OCD-related dilution, you'd offset that with probably more aggressive buyback activity. As we head into 2015, is it
likely we see more aggressive buyback activity to offset some of the OLYSIO headwind? Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: So a couple comments on the impact of OCD. For this year, the OLYSIO benefit does in
fact help us absorb the lack of OCD earnings in the back half of the year. Plus, we are investing in the back half of the
year. So our margins overall will not be as significant as you saw in the second quarter because we do intend to invest
in the back half of the year for future growth while still overall providing higher earnings than we previously estimated.
The share buyback that we talked about regarding the proceeds of the OCD divestiture, we will do that, but we'll see
that impact in 2015, of course, because the ability to have an impact of a share buyback this late in the year in 2014 is
very small, but that will help us offset the dilution in 2015, David.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thank you. We'll take two more questions with respect to everybody's time. Next question,
please.

Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. One for Alex and a follow-up for Dominic. Just wanted
to be clear on what you're saying with cardiovascular. I know you said that you have a great asset and certainly this
quarter shows it with Biosense Webster. Are you still very much committed to cardiovascular more in a waiting and
watching mode to make the right move, or are you more in the decision of trying to figure out whether you are
committed to cardiovascular?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Kristen, thanks a lot for your question. And let me first of all complement our EP business and the
cardiovascular group for the performance they had this past year. I believe now we've got over 10 consecutive quarters
of double-digit growth and when you think of the new technologies like CARTO and others, it's resulted in great,
frankly, advancements for patients and as well as great growth opportunities for our business.
And I would answer your question saying, yes, we remain committed to cardiovascular. That being said, we know that
we have to be very thoughtful about where we're going to compete and how we might expand our position in that
particular market. So as you said, we're doing watchful waiting at this point in time. We continue to watch the other
segments, new technologies as they come in, seeing what kind of opportunity they may present and, we think we'll be
well-positioned going forward based upon how those dynamics evolve.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Perfect. And then for Dominic, I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the
pricing? I know Louise has mentioned surgery. Can you just talk specifically about overall Orthopedic pricing if that's
intensifying? And then I think for the first time I've seen you mention competitive pricing dynamics within Vision
Care. Maybe just expand upon there or any pricing trends within the Surgery business as well?

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah, sure. I'll let Louise give specifics on Orthopedics pricing, but we did see a continual
trend, by the way – it's not really new, a continual trend of negative pricing across the medical device space in
Orthopedics, in Surgery. We've also seen various competitive pricing dynamics even in the Vision Care business and
we're comparing this now to last year. So we do see increased competitive pricing dynamics and the market is looking
for lower pricing of products. And in Orthopedics in particular this quarter, we saw it. And, Louise, you have a
particular – the impact for Orthopedics.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Yeah, so in terms of Hips in the U.S., we're seeing a very similar trend of price mix change.
So the price is down about 4%, but there's a positive mix, so it brings it down to about 3.5%. And in terms of Knees,
we have in terms in the U.S. price down about 2.6% but there's a nice positive impact of mix of about 1.5%, so for a net
of about 1.1%.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And Trauma?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Trauma is a net price, so net price and mix together positive of about 2.2% and that's a small
negative in the price of about 1% and a positive in the mix of about 3%.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. Final question, please.

Your final question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Jami.
<Q - Jay Olson>: Hi. It's Jay Olson for Jami Rubin.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Oh. Hi, Jay.
<A - Paulus Stoffels>: Hi, Jay.
<Q - Jay Olson>: Hi, Dominic. Hi. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the questions. A couple quick ones.
First with regard to the Synthes tender in Trauma, can you just help us understand the dynamics behind winning these
large tenders and specifically can they be replicated in other regions? And then how do you prevent these large tenders
from being driven by price?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Yeah, thanks, Jay. Yeah, again, building on the earlier question, we do think this is an opportunity
where our breadth and scale is helpful particularly when customers are prepared to deal with the broader offering and,
in this case, we're able to provide it. We have definitely benefited from that. And we expect that to continue in other
areas as the market continues to transform.
And I think regarding how do you keep that from becoming just a pricing issue, I think it has to do with, one, the level
of innovation that you're bringing forward; two, what's the overall partnership and solution that you are building with
that particular customer that we think will be instrumental in helping us keep good, solid growth going forward.
Louise Mehrotra
Thank you very much. And some closing remarks from Alex.
