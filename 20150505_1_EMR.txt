MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to today's Emerson Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all
parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This
conference is being recorded today, May 5, 2015.
Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the
company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary
materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with
the SEC.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson.
Please go ahead.
Craig Rossman
Thank you, Robert. This afternoon I'm joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and
Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's second
quarter of 2015 results. The conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on
Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the
website for the next 90 days. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on slide two of the presentation.
Net sales in the quarter decreased 7% to $5.4 billion with underlying sales flat. As a result of lower oil prices, capital
spending reductions by global customers in oil and gas markets, particularly upstream, were faster and more significant

than expected. A broad slowdown in industrial spending, particularly in North America and China, and most
pronounced in energy-related markets, affected order rates and resulting sales in the quarter. The strength of the U.S.
dollar continues to be a significant headwind.
Order rates reflected economic conditions – difficult economic conditions in the quarter beyond oil and gas. Continued
weakness in European short-cycle spending impacted demand. However, Europe is beginning to show signs of
improvements benefiting from the depreciation of the euro. We expect European competitors to continue to use the
weaker euro to their advantage. Global telecommunications customers continue to cut capital spending across all
geographies, and Climate Technologies order rates were affected by the U.S. residential air conditioning pre-build in
the previous two quarters.
Turning to slide three. Gross profit margin declined 110 basis points to 40.1%, driven by volume deleverage resulting
from the sudden drop to flat underlying sales growth after two quarters of moderate growth specifically in the U.S.,
which turned negative after two quarters of 8% underlying sales growth. Gross profit margin also reflected unfavorable
business mix and higher costs related to increased strategic investment in 2014. Reported earnings per share increased
84% to $1.42. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 16% to $0.65, excluding a $0.77 gain on the sale of the power
transmission solutions business. Current market conditions will require more focus on the execution of strategic
programs.
Turning to slide four for the second quarter P&L summary. As mentioned, net sales decreased 7% versus the prior year,
while gross profit margin was down 110 basis points. Included in the results was a $932 million gain on the sale of the
power transmission solutions business and restructuring spend of $44 million. 15 million shares were repurchased
during the quarter.
Turning to slide five. Underlying sales growth in the quarter was flat, excluding unfavorable currency translation of 5%
and an impact from divestitures of 2%. By geography, demand was mixed with the Middle East and Africa up 5%,
Europe up 2%, Asia up 1%, while the U.S. was down 3% and Latin America was down 7%.
Turning to slide six. Business segment margins declined 260 basis points to 13.2%, primarily due to volume deleverage
and unfavorable mix. Operating cash flow decreased due to lower operating results and investment in working capital.
Operating cash flow will take a couple of quarters to recover. Trade working capital performance was also affected by
the business slowdown.
Turn to slide seven for the Process Management segment results. Process Management underlying sales grew by 2%
with a 5% reduction from currency translation, resulting in a net sales decrease of 3% in the quarter. Upstream oil and
gas activity slowed as a result of industry capital budget reductions while downstream activity continued to be a bright
spot, particularly in the power and chemical and petrochemical markets. Demand in Asia was up 6% with strong
growth in India and other emerging markets offsetting a slight decline in China while Europe was up 7% with
double-digit growth in emerging markets. The Middle East and Africa was up 3%, reflecting favorable activity levels
across the region. Margins were down 350 basis points due to unfavorable mix, the impact of the stronger dollar on
operations, higher levels of investment spending, and increased restructuring. Demand is expected to remain weak for
the next 12 months.
Turn to slide eight for the Industrial Automation segment results: Industrial Automation net sales decreased 16% as
currency translation deducted 6% and divestitures deducted 8%, resulting in an underlying sales decline of 2% versus
the prior year. Second quarter results were affected by weakness in short-cycle European demand, upstream oil and gas,
and industrial spending in energy-related markets. Geographic demand was mixed with North America down 1%,
Europe down 2%, and Asia up 1%. Reductions in upstream oil and gas spending continued to negatively affect order
rates in the power-generating alternators and electrical distribution businesses. Margins decreased 130 basis points,
reflecting volume deleverage, unfavorable mix, and a 40 basis point impact from divestitures. We expect market
conditions to remain mixed with some improvement in Europe and continued weakness in the energy-related markets.
Turn to slide nine for the Network Power segment results. Network Power sales decreased 9% as currency translations
deducted 5% and divestitures deducted 1%, resulting in an underlying sales decline of 3% versus the prior year.

Decreased global demand for telecommunications power business continued while the data center business decreased
moderately, reflecting continued weakness in infrastructure investment. Geographic results varied with Europe up 4%,
benefiting from hyperscale data center project revenues in Sweden, while North America was down 7% and Asia was
down 5%. Margins decreased, reflecting volume deleverage, unfavorable mix, and increased restructuring. In the
second half of the year, we expect improving data center market conditions with continued weakness in
telecommunications power spending.
Turning to slide 10 for the Climate Technology segment results: Climate Technology net sales decreased 6% as U.S.
air-conditioning customers work through pre-built inventory from the previous two quarters. Underlying sales declined
3% as currency translation deducted 3%. Asia was down 2% as growth in India, Australia, and Southeast Asia
air-conditioning and refrigeration businesses was more than offset by slowing demand in China. In other regions,
Europe had slight growth of 1%, Middle East and Africa was up 35%, and Latin America was down 19%. Modest
underlying growth in the second half of the year will be led by the HVAC and refrigeration businesses.
Turn to slide 11 for the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment results. Commercial & Residential Solutions
underlying sales grew 3% with a 2% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales growth of 1%, led by
favorable market conditions in the U.S. Growth in the food waste disposers, storage, and wet dry vacuums more than
offset declines in the professional tools business. Recent softness in the professional tools business reflects reductions
in oil and gas related spending. Favorable trends in U.S. construction markets are expected to continue, supporting an
outlook for moderate growth in the second half of the year.
Turn to slide 12 for the 2015 outlook. The global macroeconomic environment will continue to be challenging for the
remainder of 2015 as strong headwinds with lower oil prices, strength of the U.S. dollar, and a broad slowdown in
industrial spending, particularly in North America and China, will place downward pressure on underlying sales growth
across most of our businesses. Visibility is limited in this environment, so our focus will be on controlling what we can.
Near-term profitability will be negatively affected by volume deleverage as a result of the rapid decline to lower
underlying growth expectations. Therefore, restructuring will continue to be accelerated and will now be expected to
exceed $140 million for the year.
Based upon these market conditions, we now expect 2015 net sales to decline 7% to 5%. Underlying sales growth is
expected to be 0% to 2%, excluding a negative impact from currency translation of approximately 5% and a 2%
deduction from divestitures. Reported earnings per share are expected to be $4.17 to $4.32, including a significant
reduction from currency translation, the power transmission solutions divestiture gain of $0.77 and accelerated
restructuring costs of $0.09 per share.
And I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much, Craig. I want to welcome everybody and thank you for joining us today, both the shareholders
and investors. I'll probably be a little longer than normal. I have some things I want to get out and discuss with my
shareholders.
Clearly, we had a very challenging, tough quarter. And the market headwinds that we're facing today have become
much stronger just over the last 60 days. But as you know, we know how to deal with it. We've been here before and
the necessary actions, reviews, executions are underway. And there will be more on this in a few minutes. We will
continue to execute the tactical and strategic actions required to create long-term shareholder value for this company.
The board, the OCE and the senior management team fully understand and fully debate what needs to be done, the
timing, the actions and when and how we'll go about it.
Our actions clearly have been underway since February when we talked about this at the Investor Conference. But
given the stronger and broader headwinds, we'll now need to be deeper, broader and even more properly measured
against where we're trying to take the company long-term. April underlying orders appear to be shaping up to be down

5% to 8%. So let's step back and review where we've been, what we're up to, the actions and with the discussions that
we're having internally and basically how I see this as we're going forward.
Now, consistent with what we've been seeing in our monthly orders, we had a tough second quarter after underlying
sales for the corporation being nearly 5% the last six months before this quarter hit us. The dramatic slowdown for the
precise accountants out there is probably 4.75%. But for Dave, it's nearly 5%. The slowdown in capital spending in the
oil and gas industry and the related markets has been faster and deeper than we anticipated. This has had a significant
effect on the sales and profitability of our Process business, resulting in deleverage and some unfavorable mix and
actions will be needed to improve that at the proper speed. The overall impact has been a sharp drop in demand across
most of our industrial businesses across the U.S.
There is a lot of business around the oil and gas that's being impacted; it's just not oil and gas spending. Capital
spending and telecommunication equipment has decreased sharply, sharply since early this calendar year as key
companies in the space reduce investment levels due to slowdown in the economy, due to regulations, due to laws,
whatever, being put upon them and our customer base. The sharp decline in the continuing transition in the data center
designs had negatively affected the results of our Network Power business, but there's nothing new and different from
what we're seeing and we're taking the actions there also to protect ourselves.
Overall now, the trailing three months with April is going to be around negative 8%. This tells me the third quarter will
be challenging. Third quarter sales could be negative, slightly negative underlying. Clearly with the dollar, they will be,
but slightly negative underlying unless there is a turn sometime in May and June.
We have been through down-cycles before. This is my third as CEO of Emerson Electric. We are confident the
businesses will come back strongly when the investment environment stabilizes. In 2009 and 2010, underlying sales in
our Process business declined for five consecutive quarters and then recovered strongly. Now ,we have no visibility on
when that happens again, but we do know investments will rebound and we need to make sure we take the cost actions
needed to temporary fix the profitability, but also keep in mind we're not going to jeopardize our core technologies or
market share.
As we've done in the past in this type of environment, we will be intensely focused on the levers we can control. Over
the last several years, we've made meaningful strategic investments to serve our customers and strengthen our market
positions, and now we need to refocus given the environment that doesn't look like growth, but flat at best. The markets
change and we need to react. We are taking the necessary target actions across this corporation across this world, both
at the business level and the corporate level, to get the costs in line for an environment we could be facing for many
quarters, maybe multiple years of tough growth.
The bottoms-up approach, each business unit is evaluating where we need to have the investments and where we do not
need those investments, where we need the capacity and where we do not need the capacity, how we deal with a
stronger U.S. dollar, how do we compete against euro-based competitors coming out of Europe or yen-based
competitors coming out of Japan who have created through currency movements a significant competitive advantage
on a price-cost situation.
We will continue to do the necessary restructuring. It will continue for the rest of this fiscal year and, as I discussed
with the board, most likely through the first six months of fiscal 2016 as we take the actions necessary to compete,
improve profitability and protect our market position in a world where the dollar is much stronger than it was just 12
months ago. Our current field, with the current actions we identified, to be 3,000 people across Emerson to achieve cost
reductions of at least $150 million and hopefully more on an annual run-rate basis. There will be more actions needed,
given what I see today and given the continued negative underlying growth rates that we've seen over the last three or
four months.
As you know and debated with me, both friendly and unfriendly, we have been actively repositioning and evaluating
our portfolio, to improve the profitability, to improve the core growth opportunities, and to improve the overall quality
of this company. We have divested 12 businesses with $3.5 billion of sales over the last seven years. These divestitures
have improved profitability and improved our growth rate. We communicated previously that we will continue to

evaluate the portfolio, and we have underway today the divestiture of our InterMetro storage business, which will
happen sometime before the calendar year is done.
We continuously discuss with the board the actions necessary both on acquisitions and restructuring and portfolio
management necessary to make Emerson a stronger, more profitable, faster-growing business. The board nor the
management team are afraid of taking the tough actions, and we will do what's necessary to improve our profitability,
our earnings growth, our cash flow in a very tough environment. We will continue to be very disciplined with our
capital allocation. We'll continue to look for the right acquisitions.
We took one small one to the board today. I'm hoping over the next 12 months we will see more assets available for us
to invest in. The current focus is on improving profitability in a no growth environment. Our current focus is to
improve our cash flow after we get through this dramatic downshift in our marketplace and take that money and invest
it in the portfolio that will give us growth and profitability going forward.
We will continue to aggressively look at the portfolio. We will take actions that are smart and disciplined. We will not
take knee-jerk reactions at this company. It's not the way I operate. We intend to return approximately $3.5 billion –
$3.8 billion to our shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases. Over the last three years, we
returned a total of $6.5 billion, or 63% of our operating cash flow, through dividends and buybacks. We will continue
to focus on high levels of cash returns to our shareholders, improving our portfolio mix, driving value, and doing what
we can do best in this type of environment.
We have been dealt a challenging hand, I'm not afraid of that hand. We are taking the necessary actions across this
corporation. The board is fully engaged. The board fully understands what needs to be done, and they're supporting the
management team to the tune of getting these things done. We clearly see the next six months as very challenging to us,
and we could clearly see the impact of a dramatic drop-off in spending in many of our core businesses, the much
stronger dollar; and I'm not talking about translation impact, I'm talking about the fact that our global competitors
coming out of Europe and Japan now have the unique advantage, so we need to take the necessary actions to protect
our position and improve our profitability over time.
There is no quick fixes here. This is hard work and this management team knows how to do it, and we will do it. I do
not like the quarter we just reported, but unfortunately, it happened and we'll take the necessary actions to go forward
from here. I appreciate the support of our shareholders, I appreciate the support of our investors, and I truly appreciate
the support of the board and the management team as we work hard here over the next 6 months to 9 months to
improve the position of this company and earn back the respect of our shareholders and our investors.
So with that, I'll open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<A - David N. Farr>: I can't wait for that first question. I've got my baseball bat out. I've got my Rally Monkey here.
And I'm getting a sword out. Who's first? Julian?
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Yes. Hi, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hello.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Just a question, first on the operations, because I guess your revised fiscal year guidance
implies operating margins bounced back quite a bit in Process and in Network Power in the second half of Q2. Just
wondered if there was some one-off or mix issues that hurt margins in those two businesses that you think go away?

<A - David N. Farr>: The big issue, Julian, is if you step back and look at what hurt the second quarter in a big way,
and we obviously have some hills to climb in the second half, is that our underlying U.S. sales were over 7.5% the last
nine months. Process was very strong in that time period. We went from underlying U.S. sales of 7.5% to negative 3%
in one quarter. We clearly, as we announced in February, we knew things were getting weak, but they happened very
quickly in a couple of key markets: U.S. and China and Latin America. We are sitting in a situation where our facilities
have been repositioned in the last couple of years in the U.S.
We moved position, production into the U.S., and now with a stronger dollar, we're having to move things around, and
we're sitting absorbing some fixed costs that we have to deal with which we had started initiating in early February and
we'll start getting some payback on that in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But still, we'll be facing this
headwind because of the dramatic drop-off in our – in some of our core businesses here in the U.S. and the market mix.
So what we're banking on right now is that we are quickly attacking the fixed costs, we're quickly attacking the costs,
and what we're seeing is we'll see some profit improvement as the year goes on. That's the measurement we're going
after right now.
Am I got it exactly right or we've got it exactly right, it really depends how fast things drop off. But right now, that
fixed cost hit us real hard in the second quarter, and we're aggressively going after it. We spent I think around $45
million in restructuring in the second quarter. We're talking about spending another $65 million to $70 million in the
third quarter. So we'll start getting payback on that as we go forward, Julian, and that's where the game plan is, is we've
got to absorb that deleverage.
The other issue we've got going on right is, we're going to quickly attack the working capital which means we take the
production down, and that will have a little deleverage impact, too. So we're playing this game, we know how to play
this game, but I know that it's going to take us three months, six months, nine months to get through there to get that
effect, but we'll get the profitability back. There's nothing wrong with the core business that the profitability can't come
back on.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then just – you talked on the call and the release about tactical and strategic
actions and at the same time the need to avoid a knee-jerk reaction. So maybe just clarify the timeline of how you're
looking at businesses like Network Power in that regard, please.
<A - David N. Farr>: I put my sword in the ground, I think almost 2.5 years ago, I said three years, so I don't think the
timeframe has changed one iota. I just think that what we try to do at the board level is talk to the day-to-day, how do
we get our costs in line quickly to deal with the price-cost issues to deal with lower volumes.
And then strategically, you just don't want to ignore the strategic issues that we face as a company from a portfolio mix,
and we'll do that on a systematic approach that makes sense. I mean, as you well know, my focus is, if we're going to
decide to get out of the business, I want to get out of the business that creates value for my shareholders. I'm not going
to cut and run just to cut and run. I think that is the wrong thing, I think my shareholders would be very mad at me if I
did that. They expect me to manage the assets that we have here properly, and to create that value the best we can or to
realize that value. And that's – I'm no different. Genetically, that is how I'm built. And you know that.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much, Julian.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. Dave, on the Process, maybe a little bit more on the – on what you're seeing in the
different geographies. I mean, North America obviously gotten a lot of the highlights but China, LatAm, just what are
you seeing and what's your current view on where this might hit?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I do. I can give you a sense of that. Just generally from the businesses worldwide, the
U.S. looks for us as kind of shock – I'd say shakier for the next – from an industrial standpoint for the next two, three
quarters. Europe is slowly getting better. We had a better Europe as you know. The one place that I'm really concerned
about is China and the lack of investments and the slowdown and I'll get to specific businesses in a second. But clearly
overall macro right now, U.S. is a concern to me, China is a concern to me, Latin America is a concern to me. Europe's
getting – I think it'll – is getting slowly getting better, and then outside of China we're doing pretty well. And then
Canada has continued to invest as they're trying not to lose market share in the oil and gas markets.
But if I look at the various businesses, and I'm trying to get the chart here which has it broken down by world area, I
would say Process right now is seeing a tough time, a tougher time in China. They're seeing a tougher time in the oil
and gas companies in Southeast Asia. They're doing a better job in India. The Middle East has held up for us because
we had a lot of orders and they have not backed off, and orders have held up which surprises me a little bit. Process
outside of Western Europe is seeing an improvement, and I think we're going to start seeing an improvement out of the
Western Europe export business, so I think that will get better. Latin America I think right now is going to be a tough
year for process control, just Mexico, Colombia, Brazil.
So that's what – that's right now how I see it. I think we haven't reached bottom in certain markets and that includes the
U.S., and I think that we haven't reached bottom in probably China or we haven't reached bottom in Latin America. The
rest of the places seem to be stabilizing and the nose seems to be coming up a little bit.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, great. And then just on this telecom piece, I mean, obviously it's hitting you very
hard right now. Maybe just – is that net neutrality-related stuff, or what else are you seeing there? And aside from – it
seems like that's kind of the near-term driver. Are you happy with the way the data center piece of the business is
performing? Just maybe a little split between the pieces?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I think, from my perspective, which it is really hard in the last four months is the dramatic
cut in spending from the standpoint of the impact of net neutrality and also there is some shifting going on in the
industry around the world and where money is being spent or not being spent. That's hit us pretty hard. That one, to be
honest, really caught us, I mean, a little bit surprised with the dramatic cut back and how fast these guys can cut back as
they re-shift their priorities. And that hurt us quite dramatically. And we're about going after the fixed costs there and
take the capacity out and [ph] downside (29:39), but that takes us a couple of quarters.
In Europe right now, our Network Power data center enterprise business, I like the improvement we're seeing. I see
slow gradual improvement. I would say in North America right now there has been very little improvement. It goes up
and down quarter to quarter. The customer base is not really moving forward relative to spending money, and a big part
of that customer base also – excluding the telecom power but also the enterprise side of that – and we sell a lot into the
telecom space on the enterprise side, too, and they have really cut back on spending. And then the other place we've
seen a dramatic cutback is in China. The rest of that part of Asia is doing pretty well.
So there has been another hit here, and we're significantly taking restructuring across Network Power from a
technology and the products we have today, I like what we have; that's not an issue. It's just a fact of where we see it
coming at us at this point in time.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

<A - David N. Farr>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, so, Dave, appreciate all the extra detail on the actions. You mentioned a number of times in
the prepared remarks that you've seen your European and Japanese competitors using the currency advantage. It sounds
like they're starting to cut price or starting to be more aggressive on price. Is that true and how are you responding? Are
you having to respond with discounts? So maybe just describe a bit more on that, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: I think in the short-term in the second quarter, the price-cost issue, other than price-cost maybe
issues around outside the United States, have been minimal. There's been some price-cost issues relative to, say, the
Eastern European businesses because the way we are sourcing and the movement on that. The price-cost issues coming
out of Europe and the Japanese competitors, we see that hitting us more in the second half and going into early next
year.
So that's why we've got to get ahead of this curve because we know they will, we know that we've been here in this
case before. It wasn't in my first two years or three years as CEO that we had the euro at parity where we actually went
down [ph] to $0.85 (31:55). I saw how the European competitors acted at that point in time. And I would say they're
going to pick up the competitive nature of this. The amount of project opportunity out there I think still shrinking, so
it's going to be more competitive and they have an advantage with the euro and the yen where it is right now.
So we know their actions will be very, I would say, sharp on the pencils and sharp on the price. And we obviously will
do what's necessary to protect our share, but we're also not going to do stupid things from a standpoint of having to give
away price where we have a unique technology. So over the last several years, we have the dollar helped us quite a bit
and now we have it flipped and we have to get our costs back in line relative to where we source things and where we
position stuff, which we will do to be able to compete and protect our margins. But it will take us six months to nine
months. Don't be surprised. It will take us six months to nine months. We know how to play this game. And in the
meantime, we'll see them coming at us. It will be more in the second half of the year on the pricing actions.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And where do you think you're going to see the bulk of this pressure? Do you think it's pretty
broad-based? Or do you think it's more centric with Network Power and Automation?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think it's going to be broad-based. I think you will see it across the industry.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: U.S. companies have had a unique situation where, I would say, if you go across the U.S., I
don't care what company you talk about, be it industrial or consumer, U.S. companies have done very well in the last 10
years in gaining market participation in the U.S. marketplace. And I think you're going to see some of the foreign
competition taking advantage of this dramatic shift in the dollar-euro, dollar-yen situation. No doubt about it. It's not
just going to be Emerson Electric, trust me.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: No, no, I think you're right there. Then just a quick one on Process margins. It seems like your
guidance has baked in a sequential improvement in Process margins, which is what we normally see seasonally. But as
Process goes negative in the back half of the year, which creates a bit more volume pressure, you mentioned you have
to cut the inventories. Do you think that Process margins have bottomed in 2Q or do you think there's a bit more
pressure in the second half of the year?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, I don't know what [ph] the margins are going to do (34:03) Q2. I mean, I would say they
got hit pretty hard this quarter and based on what I see is they normally would come back up. Steve Sonnenberg and his
whole management team have worked extremely hard very early on in the restructuring. So I would say they're going
to get a little bit better. From my perspective, I want to figure out how to get their margin back up and so for the whole
year get back more in line to where they should be. But there are a lot of things moving in that second quarter, even
including relative to settling a litigation suit. So I think that we'll get the margins back up in the third quarter and fourth
quarter.
But clearly these guys are taking actions. Right now, I would say, of the actions underway, Process Management and
Network Power have been the big, big spenders of the restructuring, both in the second quarter and then in the third

And we will take our next question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Hey. Thanks and good afternoon, Dave and Frank.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Steve.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: I like that enthusiasm.
<A - David N. Farr>: I can't decide, is there any reason to come to New York? You've already asked all the questions,
[ph] you're probably thinking of asking (35:25).
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: There's always more, Dave, and really get into it, right?
<A - David N. Farr>: So I'm going to allow you to take two questions from me in the whole hour we're going to talk.
Okay. And you know I'm very slow in answering questions.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Just bring the baseball bat, okay?
<A - David N. Farr>: I've got it right here, partner.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: So, listen, there was a time when you used to talk about the strength of the dollar being
good for Emerson or a stronger dollar being good for Emerson.
<A - David N. Farr>: A stronger dollar is good for the country, I said.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. So I just want to talk about the cost base, though, for you. I mean, as you've gone
international here on the dollar, what are the things that you can do beyond just the restructuring on the material side?
Are there other things you can do that could actually change the margin story a little bit and help you on the pricing
front as well?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, one thing Emerson does have, as you well know, we have a very global manufacturing
base, say, for Process. So we can shift where we make the product, either into Mexico, either into Eastern Europe,
either into Asia and rebalance that to take advantage of where the currencies have weakened along, like with the euro
or like the yen. So we have very strong manufacturing facilities in Mexico and we have very strong manufacturing
facilities in Eastern Europe.
So you'll see us already, and the capacity's sitting there, so you'll see us immediately moving it. We had just gone
through a process over the last 12 months of moving manufacturing back into the U.S. And now with the capacity we
have in certain, like all best cost locations, versus the dollar and the euro, we're going to quickly move there.
The other thing, we have to start moving our sourcing from the standpoint of both internally and externally. And that
takes six months to nine months. So there we can get our costs back in line to get our margin back up, both through the
restructuring effort and moves, but it takes us time. And that allows us the pricing flexibility necessary to compete
against countries that are playing the currency game against us. We as a nation, that's why I believe in a strong dollar, I
think you cannot have a nation as a weak currency, I believe quite strongly that we will take the actions necessary to
move stuff around the world and we have that flexibility to do it. And we will do it and it's already underway.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And what's baked into your planning and thinking, your best thoughts about trough
volumes here? I mean, what are you thinking about oil prices? How important is that at this point to your sort of calling

it volumes starting to get better in two quarters or three quarters? Or what are you thinking on that front?
<A - David N. Farr>: My plan right now is that there's no growth. And you can say two quarters, three quarters, four
quarters, five quarters, six quarters, and at what it takes for us to have increased earnings as we move out into that 2016
time period is what I'm focused on. What actions do we need to fix the cost structure to compete in a no-growth
environment to allow us to show earnings growth and make 2015 the bottom of this one? That's my game plan.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: But when are you thinking things don't get any worse, maybe? Maybe that's the way to say
it from a volumes perspective.
<A - David N. Farr>: If I was that good, I wouldn't be a CEO anymore, because I could go out – and you wouldn't get
quite the same publicity that you have every time you open a newspaper about how overpaid we are and how we try to
hurt people. And I don't know. I mean, from my standpoint right now, I think as I look at the U.S., I look at what's
going on. I look in Europe. I think you're probably talking early 2016 before you start seeing, you can say, things are
turning back up, even on the underlying volume basis.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. Thanks, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.

And we will take our next question from Mike Wood with Macquarie.
<Q - Mike Wood>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, Dave. Just at a high level, you spoke about oil prices a bit, but
WTI crude did fall as low as $45, now it's back above $60 today. Curious what type of lag that you see when you're
talking to customers with bidding or quoting activity, and how you might think that recent improvement could impact
orders?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't – I think the people – I don't think that our customer base will move much in the thought
process in going from $40 to $60. I think these guys, as our customer base is now, they've been shocked, they've been
hit, they're reallocating capital. They have their own thing. They're looking at, I think, there's going to be some
probably consolidation in this industry so some capacity could be coming out. So I think this space right now has been
– has set at a price expectations that it could easily get hit again.
And so these guys are managing their capital allocation, so actually they're going to cut spending probably for at least
12 months to 18 months, and that's my view of it right now. And I don't – I think there is more downward potential on
the price of oil given what's happening in the world to slow us down, what happens maybe in the Middle East if there's
an Iranian deal. And let's say that there's more potential of oil coming in the marketplace, so I think they need to be
very cautious and I think they will be very cautious.
<Q - Mike Wood>: Great. And then the $0.09 restructuring that you had cited, should we think about that paying off
on a one-to-one dollar ratio? And have you taken a look at your CapEx R&D goals, or any areas you can respond there
as well? Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I think historically our restructuring is one-to-one. And so right now, the number we're
looking at is about $140 million. I would say as the year goes forward, that number's going to move towards $150
million, $160 million for the fiscal year. Most likely, as you look at it – if you look out beyond that in total price of the
cycle, we'll probably end up spending over $200 million in setting the cost structure of this corporation.
And capital right now, based on what I see, we're going to try to curtail a little bit, but I have set in motion some
redeployment of capital that we had started about 18 months ago in sort of Eastern Europe and also in Mexico, and I
also have, what I would call, risk hedging and capital from a standpoint of where I manufacture things. So I don't see
our capital taking a dramatic drop-off, but I would say as we get into 2016 and 2017, that capital number as a percent of
sales will come down.

And we will take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Thanks. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Chris.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Hello there.
<A - David N. Farr>: How's that baseball team of yours doing?
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Oh, God. I want to go back two years ago. You got any starters you can send our way?
<A - David N. Farr>: We need a couple pitchers. We need a pitcher. We lost our base, our ace.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Sorry to hear that.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: The trade deadline's a ways out.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're sorry to hear that? That didn't sound very real, Chris.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: The trade deadline's a ways out, you've got some time. Dave, in the past and today,
you've kind of described the accordion aspect of your global cost structure and ability to respond to things like
currency. I'm guessing maybe there's a pretty big magnitude of opportunity to leverage that in Process, but I'm
wondering if you could describe sort of the scope of what can be done there.
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean, from our perspective, we can move it around, and it takes us time. We can both – not
only Process but Network Power, Network Power has the same flexibility both in Mexico as they do in Eastern Europe
as they do in China. And so, Network Power has the same capability as does Process, as does climate, as does most all
of the industrial businesses.
So I – from my perspective, we're going to go after that moving where we source. The biggest opportunity for us is
actually sourcing where we know the dollar-based sourcing had become very competitive for us for about two years or
three years. Now we're going to start shifting out, and that will create non-dollar-based sourcing, which means there are
probably less jobs in the U.S. and more jobs other – around other places around the world. So we're already underway
here, and our cost of goods sold, pressures – our SG&A pressures, we can deal with those things.
And, I mean, it's a game plan we know how to play. We also know it's going to take us six months to nine months, and
we'll slowly get some benefits as we move into the second half of this year. It's – that accordion is still – is very
workable, and we've had a lot of tactical meetings here within the corporation in the last five days or six days, and as
we try and expand this thing and taking a real serious look at what we think is going to happen in the next three
quarters, four quarters, five quarters. So the accordion's moving right now, and it's going to be moving pretty rapidly.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay. And then just going back to March, it seems like April didn't get any worse or
maybe a touch better. You mentioned some things, the nose turning up. But what about what happened in March was
maybe one time in nature, whether it's channel flush or something else?
<A - David N. Farr>: Don't believe that.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay.

<A - David N. Farr>: I don't believe that. I think if you look at the underlying – my personal opinion is I think
inventories in the U.S. are still too high given the pace of business. I heard numbers this morning from one of my
directors that import took a surge in the month of – I don't know if it's March or April – and that tells me imports are
already starting to come in. And so – you want to borrow a pen? Are you out of ink, Craig? He is sort of shaking his
pen.
But I think that this thing has got some legs to go here, because I think there's a shift going on as people adjust relative
to weaker demand and they also adjust as we look at this whole issue relative to imports going up and also the impact
on the sourcing, which we just talked about. So there's two or three layers here that you've got to go through, and I
think that will have an impact on U.S. operations of all companies.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Got it. Thanks. Have a good day.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome. Take care. I thought maybe you needed a pen the way you were shaking your
goddamn pen around there.

And we will the next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Hey, Dave, I'm actually at the OTC Show in Houston today, the Offshore Technology Conference,
and I was just at the Emerson booth, there were some good traffic there. But what I did notice was big emphasis on
reliability consulting, maybe less on trying to sell equipment, but more on a differentiated sell regarding efficiency,
energy savings and so forth. Is that going to be part of the go-to market strategy for Process over the near-term?
<A - David N. Farr>: 110% correct. The issue here is there has been such a strong expansion in the oil and gas
industry that the capacity went in very quickly, not necessarily looking at optimization, and now what we see with our
capabilities and the people resources and our technologies is that we can optimize what they've already invested in, and
we see the focus from a customer really shift hard that way, and you clearly are seeing that in that trade show and
you're going to see that across not only the oil and gas but also the chemical industry and the power industries in a big
way. So you're seeing this, this is going to be the game plan on our solutions organization, Jim Nyquist is totally
focused on that. In fact, one of the acquisitions that we took to the board today is very, very much focused in that same
area. That's where the game is going to be.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Great. That's helpful. With downstream being one of the brighter spots, maybe you can comment
on how resilient your MRO business for Process has been? I know we had some refiner strikes. Are you seeing
deferred maintenance? What's the expectation for the MRO side of Process?
<A - David N. Farr>: We haven't seen any deferred action yet in the MRO, and that's another reason why we have a
big third quarter typically, third and fourth quarter, because we see more MRO action around that time period. So right
now we have not seen any slowdown in that. That would be the key issue for me relative to how our margins come
back. If we get into the second half of the year and then that day-to-day MRO, onesie-twosie business really disappears
then we'll have a lot more pressure versus the big projects. But right now it's holding up from the perspective of
day-to-day sales. So I feel okay about that.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Great. Thank you.

And we will take our next question from Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: How are you doing, Scott? How are you doing?
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: I'm doing okay. I'm trying to figure out the world, and a lot of your comments are pretty
bearish, so I'm a little concerned. I mean one of the things you mentioned, Dave, this is the third – I think you said
down-cycle since you've been CEO, and the Fed is still providing plenty of stimulus out there and you see it in the
lending data and such. I mean are we walking into a recession here? Or is this a – how do you define this, I guess? It
sounds like things are sequentially not getting better or in fact may be getting worse with the exception of maybe
Europe.
<A - David N. Farr>: I think free money has run its course. I mean where are we, in the eighth year of free money?
Free money doesn't do anything for us. I mean there's plenty of cash out there. Cash is not the issue. The issue is trying
to figure out how to get a sustainable type of demand. I think that what really is going on is we've had a couple of
major, major shocks to this industrial space that we operate in with the price of oil dropping off dramatically, I mean all
that spending going on with that shift in the dollar. And then also basically, there – the other – there's better jobs out
there, but the jobs numbers are really not that exciting relative to employment levels that we've seen just 10 years or 15
years ago. I mean, the workforce participation is not all that exciting.
And then you're seeing the global China growth slowdown. And Europe's getting better, but Europe's getting better at
the tune of 1%. So I don't think we're in a recession, I just think this – we're in this economic slowdown. And if they're
not careful here, you could bump this thing into a pretty tough period, and that's my standpoint. I just – I'm being – I'm
calling it the way I see it right now. I'm dealing with an issue where business has dropped off dramatically, and we're
going to have to deal with that. And I mean, I don't worry about calling recessions or not calling recessions, I'm taking
action now. And so, we are where we are and I'm not walking away from market share that we've gained over the years,
and we're going to figure out how to win that and protect it. So that's what I'm calling.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: I mean, it make sense.
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean, I don't call recessions. There's a Fed that does that. But I [indiscernible] (50:07).
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yeah, well, I guess I was just trying to get my arms at sequentially how much worse things
get. And are you the only guy who has the guts to call a spade a spade, or is everybody else just not seeing it yet or
something? But I guess that's for another conversation. But I guess the...
<A - David N. Farr>: I just have to be a little bit straightforward, honest guy.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yeah, no, historically, that's correct. If you look at your stock price, Dave, I mean it – based
on your commentary, it sounds, I mean, you could make an argument assets are overvalued, because earnings need to
come down still. But based on your stock price, I mean, it's pretty depressed. And how do you think about that versus

M&A? I mean, the M&A markets are still a little pricey, right, and it's going to be a while until prices come down, but
your stock is acting a little piggish here. I mean, at what point do you say buybacks may be a better plan and we'll buy
our stock when nobody else wants it?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, we did buying, as you well know. We're buying well over $2.5 billion this year, and we'll
continue to buy next year. Not probably at that level, but we'll continue to buy. Clearly, I don't – I think the stock has
been hit pretty hard and there's reasons for that, and people are challenged relative to our underlying growth. But I can't
worry about that day-to-day. I don't like the fact that stock has been hit hard. I'm just dealing with the facts right now,
and the facts show that the underlying demand out there is weak and may stay weak for several more quarters, and
word is going to get the cost to back down the line and to compete against our international competitors.
And if other companies don't want to do that, that's fine. Maybe other companies have better magic formulas, maybe
they're doing a better job. So be it. But right now I know what I'm dealing with and I know where I'm competing, and
we're not losing and I have no intention of losing, and we're just going to get across the line to make sure that we can
compete and drive the levels of profitability. I mean, even in a tough quarter, we still had a very strong underlying
profitability in this quarter. A lot of companies would love to have that underlying profitability in the quarter. But that's
not what Emerson finds acceptable.

And we will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey, Dave. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey. Also just thinking big picture here about the portfolio and how you do drive growth going
forward. I mean, if 2014 was peak cycle for Emerson, you just grew earnings 3% peak-to-peak over a six-year or
seven-year period of time. And obviously a lot of different stuff happened, but that's kind of the nature of my question.
Is...
<A - David N. Farr>: Not acceptable, Jeff. That type of growth is not acceptable.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. So...
<A - David N. Farr>: The issue is why our stock is sitting where it is right now. And I'm not a fool, I understand that. I
don't need to be told that and I fundamentally – we are a premium company and I do not like what we face right now.
So we're going to figure out how to get premium underlying growth both to the top line and the bottom line, both
through acquisitions, repositioning and restructuring. That's the game we're playing.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: I'm just thinking...
<A - David N. Farr>: I can't get more specific than that.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: So then just shifting to Network Power then. You did say in February that the businesses were
structured, you now just need to figure out how to drive profitability. Obviously you just keep getting fresh curveballs
in this business. I mean, other than kind of the passage of, for lack of a better term, probation period that the business
may be under, what is it that you're looking to see there in terms of a decision point?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think that from my perspective and what we're underway right now, I have everything I need at
this point in time to deal with what I need to deal with. But it's just a function of, as I said, if we're going to get out of
the business, I want to figure out how to create the right value for our shareholders. I'm not just going to dump and run

if that is the decision. So I think I pretty much have a good understanding of the marketplace. I see what I think what
we can drive the profitability level to. Yeah, we had a tough quarter, but a lot going on there. So I think it's a pretty
straightforward decision at this point in time. Now the question is what's the best way of within the execution to create
the right value for my shareholders?
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then just one last one on this FX at the price. It may be wishful thinking, but we hear a lot
of other companies say, oh, the Japanese and European guys aren't going to do that because they've got global
footprints like we do. And what goes around comes around on currency. Do you think there's any merit to that? I mean,
there's clearly nothing wrong with being girded for them to come after you, but do you think global footprints have
changed enough that maybe the behavior does not get as egregious as you fear on price?
<A - David N. Farr>: I have one simple answer. No.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: All right.
<A - David N. Farr>: I do not believe they changed enough.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: All right. Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it.

And we will take our next question from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Deepa B. N. Raghavan>: Good afternoon. This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. How are you today?
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon. How are you doing?
<Q - Deepa B. N. Raghavan>: Pretty good. Thank you. We hear you on right-sizing or optimizing cost structure and
M&A and return of capital. But the question is, do you have any thoughts on accelerating share buybacks at this point
in time, given where we stand right now with growth or CapEx or lack of opportunities in M&A?
<A - David N. Farr>: At this point in time, no. We're going to spend $2.5 billion in share repurchase this year. I would
expect right now we're probably going to be in the $1.5 billion range next year. Our focus is we're hoping to figure out
how to find some assets if this marketplace is slowing down from an industrial space, are there some assets out there
and we're obviously working at it real hard to be able to try to do more acquisitions as we get into 2016. Our preference
is to figure out how to – if we're going to position to move out certain assets, how to also try to get some acquisitions.
So we're working on that pretty hard right now. But at this point in time, the $2.5 billion of share repurchase this year is
set and I do not see us changing that. And I see next year being somewhere in that $1 billion to $1.5 billion range.
<Q - Deepa B. N. Raghavan>: Okay. A question on Network Power margins. I know it's being talked about in the
Q&A. But you put it at 3% this quarter. I mean, I know the target still remains 12% margins over a medium term. But
how realistic is it that we model for high-single digit margins for the full year -for your fiscal 2015 or do you think
it's...
<A - David N. Farr>: From my perspective, given the significant restructure underway in Network Power, I mean,
they're going to get hit at the EBIT line. And so it's going to be challenging. But we still believe that 10% to 12% is
doable as we reposition this cost structure and we get some kind of underlying improvement in particular in the telecom
space, which they'll come back within the next three months to six months. So the business model hasn't changed that,
you just go in and out of a quarter. So I don't think it's going to change.
<Q - Deepa B. N. Raghavan>: Okay. Last question for me. Tax rate for the full year, I mean, what's it on a normalized
basis, is it more 31%, 32% or 34%, 35% like last year?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Well, on an operational basis, we're looking at around 31%. The tax rate is inflated
because of a gain on the divestiture. But operationally we should be in the same, within a percent or so of where we
were last year.

And we will take our next question from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Hey. Good afternoon, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, John. It's good to see you.
<Q - John G. Inch>: I want to ask about, I want to go back to the currency issue. And we've been in this environment
where the yen has been weak for a while and it didn't seem as if the Japanese ever, for perhaps various reasons, stepped
up to try and do much about it. And then the in a relative perspective, I mean, the euro has only collapsed in a short
period of time. So just curious, what do you think is going on kind of around the world to all of a sudden have this
increasing price-based competition, which I don't believe is unique to you, all of a sudden happen? If it didn't really
happen for so long in Japan, why is it happening more rapidly given the relatively shorter duration of the euro's
decline?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think from the yen standpoint, it's just a function of in the early stages of the Japanese
recovery, there was more internal focus for investments as we saw inside Japan, and as that recovery has sort of
teetered out from the standpoint of the economics, and if you look at the underlying growth rates in Japan, they're not
that strong right now. They've had a turn externally, and we've seen a ramping up in the last 3 months to 6 months as
they've become much more aggressive around Asia and Europe and then also here in the United States. And it's just a
function, I think they deal with internally, and now they're coming back out quite strongly.
The European thing is a situation that we have been here before, we know what it's like, we know it takes a while to
gear up, and they've been in a situation where they not had real underlying growth in Western Europe for a while. So
now all of a sudden you're going to see those European EPCs, the European small businesses, the European large
businesses now be competitive so they can go out and compete against all the U.S. companies or other companies
around the world, and I think that is their natural behavior to do that. They're going to go. And we've seen that before. I
know everyone keeps saying they'll rebalanced, they're not going to do that, but I don't think they rebalanced that much.
And from my perspective, you could see why they would play that hand. You all of a sudden got a 25%, 30% of
competitive advantage just on the pure translation side. I think the game has been played before and I think it will be
played again.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah, no, especially in a slow-growth world, I makes perfect sense. I wanted to ask you more of
a strategic question around restructuring. If you go back to the last recession, right, lots of companies were able to very
successfully preserve their profitability despite the steep downturn because they all advanced their playbooks of
restructuring. I guess one of the questions or concerns I have and it's maybe less to do with Emerson, but I'd like to get
your thoughts on this is that as we go into what could amount to another downturn, and obviously it won't be nearly as
severe. But is there as much action to take to be able to preserve profits? Like, very simplistically, haven't a lot of
American industrial companies already downsized and implemented lean and other tools to the point where there just
isn't as much opportunity to cut costs if, in fact, we go to into more protracted slowdown? What are your thoughts?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think the answer is again, no. I think there are opportunities. I think there's been a lot of new
technologies. There's been new ways we can share technology and innovation, innovation around the world, and I think
companies can take advantage of that. And given the fact that the currencies don't move and the cost structure's don't
move, eked altogether it allows companies – that someone said earlier on the phone, the balance, I think that there is
opportunities. We see it today.
And so I don't think the game is over with. I think there's always room for this. It's maybe not China play this time,
where last time it was a lot of China play. This time you're playing with different spaces in different locations and

there's different approaches. So my fundamental belief is the answer is no. There's room to fix your cost structure, and
there's room to improve your profitability.
<Q - John G. Inch>: And one more, Dave. Do you believe your cost structure is more variable today given sort of this
technology in globalization versus past years, or is it really not that clear? Because obviously if it were more variable,
you could preserve your profits far better than perhaps anyone anticipates, right?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I think we are less manufacturing-based than historically been, so there's more – there's
people underestimate our software, they underestimate our systems and solutions capability; I think they all think that
we're just a pure manufacturing company and just misread that. I think the company has more variable costs than in the
past. I mean for us, we're dealing with this pretty quickly, and I think we have a lot more variable versus pure old fixed
large, fixed manufacturing plants.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Got it. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
<A - David N. Farr>: Take care, John. All the best to you.
<Q - John G. Inch>: You too.
David N. Farr
So from our perspective, again, I want to reiterate, it was a tough quarter. I appreciate it. I appreciate your patience.
Thanks for all the excellent questions. And I look forward to seeing everybody, and again, we are very much focused
on execution right now in the company, and the discussions at the board level is the last two board meetings are very
much based on the short-term tactical issues but also at the same time strategically, we want to return to a premium
value growth company, and we're going to figure out what it takes to do that.
In the meantime, we have some other issues we deal with, and we'll deal with those. So thank you very much, I look
forward to seeing all of you in the near future. Thanks.
