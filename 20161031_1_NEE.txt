With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John W. Ketchum
Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone.
Before I begin my remarks on our third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Matthew. As
you know residents of the Caribbean and southeastern U.S. were recently impacted by the severe effects of this
dangerous and deadly storm. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by Hurricane Matthew's
widespread destruction.
Since 2006, FPL has invested more than $2 billion to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid.
Earlier this month, when Hurricane Matthew affected FPL service territory along Florida's East Coast, these
investments benefited customers by resulting in fewer outages and faster restoration.
In response to the hurricane, FPL deployed more resources pre-storm than ever before, which together with its grid
investments enabled the company to restore service to 98.7% of the 1.2 million affected customers by the end of the
second full day after the storm left our service territory. At the height of restoration, FPL's workforce numbered 15,000
including our own employees along with workers from contracting companies and our partner utilities across the
country. I would like to personally thank each member of this team for their dedicated service during this critical period
for our customers.
In addition, earlier today, NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas
Transmission Holdings Corporation including TTHC's approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery
for total cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the
remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of
approximately $27 million.
If approved, these transactions when combined with NextEra Energy's previously announced merger with Energy
Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. I will provide
additional details on this announcement after reviewing our financial results.
Turning now to our financial performance, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered strong third
quarter results. In building upon solid progress made in the first half of the year, we remain well positioned to achieve
our overall objectives for 2016.
NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% from the prior year comparable period,
primarily reflecting contributions from continued investments at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources.
Equally as important, both principal businesses executed well on our major initiatives and it was a period of continued
advancement in our opportunity set for new renewables. At FPL, pursuing a balanced outcome in our base rate case to
support continued execution of our successful strategy for customers remains a core focus.
Since the last call, we completed the technical hearing for the case. And after months of negotiation, we are pleased to
have reached with three interveners, what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement that will
allow us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently and reliably for the benefit of customers.
A one-day hearing was held last Thursday to consider the proposed settlement agreement. We expect the Florida Public
Service Commission to vote on our agreement at their agenda conference on November 29. Our major capital
initiatives progressed well, and we were pleased to receive commission approval on our proposal to acquire and phase
out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility. I will provide additional details on these updates as well as FPL's solid
financial performance during the third quarter in just a moment.

At Energy Resources, contributions from new investments were the principal driver of growth and our major activities
remain on track to support delivery of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. We
continue to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities, and it was
an excellent period of new project origination.
Since the last call, I'm pleased to report that our development organization has added almost 2,000 megawatts of
renewables projects for post 2016 delivery to our backlog including approximately 600 megawatts of new wind
projects and roughly 1,300 megawatts of additional repowering opportunities within Energy Resources existing U.S.
wind portfolio.
We continue to conduct due diligence to identify the full opportunity set, and I'll provide our latest thoughts on our
expectations for repowering projects later in the call.
Energy Resources continued ability to expand its pipeline of growth opportunities is expected to benefit NEP. Since the
last call, NEP completed its third major acquisition this year from Energy Resources with the addition of an
approximately 132-megawatt share of high quality, long-term contracted solar generation. We continued to believe that
the scale, financial strength, experience and track record of its best-in-class sponsor are what set NEP apart from other
infrastructure alternatives.
This acquisition is also another example of why NEP is important to NextEra Energy as it highlights the value of the
Energy Resources contracted renewables portfolio, enables the recycling of capital from operating assets back into
development projects, and enhances NextEra Energy's tax efficiency.
NEP continued its strong year-to-date financial performance delivering third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash
available for distribution in line with our expectations. The NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $34.125 per
common unit or $1.365 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 26% from a year earlier.
Overall, with three strong quarters now behind us, we are well positioned for the year and are very pleased with the
progress we're making at both NEE and NEP.
Now, let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of
$515 million and earnings per share of $1.11, up $0.04 per share year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed
increased by 8.6% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2016. As a
reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined
regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.
We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a balance of $71 million. And due to higher base revenues driven by
weather-related usage and customer growth, we reversed $159 million of reserve amortization in the third quarter. We
believe the remaining reserve amortization balance of $230 million coupled with our current CapEx and O&M
expectations will allow us to support a year-end regulatory ROE of 11.5%, which is the upper end of the current
allowed range.
Based on what we see right now, we're likely to end the year with a positive reserve amortization balance, which under
the terms of the proposed 2016 rate agreement, we would be able to utilize over the next four years.
Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive approval from the Florida Public Service Commission, on our proposal
to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility, a 330-megawatt coal fired power plant that has a
contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025.
With an expected closing date for the transaction in early 2017, we plan to purchase the ownership interest in the
facility for $451 million including existing debt. Similar to the acquisition of Cedar Bay that we closed in the third
quarter of 2015, the transaction is expected to enable early retirement of one of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting
power plants in the state while also providing estimated customer savings of $129 million.

In addition, construction has continued to progress well on FPL's three 74.5-megawatt utility scale solar PV projects
that we expect to enter service this year. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the completed installation of
half of the 1 million new solar panels that will comprise these new solar energy centers.
Once complete, these projects will roughly triple the solar capacity on FPL system and add to the overall fuel diversity
of our fleet, which is important for FPL and its customers. Consistent with our commitment to provide low bills and
clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers, the proposed 2016 rate agreement, if approved, allows FPL
to recover in rates up to an incremental 1,200 megawatts of cost effective new solar generation approved over the
four-year term of 2017 through 2020.
This would allow Florida customers to benefit from favorable tax incentives, cost declines and efficiency
improvements in solar technology that together make universal solar a cost effective source of energy for our
customers.
The Florida economy remains healthy. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.7% is below the national
rate, and Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since 2012. The latest ratings of Florida's
consumer sentiment have remained close to post-recession highs.
FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 4% from the prior year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately
3.2% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, third
quarter sales increased 0.8%. Continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% was partially offset by a decline of
0.6% in weather-normalized usage per customer.
Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to average between 0% and negative
0.5% per year for the foreseeable future.
FPL was impacted by Hurricane Hermine in September 2016 and Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Although, FPL
has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of storm restoration cost is currently approximately
$350 million. Prior to the storms, FPL's storm and property insurance reserve had the capacity to absorb approximately
$112 million in additional storm restoration costs. The remaining balance of the storm restoration costs not covered by
the reserve will be deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on FPL's balance sheet.
Under the 2012 rate agreement beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the FPSC, FPL is
authorized to recover the remaining balance of the storm restoration cost on an interim basis from customers through
surcharges, plus an additional $117 million to replenish the reserve to the level authorized by the 2012 rate agreement.
Interim recovery is available for costs that, in total for the calendar year, do not exceed $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt
hours of usage on monthly residential bills based on a 12-month recovery period. FPL intends to file a petition with the
FPSC in the fourth quarter of 2016 to seek interim recovery of storm restoration costs under this mechanism.
As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the
expiration of our current settlement agreement. The proceeding has encompassed an extensive evidentiary process, and
during the quarter, we completed the technical hearing for the case and subsequently submitted our post-hearing brief
in mid-September.
After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early October with three of the interveners
in the proceeding; the Office of Public Counsel, the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association and the Florida
Retail Federation.
The four-year proposed agreement beginning January 2017 and ending December 2020 provides for retail base revenue
adjustments as shown in the accompanying slide and an allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.55% with a range of
9.60% to 11.60%, and no change to our equity ratio from investor sources. The proposed agreement also includes the
flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, plus any reserve amount
remaining at the end of this year under FPL's 2012 rate agreement.

As I mentioned earlier, the proposed agreement also provides for solar base rate adjustments, or SoBRA, upon
commercial operations of up to 300 megawatts annually of new solar generation subject to a cost cap of $1,750 per
kilowatt and a showing of overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers. We expect our regulatory capital employed to
be consistent with our rate case filing plus any incremental solar investment opportunities we move forward with under
the SoBRA, if approved, by the commission.
Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the
framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis
beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of
no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours of usage on residential bills during the 12 months of cost recovery.
Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800
million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover the amount above
$400 million.
The proposed agreement also authorizes a continuation with minor modification of the incentive mechanism for sharing
with customers the gains that we achieve in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities,
and introduces a 50-megawatt battery storage pilot program designed to enhance service for customers or operations of
solar facilities. FPL has agreed to not seek incremental recovery of the revenue requirements associated with the battery
storage pilot program until its next general base rate case.
We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive, and supports our continued ability to provide
clean, highly reliable, low-cost service for our customers through the end of the decade.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $307 million or $0.66 per
share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $279 million or $0.60 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to
third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.11, or approximately 22%, from the prior-year comparable
period.
New investments added $0.27 per share, including $0.14 from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio.
Contributions from new investments in natural gas pipelines were $0.13 per share, including a positive $0.09 impact
resulting from a reduction in the contingent earn-out liability that was recorded as part of the Texas pipeline acquisition
last year.
The earn-out, which was originally recorded at roughly $200 million, is required to be paid if contracts for growth
projects on the NET Mexico pipeline are signed by December 31, 2016 and if those expansion projects meet several
precedent conditions. Recently, NET Mexico completed a non-binding open season. While the results of that open
season were encouraging in terms of capacity expansion on the pipeline, we are still in the process of evaluating the
responses and are having discussions with potential shippers over precedent agreements.
However, based on the information we have to-date, we no longer believe that the full $200 million will be payable.
We will have a more detailed update in the fourth quarter earnings call, as we move forward to sign agreements with
the parties that have expressed an interest in new capacity.
The NET Mexico pipeline remains well positioned as it has one of the lowest capacity payments of any pipe serving the
growing Mexican market from the U.S. We remain confident that the Texas pipelines asset, which is owned by NEP,
will deliver on its adjusted EBITDA and CAFD growth expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition.
Partially offsetting the positive contribution from natural gas pipelines was a $0.09 per share decline in contributions
from our upstream gas infrastructure activities, primarily due to lower commodity prices and increased depreciation
expense reflecting higher depletion rates. On an annual basis, we would expect the $0.09 to be roughly $0.15 for the
full-year 2016.
The contribution from existing generation assets declined by $0.02 per share, partly reflecting the sale of Lamar and
Forney natural gas generation assets early in the year, net of interest expense. Fleet-wide wind resource was 100% of
the long-term average during the quarter. All other impacts reduced results by $0.05 per share, including the effects of

increased interest expense reflecting continued growth in the business and share dilution.
We remain enthusiastic about the fundamentals for North American renewables growth driven by the continued
execution of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to
capital and cost of capital advantages.
As you may recall, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a five-year phase
down period was further enhanced earlier this year by IRS guidance on start of construction. In addition to the
four-year start of construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities.
Among other things, the guidance provides for an 80/20 rule by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new
10-year PTC period, if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine's total
value.
Following our announcement on the last call that we are pursuing repowering opportunities at two of our existing Texas
wind projects, the team has continued to conduct due diligence on our existing portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, today
we are announcing plans to pursue additional repowering opportunities for roughly 1,300 megawatts to be completed in
the 2017-2018 timeframe. We expect to invest approximately $875 million of capital to complete these repowering
projects. And earnings from the projects are expected to be comparable to similar new build opportunities with
significantly less capital investment.
Based on everything we see now and inclusive of today's announcement and the announcement from our last call, we
expect this opportunity set to continue to grow to support a total of at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion of capital
deployment opportunities for repowerings over the next four years with a greater portion of incremental opportunities
expected to become actionable beyond 2018.
In addition to our plans to repower certain of our existing wind generation facilities, I'm also pleased to report
continued strong customer demand for wind. Since the last call, we signed contracts for roughly 600 megawatts of new
wind projects, including approximately 500 megawatts for post-2018 delivery. The attached chart updates additional
details on where our renewables development program now stands. Together with the repowering opportunities that I
just mentioned, we remain comfortable with the overall ranges we have discussed for 2017 and 2018.
The development activities for our natural gas pipelines remain on track. The Florida pipelines received FERC Notice
to Proceed in August and have commenced full construction activities. We continue to expect an in-service date in
mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeastern
Connection (sic) [Florida Southeast Connection] are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million respectively,
and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process. We continue to expect
approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments to achieve commercial operations by year-end
2018. NextEra Energy's expected investment is roughly $1 billion.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $174 million and $51 million respectively, and
strong contributions from new assets remained the principal driver of growth from the prior-year comparable period. In
addition, existing assets benefited from a favorable year-over-year comparison of overall wind and solar resource. As a
reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $10 million
from the prior year comparable quarter.
NEP has executed well against its growth objectives, highlighted by strong access to equity and debt markets. During
September, NEP was able to sell to the underwriters, at the time of the announcement, the full block of limited
partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition of a partial interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar Energy
Center.
This issuance, which raised approximately $297 million, was completed at a lower offering discount and lower trading
yield than the prior February offering, and demonstrated yet another source of capital for NEP as we were able to

access the retail market for approximately 75% of the issuance. In late September, the underwriters exercised the
over-allotment option, which allowed NEP to raise another $45 million.
NEP continues to target a long-term capital structure utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5 times project
distributions after project debt service, and based on this metric, we estimate our current incremental holdco debt
capacity to be roughly $450 million to $550 million.
Looking ahead, together with our at-the-market dribble program, we expect this debt capacity to allow NEP to continue
to be flexible and opportunistic as to future growth opportunities and financing activities.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy; for the third quarter of 2016, GAAP net income
attributable to NextEra Energy was $753 million or $1.62 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 third quarter adjusted
earnings and adjusted EPS were $809 million and $1.74 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate
and other segment decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2015.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, earlier today NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an
affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC's approximately 20% indirect
interest in Oncor Electric Delivery for merger consideration of approximately $2.4 billion.
In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor
Management Investment, LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these
transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy's previously announced transaction with Energy Future Holdings
for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. The total transaction
consideration implies an enterprise value for Oncor of $18.7 billion.
Under the terms of the TTHC merger agreement, NextEra Energy will pay TTHC 100% of the merger consideration in
cash. As a result of the transaction, no debt will reside at TTHC or Texas Transmission Investment upon close of the
merger. We expect to fund the merger consideration through a combination of debt and equity consistent with our
commitment to maintaining NextEra Energy's strong balance sheet and credit ratings. We believe the transaction
further affirms NextEra Energy's commitment to Oncor, its customers and the state of Texas.
As a reminder, NextEra Energy previously announced on July 29 a proposed transaction with Energy Future Holdings
that would result in NextEra Energy owning approximately 80% of Oncor Electric Delivery. The definitive agreement
is part of an overall plan of reorganization designed to allow Energy Future Holdings to emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy.
During the quarter, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved EFH's entry into the
merger agreement, and we were also pleased to achieve additional credit support for the EFH transaction. Although
there is inherent uncertainty involved with the bankruptcy process, we currently expect a creditor vote and confirmation
hearing in the fourth quarter in order to be in a position to receive bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan of
reorganization by the end of the year.
Separate from the bankruptcy approval process, together with Oncor, we look forward to filing by November 1 our
joint application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas seeking approval of our proposed acquisition. Based on
our current targets for completing key milestones and subject to required approvals, we expect the transactions to close
in the first half of 2017.
If approved, the transactions with EFH, TTHC and OMI, which would result to NextEra Energy owning 100% of
Oncor are expected to be meaningfully accretive to earnings enabling NextEra Energy to grow at or near the top end of
it's previously announced 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share growth rate through 2018, off a 2014 base.
Through the transactions, we see an opportunity to make two already great companies even stronger. In addition, we
expect that Oncor's credit rating will be improved post-closing generating real savings for customers in terms of lower
borrowing costs. NextEra shares Oncor's commitment to providing affordable and reliable electric service, and
providing high-quality customer service for the benefit of Oncor's customers and the continued economic growth of the
state. We believe the transactions are beneficial for all key stakeholders, including the state of Texas and Oncor's

customers, the creditors of the EFH bankruptcy estate and NextEra Energy's shareholders.
Setting aside the potential for accretion that we see with our proposed Oncor transaction, we continue to expect 2018
adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual
growth rate off our 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to
14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08.
For this year, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to
$6.35. Within this range, it is worth noting that we believe that we are well positioned to achieve results for 2016
towards the top end of our 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share expectations, again off our 2014 base of
$5.30.
We hope to be in a position to provide longer-term expectations at an investor conference this spring, following the
resolution of the FPL rate proceeding and required milestones in the Oncor approval process. As always, our
expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NEP.
From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see
12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to
our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of
$1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017.
The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $760 million and CAFD of $230
million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at
year-end December 31, 2016.
Today, we are introducing December 31, 2017 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975
million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted
portfolio at year-end December 31, 2017. The midpoint of this CAFD range reflects roughly 25% growth from the
comparable CAFD midpoint based on our December 31, 2016 run rate expectations. Our expectations are subject to our
normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
In summary, both NEE and NEP delivered excellent third quarter results and we're pleased with the progress we have
made on all of our major initiatives. At FPL, we continue to focus on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and
making long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do.
At Energy Resources, we have made terrific progress on our development program and continue to feel optimistic
about our renewables growth prospects and the quality of our renewables pipeline. For NEP, renewable origination
success at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of potential drop-down assets, and NEP has excess debt
capacity to enable it to be flexible and opportunistic regarding future growth.
Overall, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in our
industry.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that, we will open the line for questions.

<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: So, I wanted to touch on what you, John, had mentioned about repowering opportunities.
Very pleased to see the magnitude of that. I just wanted to make sure I understood your commentary correctly. You
were indicating that essentially the capital cost would be lower than new build, which certainly makes sense but the
return would be essentially as if we're at new build investment level. So, therefore, it looks like relatively attractive
return on capital. Did I get that right?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: You got that right. So, the CapEx is roughly half of the new build and the return is superior
to a new build transaction.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. Great. And in terms of just the kinds of steps you need to go through to actually
get these repowerings done, how should we think about execution risk, counterparty negotiations? How much is
required in terms of counterparty negotiations? What sort of things we'd be thinking about in terms of execution risk?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Well, on the execution side, we have to negotiate with our counterparties. Some of those
counterparty negotiations will include a blend and extend of the existing agreement. But given that, again, roughly half
of the CapEx for a new build and the returns are a bit higher. There is a little bit of room for those negotiations with
counterparties. That's one of the main execution risk that we have.
We also have to study the interconnection agreements to make sure that to the extent we're providing additional
capacity that we have the ability to put that additional capacity online. Those are the main execution risks around the
repowering opportunities.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. Understood. And you're laying out $2 billion to $2.5 billion of capital deployment
opportunities. So we can sort of do the math to look at the total megawatts involved then, I guess.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: That's correct.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. Sorry. And just one last question and then I'll get back in queue. We've seen a
number of companies announce their interest in becoming big in winds. We saw one company this morning lay that
out. I'm just curious if you could, at a high level, speak to competitive trends you're seeing, the kinds of barriers to
entry that you see from your perspective given you've been one of the biggest players in wind for very long time. I'm
interested in your perspective on that.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Sure, Steve. I'm going to turn that question over to Jim.
<A - James L. Robo>: So, Stephen, we've had competitors in this business for 15 years. They've come, they've gone.
There is no one in this industry that has the greenfield capabilities that we do. Plenty of folks lay out the fact that they
want to be in the wind business. And really what they're in is, they're in the wind development project acquisition
business at COD, which is, frankly, not really being in the wind business. Being in the wind business, 70% or 80% of
the value creation is in the organic development, the greenfield development of those projects.
And there's no one in the industry that has the pipeline that we do, that has the team that we do and the year-in and the
year-out track record. I worry about a lot of things, that's like very, very low on my list of things that I worry about.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Matt Tucker from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
<Q - Matt Tucker>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt Tucker>: Wanted to ask a few questions about the holdco debt capacity at NEP. I guess, first, just curious,
what kind of changed since you provided an estimate? I think when you announced Desert Sunlight that was about $75

million lower. I appreciate the math illustration you provided in the slides, but still wasn't clear what changed there.
And then just, how should we be thinking about how you are going to look to utilize this debt capacity? Is the target
something you'd look to reach in over the next 12 months to 18 months, over the next future transactions or how much
cushion would you like to kind of leave there for potential periods where you really don't feel like you can access
equity and want to continue to make acquisitions?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. So, a few things, on the holdco debt capacity, remember that we financed our July
dropdown with largely debt. We then went ahead and equitized the September drop. The cash purchase price for Desert
Sunlight was $218 million. We raised about $341 million in equity, which allowed us to pay down our revolver. That
really was the main contribution to the additional holdco debt capacity to get us to $450 million to $550 million.
In terms of the cushion on debt capacity, I really think that puts us in an opportunistic and flexible position as to how
we time future dropdown opportunities and as to how we finance those opportunities. So, we'll see how things progress
in terms of the capital markets going forward, but that does give us flexibility. Also, you got to remember with wind
assets, when we dropped the wind assets in, you can think about the leverage from tax equity being right around 45% to
55%. So, we're dropping those assets down, they're naturally creating additional holdco debt capacity at the NEP level.
<Q - Matt Tucker>: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then lastly, just your thoughts on the current wind outlook. Are
we completely passed El Niño? Are we seeing La Niña? Just what are you kind of seeing over the next six months to
12 months, or however far your outlook goes?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Well, it's tough to look out 12 months and really come up with what an accurate forecast
might look like, but certainly, we saw return to normal with our third quarter results. So, we'll see how the fourth
quarter progresses.
<Q - Matt Tucker>: Thanks, guys.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Well, good morning, guys.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Two quick questions. One, on the new contracted wind that is not repowerings, it is
the 100 megawatts in 2017 and 2018, and then 500 megawatts is post-2018. Should we anticipate that most of what you
do on the backlog is going to be longer dated going forward here, or is that just these are nature of some of the deals
you signed this quarter? Because I know you talked about being unsure whether tax credit extensions were going to
push things a little bit out.
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Hi, Jonathan. It's Armando. I wouldn't read too much into that. It is just really the pace
of negotiations. What I can say is that there is a lot of activity going on right now for both 2017 and 2018 and 2019 and
2020 in the contracting market. These two came in kind of at the right time for 2019, but I wouldn't read too much into
that other than just timing.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Is there – there you've got the irons in the fire still for 2017-2018, is fair to say.
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Yes. Absolutely. We still feel comfortable with the guidance or the expectations that
we've provided to you and we reaffirm today for 2017-2018.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Great. And then just, you obviously had a strong third quarter. Last time you spoke
publicly, I think you were sort of talking down the second half a little bit versus the first half in terms of growth. And
we have you at about 6.17% trailing 12 month earnings. I was curious why the guidance range you didn't take up the
low end or are there some challenges in Q4 that we should be thinking about or it feels like you're tracking pretty well

in the year.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. Jonathan, we did have a good third quarter, but with the fourth quarter, we still do
expect the growth drop off a bit compared to what we saw with 2015. And we are targeting again to be at the upper end
of our 6% to 8% range is the way to think about how we will finish the fourth quarter and the full year.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. So, you talked about some tax timing issues in the second half. Is that more a
Q4 item then or is that still...?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: There were some tax timing issues that had benefited the earlier part of the year. That's a
part of it. There were some other smaller things as well, not any one thing worth calling out or mentioning.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: All right. I think that does it. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Colin Rusch>: Thanks so much. I've got two questions. Can you just give us a bit more detail on what's in that
receivable due from a related party at NEP? And then secondly, with the wind repowering opportunity, given the pretty
dramatic price declines on battery storage with companies like LG and Tesla offering installations below $400 a
kilowatt hour now, how are you seeing that opportunity change? And is there a meaningful avoided cost PPA
opportunity that you guys are seeing right now?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. On the due from related party for NEP, recall that NextEra Energy provides credit
support to NEP. But as part of that credit support arrangement, NextEra Energy has the right to benefit from the cash
sweeps by taking cash out of those accounts, which it has an obligation to put back in for the benefit of NEP. So that's
what the due from related parties is.
On the battery question, I'll defer to Armando.
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Yeah. So, we've been talking about batteries now, I think, for a couple of years. And
we keep saying that we would expect batteries to be a significant investment opportunity for us, sometime earlier in the
next decade. And its tracking based on where we thought our expectations would be. We have roughly currently, boy,
I'm going to say about say about 10 battery projects across the U.S. and Canada, a little bit different technology in each
one. But these are fairly small investments that we're making in battery storage. Somewhere in the neighborhood of $6
million to $15 million is a potential average for each one of those investments.
Whether it's Tesla as you mentioned or whether it's other estimates that you and us have seen, I mean, battery storage
will continue to come down significantly through this decade. And we continue to believe that at some point in the next
decade, I don't know whether it'll be earlier or whether it will be later, but battery storage will be commercially viable.
The costs will come down enough that you'll be able to strap it on with the renewable technology, whether it's wind or
more likely solar, and have a very competitive project in the renewable energy space.
<Q - Colin Rusch>: Okay, great. I'll take the rest of it offline. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Thank you. So, how about one follow-up on the repowerings. So, how does the 50%
reduction of CapEx versus new build reconcile with this IRS requirement that it's an 80% increase in the value of the
turbine?

Page 12 of 13
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: You can't do that reconciliation, Angie. It's Armando. The way that the 80/20 works is,
obviously, for others on the phone, if you were to go out and completely tear down a wind project and start over, you'd
get PTCs on the new investment. Well, the IRS guidance allows you to do a whole bunch of work on those wind
projects and 80% of the value that you're putting in. If you meet the 80% test, the entire investment qualifies as new
production tax credits. It's based on a fair value method though, not based on a cost method. So, when John answered
the question before that it's a lot less capital for repowering opportunities and the economic returns are just as good or
better, he was talking about the cost that was going into the wind project, not about the 80/20 test.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. Yeah.
<A - James L. Robo>: So, Angie, this is Jim. Simply said, it's not 80% of the new build cost, it's 80% of the –
whatever you think the value of the existing asset is and the existing asset's been typically depreciated by 10 years or 11
years or 12 years. So, what you're trying to do is apples and oranges.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. And then all of the projects that are going to be repowered or are considered
repowering targets have PPAs. So there would be no merchants repowering?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Actually, Angie, all of the projects that we announced today that we're moving forward
on, on the repowering side are all projects that we have long-term hedges on. We have not announced any repowerings
of projects that have power purchase agreements. So, when John mentioned that our expectation that this could be a $2
billion to $2.5 billion program, virtually all of the remaining opportunities that we are looking at are under power
purchase agreements. And, therefore, we would have to have discussions with the counterparty, as John mentioned
earlier, to make sure that we can move forward on those. I feel comfortable that we would move forward on a vast
majority of those and that's why we gave CapEx guidance on the total program today.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. Thank you. And the last question on NEP. So I understand that you have the
corporate capacity you can use to finance growth. But you are the only one really with active IDRs among yieldcos.
And those IDRs require simply more and more assets to be dropped down in order to meet this 12% to 15% growth in
distributions per share for LP holders. And as such, basically, your funding requirements are growing quite
considerably as you move to high spreads. Would you consider, for instance, doing away with the IDRs in case there's
no recovery in the liquidity in the yieldco market on the equity side, or you feel like between co-financing via NextEra
or private placements you can actually create enough equity to achieve the growth and pay IDRs?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Angie, the way we look at it, I think the first thing to look at when you're dealing with
a yieldco like ours with a strong sponsor is, how many projects; I mean, what's the pipeline at the sponsor to be able to
drop down projects? Do you have a long pipeline of opportunities to be able to drop down into, in this case, NextEra
Energy Partners? Because if you have that, the current economics certainly work.
You talked about holdco debt capacity at the beginning of your discussion. I hope it's clear. I think we've made it clear
that we will not be reaching at least our preliminary holdco debt capacity target in 2017. We are slowly increasing the
debt capacity at NextEra Energy Partners. So, by the end of 2018, at least preliminarily we believe that we would get to
the holdco debt capacity, which gives us in this market a tremendous amount of flexibility as to when to be able to raise
equity and when to be able to raise additional holdco debt capacity. I think it's just too early in the life of NextEra
Energy Partners to really start talking about what we're going to do in the future with IDRs. We feel comfortable with
the way NextEra Energy Partners is working right now. It brings a lot of benefits to NextEra Energy.
We're certainly not comfortable with where it's trading. I don't think any management team is ever comfortable with
where their units are trading, but we feel confident that we, at NextEra Energy, will be able to have a sufficient number
of projects for a sufficient number of time in order for NextEra Energy Partners to be successful long-term.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Right. Thank you.

And we'll take our last question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Yes. I just had one follow-up. In terms of the market for tax equity and tax appetite, I
wonder if you could just give a commentary in terms of high level overall access, your position there, just your take on
the state of monetizing tax attributes.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. We have seen the tax equity market for our projects continue to hang in there,
Stephen. We've seen no issues. I mean, one of the things that that we try to do going into any one year is estimate the
amount of tax equity needs that we will have and then we allocate those to our tax equity providers going into the year.
So, really it has not been issue for us with regard to our projects.
