Additionally, any mention of operating expenses refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our
Form 10-Q, which includes research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative, but
excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate
to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency
when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign
currency rate fluctuations.
During Q1, we provided an update to our key investor metrics for fiscal 2017. We provide these additional metrics to
enhance our financial reporting results and provide transparency into our progress against our strategic imperatives. We
introduced three new metrics, Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage, total gaming revenue, and Windows
commercial product and cloud services revenue growth. We will be referencing these metrics throughout the
commentary today, and you can see them in our published KPIs on the IR website.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is
available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live
transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on
the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 20, 2017.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements
about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the
comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other
reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any
forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today, I'll share the results for the first quarter and
discuss how we're innovating to grow in each of our segments.
Overall, we are off to a good start in FY 2017. We delivered $22.3 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% in
constant currency. I'm proud of the continued progress. Our platforms are leading profound digital transformation
outcomes for both people and organizations.
At our IT conference, Ignite, I talked about how we are innovating in AI across the entire tech stack and how AI will be
infused into everything we do. To accelerate our innovation, we have created a dedicated organization to focus on
artificial intelligence. As I turn to the progress we made by segment this quarter, I'll highlight how these investments
we are make in AI fuel innovation across all of our ambitions. Let's start with productivity and business process.
We are helping people be more productive by bringing intelligence to familiar Office apps they use every day. We
recently introduced cloud-powered intelligence within Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook that uses machine
learning and advanced natural language processing to help automate tasks, Surface-related content and connections,
focus your inbox, and more easily create compelling content.
We're also building intelligence into our apps to provide advanced security for customers. This quarter we announced
Office 365 Threat Intelligence, which analyzes billions of signals across Office, Azure, Windows, and external data
sources to give customers broad visibility into attack trends and proactively recommend security policy adjustments.
We're extending intelligence to compliance with our new data governance service, which helps customers achieve
organizational compliance and automate data retention. These advancements are part of our ongoing commitment to
strengthen security for our Office 365 E5 customers.

We're seeing broad momentum with customers across enterprises, small business, and consumers. Monthly active users
of Office 365 Commercial are now over 85 million, up more than 40% year over year. Office 365 Commercial seats
were also up 40% year over year and revenue up 54% in constant currency. Across industries, customers such as eBay,
European airline easyJet, global pharmaceutical company Allergan, Fortune 100 companies like the energy leader
Exelon and Liberty Mutual Insurance are choosing Office 365 to help make their employees more productive and
secure.
Customers love the power of Office on any device. We now have more than 45 million Outlook monthly active devices
on iOS and Android, a more than 70% increase year over year. Last week we unveiled a new class of purpose-built
intelligent apps in Dynamics 365, designed to remove any impedance that exists between productivity, collaboration,
and business process. Using advanced analytics and machine learning, these new apps glean insights from previously
siloed data to transform how people work across finance, sales, marketing, and customer service. They monitor
customer relationship health, reveal connections, forecast demand, and predict risk. And the deep integration with
Office 365 makes it easy to take action, communicate and collaborate in real time, or schedule a follow-up.
Our innovations in Dynamics 365 build on our existing momentum. Dynamics CRM Online paid seats more than
doubled year over year, and customers increasingly prefer our cloud solutions, with more than 70% of the new
Dynamics CRM and ERP enterprise customers choosing Dynamics Online. Companies like HP, Inc. are replacing their
existing CRM systems with Dynamics 365 to take advantage of the built-in intelligence in our latest release and
transform engagement with customers and partners. Overall, we are well positioned to compete and grow our share in
this large and growing market.
Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Customers continue to choose the
Microsoft Cloud to help transform their businesses and organizations. Our Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run
rate now exceeds $13 billion, and we remain on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018.
Once enterprise customers choose one of our cloud services, they continue to adopt more services. More than 60% of
the Fortune 500 now have at least three of our cloud offerings, up 20 points year over year. And as with last quarter, we
continue to grow our commercial annuity mix, which is now at 88%.
Customers choose Microsoft for three reasons. They want a trusted global hyperscale cloud provider to meet the
enterprise-grade needs. They want hybrid support that is architected into both the hyperscale service and the cloud
servers. They want higher-level services to help them build their own digital capability, inclusive of DevOps
productivity, new IoT and enterprise app development, advanced analytics, and machine learning and AI capability.
These differentiated features are leading our cloud infrastructure growth. Azure revenue once again grew triple-digits,
121% in constant currency, with Azure compute usage more than doubling year over year.
We continue to invest in and expand our data center footprint, which now totals 38 regions, including the
announcement of our planned expansion into France and the recent opening of data centers in the United Kingdom and
Germany. Enterprises like Renault Nissan Alliance, Accor Hotels, as well as public sector customers such as the United
Kingdom Ministry of Defence, the Ireland Health Services Executive, are choosing Azure to transform their
organizations while meeting European data sovereignty, security, and compliance needs.
Security and compliance remain paramount for enterprise customers. Azure is already the most trusted, most compliant
cloud with 49 certifications, more than any other cloud provider. And our U.S. government cloud has the highest
number of certifications and dedicated data center regions in the industry to meet the stringent requirements of our
public sector customers. We are applying AI to security with the new Azure Security Center, which leverages advanced
analytics and machine learning to detect threats and help enterprise customers respond with comprehensive
cyber-security and management.
Looking beyond infrastructure services, across industries customers like Daimler Trucks North America, Uber, and
Lowe's are using Azure's intelligence services to build powerful new offerings for their customers. More than half of
the Fortune 500 have our Enterprise Mobility Services, up more than 20 points year over year. This quarter we released
a premium version of our Enterprise Mobility Service that includes advanced security management for SaaS

applications, automatic document classification and encryption, advanced identity protection. And we crossed 0.75
billion unique user identities in Azure Active Directory.
This quarter we announced a number of key partnerships. Adobe and SAP recognized Azure's leadership in the cloud
and are bringing their industry-leading marketing and human resource solutions to our platform, giving our mutual
customers powerful new ways to transform their business.
Customers and developers are also choosing Azure for its openness. Enabling digital transformation for everyone
means supporting the widest range of platforms, frameworks, and tools. This quarter we announced that we have
open-sourced Windows PowerShell, our industry-leading infrastructure management tool, and made it available on
Linux. We continue to see strong interest in the preview of SQL Server on Linux with 19,000 customers registered,
including more than half of the Fortune 500. It's opening conversations with customers spanning their entire data estate,
both on-premise and in the cloud.
Azure Service Fabric on Linux enables developers to build and manage high-scale micro services and cloud
applications. And we announced that our new FPGA-powered platform in Azure capable of exascale compute will
support Caffe, TensorFlow, Torch, and our own CNTK frameworks for deep learning.
Finally, we are building our server products to become the edge of our cloud to support true hybrid computing. The
new Windows Server 2016 gives IT professionals new layers of security and brings Azure-inspired innovation for
infrastructure and cloud applications. And we extend our
partnership with Docker to make the commercially supported Docker engine available to Windows 2016 customers at
no additional cost.
Now let's talk about More Personal Computing, where we are also seeing intelligence transform Windows 10 and our
ecosystem of devices. We now have more than 400 million monthly active devices on Windows 10 and nearly 200
billion hours of usage. And we are expanding our growth opportunities for Windows with enterprises and in areas such
as gaming.
Last quarter I outlined three aspects of our Windows strategy: first, deliver more value and innovation, particularly for
enterprise customers; second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform; third,
innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me talk through the progress we are making in
each.
This quarter we released Windows 10 Anniversary Update with advanced security features, including Windows
Defender Threat Protection, our cloud-enabled service that helps enterprises detect, investigate, and respond to
advanced network attacks. And with threat intelligence sharing capabilities, we enable IT to investigate and respond to
security threats across Windows 10 and Office 365.
Our advancements in security helped to drive a 3X increase in Windows 10 enterprise deployments over the last six
months. The growth in customer adoption is also driving increased developer, search, and Cortana engagement. The
number of developers building and updating universal Windows apps is up 3X year over year. More than 1,000
applications have been developed using the Cortana API, and Windows 10 Cortana search box now has 141 million
monthly active users, with almost 13 billion questions asked to date.
Gaming is a leading driver of engagement on Windows 10 and opens up new experiences and scenarios across
Windows devices. For the past three consecutive months, Xbox One has been the number one selling console in the
United States, giving us strong momentum heading into the holiday season. Our highly engaged Xbox Live fan base
continues to grow across Windows 10, iOS, and Android, up 21% year over year. And we have more than 20 billion
hours of game play on Windows 10 PCs and tablets, a more than 500% increase year over year. Our commitment to
grow Xbox Live community led us to acquire Beam this quarter, an innovative and interactive live streaming service
that gives viewers the ability to watch and play along with their favorite game in real time.
Finally, let's talk about our progress in new device categories. Surface continues to drive category growth. And more
commercial customers are choosing to deploy Surface, with deals of 500 devices or more increasing 70% year over

year. And we are reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners.
The Windows Holographic platform and Microsoft HoloLens are opening up new differentiated opportunities on
Windows. This quarter we made Microsoft HoloLens Development Edition available to all developers and business
customers in the U.S. and Canada, and last week we expanded our presence to six additional markets. Enterprise
customers like Audi, Volvo, Japan Airlines, and the PGA Tour are all embracing Microsoft HoloLens to transform the
way they work and create new mixed reality experiences for customers. It's still early, but it's great to see the
innovation and creativity that developers are bringing to the platform. And coming in 2017, we will enable our
hardware partners to deliver entirely new mixed reality experiences with Windows Holographic and on Windows 10.
In closing, we are leading digital transformation across all industries and geographies, creating enormous opportunity
for Microsoft and our partners. As we infuse AI into all of our computing platforms and experiences, we will drive
even greater transformational value for our customers. In the coming weeks, I'm looking forward to sharing news about
our new innovation in Windows 10 and Office 365.
Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look
forward to rejoining you after for questions.
Amy E. Hood
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.
This quarter, revenue was $22.3 billion, up 3% and 5% in constant currency. Gross margin was flat and up 2% in
constant currency. Operating income was flat and grew 4% in constant currency. And earnings per share were $0.76,
increasing 9% or 13% in constant currency.
I'm pleased with the strong execution we saw in the first quarter from our sales teams and the partner ecosystem across
both our Commercial and Consumer businesses. Across most markets, our results were in line with macroeconomic
trends, with strength in key markets like the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan.
Momentum in Cloud Services contributed to a total commercial annuity mix of 88%, up two points from the prior year.
We again saw higher than expected transactional deal volume, primarily driven by Office commercial products in our
small and midsize business segment. This quarter, the dollar volume of annuity expirations was significantly larger than
the prior year. And with solid renewals from that base, we grew our commercial bookings by 18%. The larger base also
drove our contracted-not-billed balance to more than $25.5 billion.
Strong execution resulted in better than expected commercial unearned revenue of $22.3 billion or an 8% increase in
constant currency. Our Commercial Cloud revenue run rate exceeded $13 billion this quarter, growing 59%. As I've
shared previously, we expect our Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage to materially improve throughout the
year. This quarter, our Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage was 49%, up seven points sequentially, although we
do expect variability from quarter to quarter. Importantly, gross margin dollars grew by 61% across the total
Commercial Cloud.
Now to company gross margin, our company gross margin was approximately 65%, down a little less than two points
from the prior year, impacted by an increasing mix of Commercial Cloud revenue, slightly offset by improvements in
More Personal Computing. The revenue performance in More Personal Computing largely drove COGS above our
expectations. This quarter, the FX impact on total and segment-level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a
two-point negative impact on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud results and a one-point impact
on More Personal Computing results.
Total operating expenses were flat and grew 1% in constant currency from investments supporting our Commercial
Cloud. At the company level, operating income grew 4% in constant currency. Let's turn to each segment, where we
can now discuss constant currency impact at the revenue and operating income levels. This quarter, our Productivity
and Business Processes segment delivered results above our expectations, with approximately $6.7 billion in revenue,

an increase of 6% and 8% in constant currency.
In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 8% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth continued to
outpace the shift from our on-premise business. We again grew our installed base across all key workloads. In our
Office 365 Commercial business, our premium workload mix was above 60%. As mentioned earlier, our transactional
results were higher than expected in the small and midsize customer segment and benefited from a stabilizing
commercial PC market.
Office Consumer revenue grew 8%, also 8% in constant currency, benefited from a stronger than expected consumer
PC market, subscriber seat growth, and recurring subscription revenue. And our Dynamics business grew 11%, up 13%
in constant currency, as customer preference for our cloud services and CRM Online and Dynamics AX contributed to
billings and seat growth.
Segment gross margin dollars were flat, up 2% in constant currency. Segment gross margin percentage declined an on
increasing cloud revenue mix. Operating expenses grew 2%, also 2% in constant currency, primarily driven by
investments in cloud engineering. Operating income declined slightly but was up 2% in constant currency.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered nearly $6.4 billion in revenue, above our expectations, and grew 8% or 10% in
constant currency. Server products and Cloud Services grew 11% and 13% in constant currency. Demand for our
hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth within server products and Cloud
Services, partially offset by a decline in our transactional on-premise server business. Server premium products grew
double digits in constant currency.
As expected, Enterprise Services revenue growth slowed this quarter to 1% and 2% in constant currency, largely due to
a decreasing volume of support agreements associated with Windows Server 2003 end of support. Gross margin dollars
grew 2% and 4% in constant currency. And segment gross margin percentage declined, primarily due to increasing
cloud revenue mix, partially offset by significant improvement in Azure gross margin.
Given the growth opportunity in cloud, we increased our operating expenses by 21%, also 21% in constant currency, to
fund cloud engineering, sales capacity, and developer engagement. Consequently, operating income declined 14% and
11% in constant currency.
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing; revenue was $9.3 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency,
and better than expected across multiple businesses, first, our OEM results. Our total OEM business was flat this
quarter, more in line with the PC market and better than we expected. OEM Pro revenue grew 1%, reflecting the
stabilizing commercial PC market, particularly in the U.S. OEM non-Pro revenue declined by 1%, slightly ahead of the
consumer PC market, driven by a higher mix of premium devices. Channel inventory levels for OEM Pro and non-Pro
remained at normal levels.
As Satya said, we're seeing strong growth in Windows 10 Enterprise deployments. The annuity portion of our Windows
Commercial business grew again in constant currency, as customers continued to commit to our differentiated security
and management solutions. Overall, our total Windows Commercial business revenue across small and midsize
businesses, enterprises, and academic institutions was flat and grew 2% year over year in constant currency. Patent
licensing revenue increased this quarter, primarily due to favorable results in our annual contractual agreements.
Our Search business grew again this quarter, driven by rate and volume improvements in Bing. Though our growth rate
has moderated, we continued to gain share and scale while delivering profit.
As expected, Devices revenue declined this quarter. Revenue decreased 27%, down 25% in constant currency due to
Phone, where revenue declined 72% and 71% in constant currency. Surface revenue increased 38%, 39% in constant
currency, driven by year-over-year growth for Surface Pro 4 and Book, which launched in Q2 of the prior year.
In Gaming, revenue declined 5% or 4% in constant currency due to lower console hardware revenue. We continue to
see strong engagement on our platform, with monthly active Xbox Live users up 21%.

Our Software and Services revenue from console, PC, and other gaming devices grew 6% or 8% in constant currency.
Segment gross margin dollars declined 1%, up 1% in constant currency, as decreases due to Xbox consoles and Phone
were partially offset by our Search and Surface results.
Segment gross margin percentage improved slightly, given the revenue shift to higher margin products and services.
Operating expenses decreased 13%, also 13% in constant currency, primarily based on reduced Phone spend and lower
marketing spend, resulting in segment operating income growth of 26% and 31% in constant currency.
Now back to our company results; we invested $2.3 billion in capital expenditures, a decline from Q4, but consistent
with our plan for our investment to support customer and partner demand for our commercial and consumer Cloud
Services. During the quarter, we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio, which resulted in other income and
expense of $100 million from net recognized gains on investments and income from dividends and interest, partially
offset by interest expense.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17% this quarter. As I had mentioned before, our income tax rate is impacted by
three factors: the proportion of service revenue versus licensing revenue; the geographic mix of revenue; and the timing
of equity vests. In our first quarter, equity vests impact the rate more significantly than in other quarters.
We returned $6.6 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We also raised our quarterly
dividend by 8% to $0.39.
With that overview of the quarter, let's turn to the outlook. My commentary for the upcoming quarter does not include
LinkedIn. We still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter.
Turning to FX, we expect one point of revenue impact at both the total company and individual segment levels. We
expect our Commercial business to remain healthy. Though we will still see and experience variability in our
transactional business, we will also see strong annuity growth, driven by solid renewal execution and increasing
customer adoption and use of our Cloud Services. Therefore, we expect Commercial unearned revenue to be within the
range of $21.05 billion to $21.25 billion.
Next on CapEx, we'll continue to invest to meet growing demand and see quarterly variability in spend. We expect a
sequential dollar increase in the upcoming quarter. For the full year, our total expected CapEx growth rate should be
lower than FY 2016, given efficiency improvements.
Now let me share some additional thoughts for each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect
revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. We expect the ongoing transition to the cloud to drive installed base growth,
with continuing declines in our transactional business. For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.55
billion to $6.75 billion, driven by strong annuity growth across our server products and Cloud Services. We anticipate
that Enterprise Services revenue will decline due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements.
We expect More Personal Computing revenue to be $11.2 billion to $11.6 billion. This segment is impacted by
different trends than our other two segments, so some additional detail. First on Windows, we expect our OEM
business and the underlying PC market to be closely aligned. As a reminder, in our OEM Pro business, we exited Q2
last year with a slightly higher level of inventory. We currently see normal inventory levels in the channel, which will
dampen year-over-year growth a bit.
In Search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q1. Additionally, we expect that total Search
revenue growth will slow considerably as we pass the one-year anniversary of our Yahoo! deal and the associated
change in revenue recognition. Phone revenue will continue to decline. And as we previously announced, we anticipate
closing the sale of our feature phone business in Q2. We expect Surface revenue to decline as we anniversary the
product launch from a year ago.
And in Gaming, we expect strong share performance in key markets like the U.S. and the UK this holiday, but overall
revenue will decline given lower price points and lower overall console units as mix shifts towards Xbox One and
Xbox One S. We expect continued active engagement growth on our gaming platform given the holiday season.

We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion, with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating
expenses between $7.85 billion and $7.95 billion in Q2, and we remain on path for full-year operating expense of $31.1
billion to $31.4 billion.
We expect other income and expenses to be $150 million, as we continue to balance gains on equity investments and
income from interest and dividends against the interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We continue to expect our
full-year tax rate to be 20% plus or minus two points, with variability due to the three factors discussed earlier.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?

Operator
Certainly, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please
proceed.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thanks, good afternoon. Satya, on Azure, the numbers were really impressive given how hard the
comp was. I'm curious if you could just help out, a little more color in terms of what you saw during the quarter and
maybe how some of the ticket sizes or size of these signs are changing from the past year. Thank you.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Thanks, Brent. Overall, again, I'd go back to how we think about Azure. We really have a view
of distributed computing, which is more expansive than just even our hyperscale cloud. We think about Azure and our
servers as one distributed computing fabric that's building. We also don't think of Office 365 and Dynamics 365 as
independent. We think of them all together building out our Commercial Cloud because [takes] one of the bigger
growth areas we have in Azure, it's IoT. But it's not just people connecting sensors and collecting data. They collect the
data, they store the data, they analyze and do predictions on it. But then after you do predictions, you've got to do
something about the predictions. So in many cases, they choose to use, especially with the new Dynamics 365 Field
Service module automating field service.
So it's those higher-level scenarios that we are seeing in addition to the core infrastructure that supports hybrid that I
think is accelerating. And that's something that obviously we didn't make the decision last quarter to do that. This is a
decision we made many, many years ago. In some sense, the inception of Azure was built for a future which is much
more distributed computing done in a very different way than the client/server era. And I think we're just finally getting
into the early innings of what is true hybrid computing, and it's good to see those in last quarter's results as well.

<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. I want to drill in on Office
365 a little bit. Forty percent growth in commercial seats is a really nice number but even a nicer number on the
revenue line, I think 54% constant currency growth in Office 365 Commercial. That seems to imply you guys are
seeing some nice ASP increase as the platform matures. Can you talk to us about where we are in that cycle of guys
moving from E1 to E3? Is E5 part of the equation? Are you guys actually moving there yet?

<A - Amy E. Hood>: Thanks, Keith. Why don't I take that one? When I talk about the premium services mix in our
Office Commercial 365 business being above 60%, that is what's driving – whether that's the mix shift to E3 or
ultimately to E5. You'll continue to see and have headroom in that number. But you're right, we are encouraged by the
ARPU growth and the value proposition that has customers choosing the premium SKUs and continuing to choose
those premium SKUs over time.
I don't really think about there being a cap on that when you think about the mix percentage because part of it is, as you
note, not just adding the first few nodes in E3, it's continuing to add E5 and new scenarios over time that we'll continue
to create. So hopefully that's helpful, but you are right. It is ARPU driven, the performance outside of the 40% seat
growth.

Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Great, thank you. Satya, I know that Brent asked you about Azure, but I'm just wondering if
you could share with us. You mentioned that compute usage on Azure I think you said more than doubled or nearly
doubled, something to that effect. I'm just wondering if you can share with us how you see PaaS coming along. And
where do you think we are in getting the easier workloads to the cloud, and are you now starting to see the inflection
given we did see an inflection in growth on a year-over-year basis this quarter, where you're starting to see production –
significant production workloads that are on-premise actually starting to move over as well?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Thanks, Heather. We definitely are seeing production workloads that are moving over from
on-premise. But I think the more interesting thing, Heather, for us is to see new workloads. When I look at what's
happening with some of the most innovative work we have done around distributed computing, which is Service
Fabric, and how people are in fact going straight to building out using our PaaS services some of the new hyperscale
Cloud Services using micro services. And not only are they doing that, but we're also seeing great growth in our
server-less infrastructure, which is Azure functions.
So I am actually as excited about new cloud growth from new cloud workloads from the same customers. So the most
interesting thing that I'm observing is that it could be the same auto customer that was participating with us in the
client/server area. We're not just building or moving their IT, but they're building new digital services for hyperscale.
And that's what is probably unique in terms of what has changed year over year for us. It's not just the Silicon Valley
startups anymore. It is the core enterprise that is also becoming a digital company. And we are well positioned to serve
them, and that's good to see.

flow generation in coming quarters as well? Thank you.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Karl, it's actually impacted by the same thing that impacted free cash flow this quarter, which is
about a $1.3 billion unsettled cash – cash settlement impact. So you'll actually see that revert in Q2. Although our free
cash flow growth of 8% in the quarter was actually very good, and I do feel good about that. But I want to make sure
you don't misunderstand the root cause that makes the number a bit of an anomaly.

Our next question comes from line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you and congrats on the quarter. So I want to drill in a little more. The margin for
Commercial Cloud improved 7%, which given the size is a large improvement. Can you give us some more details on
what exactly is driving that margin improvement? And you said it's going be improving over the year, but how
sustainable is that drive to improvement?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Let me start, Mark, and then, Amy, you can add to it. Again, Mark, this goes back to a little bit
of understanding I guess how we think about both CapEx as well as OpEx in terms of our cloud. The architectural
design we have, for example, when we do CapEx, we are buying the equipment for everything that Microsoft does,
which is everything from Azure to Office 365 to Dynamics 365 as well as our consumer services like Xbox Live, and
you see the growth that we talked about across all of this. Then we have a very common platform both for our
first-party workloads as well as our third-party business. And so then as we drive efficiency in our cloud infrastructure,
when we for example use FPGA to get more out of our network, that's efficiency that we gain across the marginal cost
and gross margin that spans everything that we do.
Then also what we think about is the mix. Our goal is not to just sell commodity services but to actually use commodity
services in some cases as a bootstrap for higher-level services because of things like data gravity. So there will be
differences quarter to quarter. We may in fact onboard a few customers who first onboard a lot of storage at commodity
service levels and then later on start consuming some of the higher-level services.
So the margin improvement over a period of time is something that we are absolutely going to see. But for quarter to
quarter, there will be more volatility. But I would ask our investor base to think more about the architecture as well as
the financial outlays of what we are building. We're not just building Azure. We're building Azure, Office 365,
Dynamics 365, as well as our consumer services, which are all cloud oriented. And it's the combination of that that's
driving margin. But, Amy, I'll let you add too.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: I would say in terms of sustainability or quarter to quarter, Satya is right. There is going be
variability. The variability is really two things. One is the pace of the mix shift to Azure. As it grows at the pace we've
seen, it does impact quarter to quarter the overall Commercial Cloud revenue mix. But I would also say the
directionality of the Azure gross margin, for example, which we said significantly improved, we expect to continue
certainly over the course of this year, as we've discussed. So I think the directionality of sustainability is correct. And I
think the variability could certainly occur for many of the reasons Satya talked about.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Great, thanks. I appreciate it.

<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Hi, thanks. Amy, I'm wondering on the segment operating margins, I know you don't
guide those per se, but you have flat performance in operating income in PDP and declines in IC with growth in MPC.
Do you expect to see as we get towards the end of the year that the two Enterprise Cloud segments move positive and
MPC is not as much of a driver? How should we think about the evolution of the product contribution of the three
segments over the year?
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Sure. I'm actually going to cover our Commercial segments as one because really when you
think about the Commercial Cloud, it's really about capturing the opportunity of selling more complete solutions, which
include Dynamics and Office plus some components of Azure, which is I think really the trend you'll see us talk about
from here on out. So what I would say is you will continue to see us focus on gross margin improvement, and we talked
about that. You will also continue to see us invest where we see massive market addressable expansion with sales
capacity as well. So I think we've pivoted dollars to invest in that opportunity. You'll continue to see us do that. But we
also expect revenue growth and gross margin growth to come out of that investment. So I do believe that's a continued
pace you'll see us on. And we feel good about the ROI of the investments we've made, especially in those commercial
segments.
In MPC, I generally expect you'll continue to see improvement through the year just based on the mix of products that
we'll have over the course of the year. That's not new. You saw the same mechanism last year through the year as we
pivot from our Phone business to some of our higher margin products. And so I suspect you'll see a similar pattern and
a similar desire by Satya and I to continue to invest toward growth, especially on the Commercial side.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Mark R. Murphy>: Yes, thank you. I'll add my congratulations. So, Amy, you are reporting an impressive
buildup of the long-term deferred revenue. It's up 162% year over year. At the same time, some of your partners feel
that you are gradually doing away with the three-year EAs that have existed for so long and that you're replacing them
with the MPSA vehicle, which is a little more flexible in terms of length of contract, and there could be some shorter
lengths. Could you help us in terms of how to think through the long-term deferred revenue buildup as you do start to
mix over to the MPSAs?
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Thanks, Mark. Let me break apart that long-term unearned balance a bit. I do really focus, and I
think it's important if you're trying to understand the buildup of our Commercial business to focus only on the unearned
commercial balance. Our overall long-term unearned balance has been impacted by the Windows 10 deferral over the
past bit. And so it can make a bit of a distraction towards seeing the underlying trend.
That being said, our Commercial unearned balance has seen good growth. I'm proud of our performance this quarter,
both sequentially and year over year. And if you think about any change we're making or not in our partner agreements
or customer agreements, we still do generally rely the vast majority on three-year agreements. So whether or not the
term were to change given how we recognize revenue, I would let you know if it was going be material. And I do not
expect the change you're talking about to be material in any way on the Commercial unearned balance.
<Q - Mark R. Murphy>: Great, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats as well, quick question more on an industry
theme for Satya. We obviously saw a very interesting announcement from AWS and VMware, which seems to suggest
that the hybrid cloud is the way forward and both vendors have to react. Can you talk a little bit about your customer
feedback around the hybrid cloud offering from you, and how are your customers thinking about that, working with
you together? Thank you.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Thanks, Raimo. I spoke to this a little earlier because, in some sense, from day one we had this
vision of how we want to build for the future of distributed computing that included our hyperscale cloud service,
which is Azure. And in fact, Azure is built on Hyper-V, and we always said that we were going to build our server at
the edge of our hyperscale cloud, and so that's what Windows Server 2016 represents. That's what SQL Server 2016
represents. And so we have these unique capabilities like being able to stretch even a single table in a database in SQL
2016 all the way to the cloud for having infinite table capacity and then having your apps and queries work.
How we're doing containers, for example, in Windows Server 2016, we have great container support as well as support
for things like our service fabric so that people can have absolute application portability, and in fact people can even
tier applications. We have had many customers who tier their storage and compute across our hybrid backplane. So this
is an architectural design point that we have built for from the ground up from day one. And it's good to see people
validating it now and elsewhere, and we'll take that as a validation of something that we thought of a long time ago.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Raimo. We'll take the next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with BoA Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Hi, thank you very much. Satya, can you just compare and contrast AWS versus Azure, Azure
versus AWS from a standpoint of the technology footprint that you are offering both these companies?
And, Amy, if you could, just comment on the margin structure of your business, the Azure business, relative to AWS.
And if you have time, talk about the Windows 10 cycle. Why is it going to be the best Windows 10 cycle for the
enterprise compared to the previous cycle? Thank you so much.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Kash, I would say, I talked about the reasons, the three big reasons why customers choose our
cloud, not cloud infrastructure in particular. One, it is about the hybrid design point that is at the core of how we are
built, both Azure as well as our servers. It is because of the higher-level services that we have. It is also because of the
design point we have around not just Azure but as well as Dynamics 365 and Office 365 and the extensibility of our
Cloud Services across all three of them. And that's really the fundamental reasons why customers choose us.
The other thing I would mention is we have more of a commitment, I would say, which has been there for a long time,
to build out a global footprint. We have more regions than anyone. We have more certifications than anyone in terms of
adhering to both regulated industry as well as digital sovereignty needs. So we have done unique things. We're the only
public cloud provider, for example, that operates in China. We operate in Germany under German law, and that matters
to multinational companies that also are trying to operate across many geographies and jurisdictions. So those are our
core attributes that are driving our growth, and we'll continue to stay focused on them.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: In terms of the gross margin question, I feel very good. We just talked about this quarter about
our improvement year over year and remain confident that we're heading in the right direction. And so I think when
you think about that plus the breadth of our offerings, I think we're pretty confident.
I will take the opportunity because we haven't been asked about Windows 10 in the enterprise. I think we are
encouraged by the pace of deployment, the number of proof-of-concepts, and actually some of the stability we've seen

Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thank you very much and congrats from me as well. Satya, I actually had a question for you
on SQL Server. As you think about the port to Linux, I wonder if you could provide an update on two things. One is
just the timing of when we should see that in market. And then two, are there other things you need to do to meet that
requirement of across the landscape? So for example, do you have to think about supporting Java runtime inside of
SQL Server, moving a little bit away from the traditional dot-net development environment? So I'm just curious as to
how you're thinking about getting your arms around a wider set of use cases on alternative operating systems. Thanks.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Overall, we are very, very excited about what we are seeing with SQL on Linux because the
entire idea was to be able to have a full conversation around the data estate with customers and to now be able to talk
about the full SQL estate. But one of the other conversations that we are having is not just about SQL but our analytics
and advanced analytics with R, where we have done some very, very compelling work again across Linux and
Windows, and then of course the cloud. So it's really the combination of SQL, advanced analytics, and the cloud with
things like Azure Data Lake that are really the choices customers are trying to make as they think about their digital
capability and the next generation of services and both the storage and processing capability they need.
Now in terms of having support for these different runtimes, you're absolutely right. That's the reason why, for
example, on Azure itself, Java's first class. We have Linux's first class. We have real openness to all of the frameworks
that you can call out to. And that's something that we stay very attuned to, which is we are not trying to fight some old
battles. This is about all being able to serve customers on their needs today, and that's what's leading and driving a lot
of our choices as well as how we think about our market opportunity.

Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Please proceed.
<Q - Gregg Moskowitz>: Okay, thank you very much and congratulations as well. Satya, you're making a much
bigger bet on AI and rightfully so, and you highlighted some very interesting use cases. Having said that, Microsoft has
worked on AI projects for quite some time. So can you help us understand what degree of positive change you think
will come from the combined group that you've recently formed, including when you think material AI benefits will
become truly ingrained in your customers' workflows? And then secondly, how should we think about your incremental
investment in AI going forward?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Overall, I'm thrilled about both the AI group that we have formed, the AI research and the
heritage we have with MSR. Even this week, I think we publicly are talking about setting the state of the art when it
comes to something like speech recognition. And it's something that we did even with ImageNet and image recognition
and object rec. So these are capabilities that are not easy to build if you don't have a real commitment to research and
then the ability to take that research and then ultimately turn it into products.

So the way to measure though from the investment side is to see AI when it's infused into everything we do. Take
HoloLens. The ability of HoloLens to be able to see the world, reconstruct it, and in that world to be able to
superimpose holograms, that's AI, applied AI that's working today. When you have Skype Translate, when two people
are talking two different languages and are able to automatically translate without an interpreter between languages,
he's using a deep neural net that's bringing together speech synthesis, speech recognition, and machine translation with
Skype data, and that's fairly magical. When you see FPGA capable of running CNTK or TensorFlow to create
intelligence, that is what we are using in fact for our speech and vision work. That is AI as applied today.
So I'm not waiting for some future date to see ROI from AI. We are very much going forward. Even the Office Tools
example I used, they're all using AI today. The PowerPoint Designer, if you want the most practical use of it, even I
can design great PowerPoint slides now because of AI. And so that's how I measure progress. We are committed to
long-term research, but we're also very focused on having that long-term research translated into everyday use
products, and that's what you will see from us going forward.

Thank you. And our last question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Brad Reback>: Great, thanks very much. Amy, quick question, with the recent release of Win Server 16, is there
any reason to think we shouldn't see some uptick in the transactional business, especially with the easing comps in the
next couple of quarters? Thanks.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Thanks, Brad. With our annuity mix as high as it is, it can impact it a couple points either way,
but I don't think about that as really a material impact you should think about in the next couple quarters. And our focus
will always be making sure we have a clear roadmap for customers to make long-term commitments through annuity.
And so we are really trying to get away from some of that "launch impact" that you may normally expect to see.
