MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the First Quarter 2011 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kim, and I will be your
operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that
this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations. Mr. Reasor,
you may begin.
Clayton Reasor
Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for your interest in ConocoPhillips. We're here to talk about our first quarter
2011 results. I'm joined today by Jeff Sheets, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning we'll provide a summary of our key financial and operating results for the first quarter, as well as our
outlook for 2011. As in the past, you can find our presentation materials on the Investor Relations section of
ConocoPhillips' website.
Before we get started, I'd like you to take a look at the Safe Harbor statement we've got on Slide 2. And it's just a
reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and the question and answer session.
Actual results may differ materially from what's presented today. And factors that could cause actual results to differ
are included in our filings with the SEC.

Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff to take you through our prepared remarks and presentation.
Jeff W. Sheets
Thanks, Clayton, and good morning to those on the call and those listening in on the web.
I'll start with Slide 2, which highlights some of our first quarter results. Well, during the first quarter, our earnings after
adjustment for special items were $2.6 billion. That's $1.82 a share, which is up from $1.47 a share in the first quarter
of 2010. We had improved financial results this quarter compared to a year ago. However, we experienced more
unscheduled downtime than normal in both our E&P and R&M sectors, and that adversely impacted income by about
$150 million.
Earlier in the quarter, we announced a 20% increase into our dividend, and our board authorized a $10 billion share
repurchase program. And in the quarter, we returned $2.6 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends
and share repurchases. Annualized return on capital was 12% for the quarter, and cash return on capital was 21%. Our
first quarter production was 1.7 million BOE per day, and our global refining capacity was 89% during the first quarter.
During the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $4 billion excluding working capital changes and ended the
quarter with $8.4 billion in cash and short-term investments.
So let's turn to Slide 3 and discuss some of the details of our performance. So total company adjusted earnings were
$2.6 billion, up $426 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. Both E&P and R&M improved earnings from –
over a year ago. Our E&P segment improved $282 million due to higher liquids prices, which were partially offset by
lower production volumes and higher production taxes. Compared to the first quarter last year, our R&M segment
generated $459 million more in earnings this quarter, due primarily to higher refining margins.
Controllable costs were flat for the quarter compared with a year ago. However, variable compensation expenses
related to prior-year performance negatively impacted earnings for the quarter by about $50 million, and that cost was
spread out across the operating segments. This quarter's earnings were also negatively impacted the discontinuation of
equity accounting for LUKOIL. So if you exclude the $385 million impact of LUKOIL earnings in the first quarter of
2010, our adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2011 are around $800 million higher than our earnings in the first
quarter of last year.
So we'll move to the next slide and take a look at production levels for the quarter. First quarter production was 1.7
million BOE per day; that's 126,000 BOE per day lower than the first quarter of last year. Field decline decreased
production this quarter versus last quarter by about 187,000 BOE a day. That's primarily out of the North Sea, the
Lower 48, China, and Alaska. But nearly offsetting this decline was 175,000 BOE per day of production from new
projects, as well as new drilling and improved well performance around our existing production. The increase in
production from projects is primarily from Qatargas 3, Bohai Bay, and the Lower 48 liquids-rich shale plays.
Downtime also adversely impacted our production during the quarter. The 65,000 barrel a day per day reduction is
primarily due to civil unrest in Libya, a several day shutdown of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System in January, a supply
vessel collision with our Britannia platform in the UK, and other downtime in the North Sea. The impact to production
from asset dispositions was 49,000 BOE per day. Nearly all of this is related to the dispositions we did in 2010 in
Canada and the Lower 48. We sold some additional non-operated interest in the Lower 48 in the first quarter, but that
only impacted production by about 2,000 BOE per day. If you looked just at North American natural gas, the reduction
was about 50,000 BOE per day of this total decrease in production.
So if you turn to Slide 5, we can talk about E&P earnings. So E&P adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.2 billion,
which was 15% higher than the same quarter a year ago. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed $519
million of the increased earnings. The earnings improvement was partially offset by a $294 million decrease in after-tax
revenue from lower sales volume. And there was a $57 million benefit from cost and other items during the quarter.

So if you look at the table on the bottom of the slide, you can see that the improved E&P earnings were driven by
international earnings. U.S. adjusted earnings declined compared to the first quarter last year, largely driven by lower
volumes, partially offset by higher liquids prices. Our realized crude oil and NGL prices were higher than in the first
quarter of last year, while realized prices for bitumen and natural gas were flat to slightly lower, the impact of lower
Henry Hub prices being partially offset by higher natural gas prices internationally.
So we'll move to the next slide and talk about E&P metrics. If you look at E&P income per BOE, both income per BOE
and cash contributions per BOE increased, reflecting the improvement in prices for oil and NGL, as well as some
self-help in the form of shifts in our production mix. We continue to shift production away from Lower 48 and
Canadian natural gas, given our view that natural gas prices are going to be pretty subdued in the near to medium term.
And Lower 48 and Canada gas represent a shrinking part of our portfolio. If you look at 2008, it was 28% of our
portfolio. It was 26% in 2010, and 24% in the first quarter of 2011. So full-year 2010 E&P income per BOE was
$10.56. If you look at the first quarter, it was $14.34, so an improvement of $3.80 per BOE. About 10% of this margin
improvement can be explained by the shift in production away from Lower 48 and Canadian natural gas that I just
discussed.
So turning to R&M on Slide 7, our Refining & Marketing adjusted earnings improved significantly over the same
quarter a year ago. Downstream market conditions were stronger in the U.S., and U.S. market cracks improved over
130%, driving a $464 million improvement in margins and other impacts. Volumes were a small benefit in this quarter
compared to the first quarter last year, mainly driven by increased volumes in some of our specialty businesses and in
U.S. marketing.
Our refining capacity utilization of 87% for the quarter was essentially unchanged from the first quarter of last year.
International refining capacity increased to 96%, up from 79% over the same quarter of last year, when we adjust for
the fact that we are no longer operating the Wilhelmshaven refinery. Unplanned downtime cost us about 2% of first
quarter utilization, and the majority of this downtime occurred at our Sweeny and our Borger refineries. Compared to
the first quarter 2010, operating costs were $26 million higher, primarily due to higher maintenance, compensation,
environmental, and turnaround costs, partially offset by some lower utility costs.
As you saw in our press release, we built inventory in R&M in the quarter. Because we're in the market buying crude
for our refineries and selling products, both from our refineries and our upstream assets, we have a strong physicals
position, which allows us to do some profitable trading around these positions by capturing arbitrage and blending
opportunities in the market. Establishing discretionary inventories is a part of that trading operation, and trading
contributed about $50 million to R&M earnings in the first quarter. So the working capital impact that we see from
these discretionary inventory builds will be uses of cash in some quarters, and they'll be sources of cash in other
quarters. But they'll tend to balance out over time.
So we'll take a quick look at our results from our other segments on the next slide. The Chemicals segment posted
record earnings of $193 million in the quarter, up $110 million from a year ago, this increase being driven by higher
margins and lower operating costs. Midstream earnings of $73 million were essentially flat with last year. And
Corporate costs of $300 million were essentially flat with last year as well.
So you move on to Slide 9 and look at cash flow for the quarter. We generated $4 billion in cash from operations this
quarter if you exclude the $2.1 billion increase in working capital. We generated $1.8 billion in cash proceeds from
dispositions. These proceeds included about $1.2 billion from the sale of LUKOIL shares and $600 million from other
asset dispositions. With this cash, we funded $3.1 billion of the capital program, which was $2.9 billion in E&P and
around $200 million in R&M.
As I mentioned earlier, distributions to the shareholders were $2.6 billion for the quarter, which included the repurchase
of 21 million shares at a total cost of $1.64 billion, and $940 million in dividends. We resumed the share repurchase
program in mid-February, following the announcement of our dividend increase and our share repurchase program.
Debt reduction was around $400 million for the quarter. And at the end of the quarter, we had $6.2 billion in cash and
$2.2 billion in short-term investments. And we expect to use the majority of this cash to repurchase ConocoPhillips
shares.

Turning to the next slide, we'll take a look at our capital structure. On this slide, we just give some history of our equity
and our debt levels. Not a lot of change this quarter compared to the end of 2010. Current debt balance is $23.2 billion.
Debt-to-cap ratio right around 25%. As we said previously, we're happy with where our debt balance is, and we'll see it
drift down a little bit over time as we have debt issues mature. We had $400 million of debt mature in the first quarter,
and we see about another $500 million of debt reduction for the balance of the year. But we don't see a need to
substantially reduce the debt balances from where they are today. The debt's long-term. It's low-cost. We have a pre-tax
average cost of this debt of around 5.5%.
So we'll move to the next slide and talk some about the capital efficiency metrics. ROCE and cash returns here that
we're showing now exclude the impact of LUKOIL to our current and our prior periods. So both our ROCE and cash
returns improved in the first quarter, driven by the growth in earnings and cash flow. Capital employed was basically
flat for the quarter. We had a slight increase due to some foreign currency adjustments. Upstream ROCE for the quarter
was 15% compared to 12% in 2010. Downstream ROCE annualized for the quarter was 8% which is compared to 5%
in 2010.
So this completes the review of our first quarter results. And I'll wrap up with some forward-looking comments before
we open the line up for questions. I'll start with some guidance on our downstream business. We expect 2011
turnaround activity to be similar to what we had in 2010. So pre-tax expenses of around $400 million to $450 million.
And this is going to be weighted toward the second half of the year. We expect 2011 global refining capacity utilization
rate to be around 90%. And our total refining capacity now is 2.4 million barrels per day. That's down 2.7 million
barrels per day last year due to the shutting down of the Wilhelmshaven refinery. At our Wood River refinery, we still
expect the new units related to the CORE Project to be up and running in the fourth quarter of this year. As we pointed
out at the analyst presentation, we expect that this project will increase heavy crude capability by about 130,000 barrels
per day, improve our clean product yield by 5%, and increase our realized margins by about $4 a barrel.
So moving to E&P, we've given guidance that we expect 2011 production to be about 1.7 million BOE per day before
impacts related to Libya production or any other additional asset dispositions. Typically our second quarter and our
third quarter production levels are lower than our first and our fourth quarter, due to increased maintenance in the North
Sea and lower production out of Alaska. The events in Libya negatively impacted our production in the first quarter and
will continue to do so at a rate of 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day. But the earnings and cash flow impact associated
with that are around $25 million to $30 million per quarter. Our OECD-focused portfolio is less sensitive to PSC
impacts. A $10 per barrel increase in our oil price impacts our production by about 1,000 to 3,000 barrels per day due
to the PSC impacts.
So last month, the UK proposed a tax legislation, which, if it's enacted in the third quarter of this year as they've talked
about, was going to – which will significantly increase the tax liability to our UK upstream operations. When this law is
enacted, we would expect that we're going to report about a $100 million non-cash charge to earnings due to the
remeasurement of deferred tax liability. They also announced a second tax proposal related to the tax rates applicable to
decommissioning costs. And if that's enacted, that will result in an additional non-cash charge in 2012 from
remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities. And we're currently evaluating the potential impact of that legislation to our
operations.
So moving to exploration. In the North Sea we have two wildcat wells planned for – to test the deep Triassic prospects.
We spud the Peking Duck wildcat in late March and expect to reach target depth late in the second quarter. And we
expect to spud the Pelican wildcat in 2012. Also in the North Sea, we acquired two Norwegian blocks from the Barents
Sea during the first quarter. In the Caspian, the results of the Rak [Rakushechnoe] More discovery are still being
analyzed. And we expect to spud the Nursultan well later this year or early next year. In Poland, we expect that – the
third well in May to further delineate our opportunities in this area. This is the first horizontal delineation well, and it
follows two vertical wells in 2010, which tested the play concept.
We continue to pursue high-quality unconventional opportunities in North America. This quarter we added 33,000
acres in the emerging Wolfcamp shale play in the Midland Basin. We remain encouraged by what we're seeing from
results at Eagle Ford. Early production performance from the wells is better than what we expected. Initial rates are

strong, and the production's not declining as fast as we initially premised. We expect to have 14 rigs operating this play
during the majority of this year. And production from Eagle Ford in the first quarter was 71% liquids. We're also active
in the liquids-rich areas of the Bakken, North Barnett, and Permian, with 10 rigs operating in those areas. We expect to
take that up to 12 rigs during this year. And in addition, we are participating in around a dozen non-operated rigs in
these areas. In all of the Lower 48, our plans are to have twice as many rigs running by year-end than we had running in
the first quarter last year.
So shifting to Australia, APLNG executed a binding sales and purchase agreement with Sinopec for the supply of 4.3
million tons per annum of LNG for 20 years. As part of this agreement, Sinopec is going to become a 15% equity
owner in APLNG. And we are still targeting a midyear final investment decision, at which point we would anticipate
that we'll recognize around a $250 million loss related to our dilution of our interest in APLNG. And we still are in
very active discussions with potential off-takers for the second train volumes.
This was the first full quarter of operations for our QG3 project. The project in general ramped up faster than we
expected, and we're very pleased with the performance of this project.
Our 50-50 joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical, announced that it's advancing a feasibility study to construct a
world-scale ethylene cracker at one of its facilities along the Gulf Coast.
As we had discussed in our analyst presentation last month, we continue to advance our asset disposition program, and
we expect to generate $5 billion to $10 billion of proceeds from asset sales in 2011 and 2012. We had given guidance
previously that we expect these sales to impact production by 50,000 to 100,000 BOE per day and take refining
capacity down from 2.4 million to 1.9 million barrels per day.
So on the share repurchase side, so far this year through yesterday, we've repurchased 32 million shares at a total cost
of $2.5 billion, and we still expect to spend somewhere between $5 billion and $10 billion on share repurchase in 2011.
So that concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And at this time we have a
question from Kate Minyard from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Katherine Minyard>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning.
<Q - Katherine Minyard>: Just a couple of quick questions. First of all on APLNG, what are the milestones that we're
looking for in terms of gas sales agreements that would enable you to reach an FID? And is there any level of gas price
risk that ConocoPhillips would be willing to assume in order to advance the project to that stage?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So we've gotten one train sold now to Sinopec, and we're actively marketing the second train.
As we go through the next few months, we'll be having discussions with our partner about exactly what type of final
investment decisions we'll take, whether we take a one-train FID or a two-train FID, or a one-train with building
infrastructure for the second. Those are all things we'll be discussing with our partner over the next few months as we
continue to market the second train. We can't really say today exactly what type of FID we will take. We're very
optimistic about our ability to sell the second train, though. The market continues to have a good, strong demand for
LNG, both in the near term and the longer term.
As far as whether ConocoPhillips would take a significant gas price risk to market the trains, we don't view that that's
necessary. There is a good strong market out there for sales of LNG from the project.

<Q - Katherine Minyard>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just quickly on CapEx in Lower 48. At current oil prices,
just curious as to whether you'd be looking to increase spending in the Lower 48? And if so, when might we see a
production volume response from that? And I'll go ahead and leave it there. Thanks.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah. So at the analyst presentation, we talked quite a bit about our plans for the Lower 48, and
there's nothing new from what we said about a month ago on Lower 48 capital. So we're continuing to evaluate the
resource plays that we have there for potential incremental investment opportunities. So it's a potential that we could do
incremental CapEx. We haven't made any decision to do that yet. The production guidance that we gave at the analyst
presentation, as far as the rate of increase from the shale plays, is about – is the same as what we had said before. We're
ultimately thinking we're going to get that up to around a 100,000 barrels a day coming out of the Eagle Ford, the
Bakken, and the Barnett. And we think by the end of this year, we're going to be up – what was that? Do you remember
the number there, Clayton? We'll be probably up to 40,000 or 50,000 by the end of this year.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: That's right. Yeah, I think the guidance we've given on Eagle Ford, Bakken, and North Barnett
is around 50,000 barrels a day by year-end.
<Q - Katherine Minyard>: Okay great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: All right.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, Clayton and Jeff.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Jeff, the quality of your E&P portfolio has improved considerably over the last several years
with success you've had on the development side and the divestitures that are – the plan that's under way. And while
your cost and on-schedule performance has been pretty good in the past, it looks likely that it's going to be a little bit
challenged in the future given the number of projects that you have in Asia, specifically in China, Malaysia, and
APLNG. It's a pretty long list. And that's true especially with competitor investment in the region rising. So my
question is how is the company preparing to manage this phase while ensuring that you guys sustain this positive
project delivery record and the returns that you expect in that area?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, so I think the challenges we have are what you outline, it's – well, we're operating in areas
where there's significant other activity. So we're being very aggressive about how we're managing the developments in
Queensland, for example. Working now with our EPC contractor to make sure that we don't run into difficulties there
as we execute those projects. Our heavy oil developments in Canada, we have the same kind of thing. We know that
that's a multi-year development, and we really work to schedule those things out to where that gets done. If you look at
our resource plays in North America, like how we're developing Eagle Ford, we've made sure we had the rig
commitments and the completion commitments in place early as we developed those programs. So, yes, we've got a lot
of things going on in terms of developing our portfolio, and there's always schedule risk, but part of what – we
recognize that going into these projects, and we're putting a lot of effort into managing that, that schedule and cost risk,
upfront.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. And also on E&P, ConocoPhillips took an almost a $5 billion non-cash impairment in
2007 related to the position in Venezuela, which over the past few years has progressed through the legal system and
the ICSID. And so on this point, I wanted to see if we could get an update on the status, the next steps, and the possible
timelines, which I know may be difficult, on that situation.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, sure. It is difficult to predict the timelines, but as we've talked about before, we have filed
– we're working through the arbitration process through the international courts, but we've had our arbitration hearings.
We expect to get a ruling on jurisdiction and the parameters on which values would be calculated later on in this year

and then values as far as the damage calculations subsequent to that. But there's also appeals processes that can be used
even after these rulings are achieved, so we're probably still several years away from -
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: – having a judgment that we can collect on.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacques Rousseau from RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jacques H. Rousseau>: Morning.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Jacques.
<Q - Jacques H. Rousseau>: Just wanted to follow up on the slide you had talking about upstream production
volumes, and specifically I was curious: Of the field decline bar of 187,000 BOE per day, how much of that is oil
versus gas?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I don't have that right off the top of my head. It's a little bit more weighted – if you look at our
portfolio overall, particularly related to North America, the shift is away from natural gas. So the decline in natural gas
in North America is more than the decline in liquids. I think we'd just have to get back to you on a more precise split of
how that declined.
<Q - Jacques H. Rousseau>: Sure.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: But it's a little bit more gas weighted than oil weighted.
<Q - Jacques H. Rousseau>: Okay. And one other question if I could. Regarding Alaska, I know there's been a lot of
discussion about potentially changing some of the tax laws there, and it looks like it may get pushed off in to next year.
And I just wanted to get your views on that.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah. I mean, Alaska has got a very progressive tax regime now, and they're getting to be a
relatively high tax cost area for us. We think that there would be opportunity for increased investment in Alaska that is
adversely impacted by the tax regime up there. So we'll continue to work with the relevant people in the government

Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi, good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: You reiterated your disposal guidance, the $5 billion to $10 billion. I was wondering firstly what
the near-term potential news flow would be out of that program. Secondly, whether the issues in North Africa have
potentially derailed some of the potential disposals. And, thirdly, any news that you might have on refining
restructuring would be gratefully received. Thank you.

<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, I think as we talked about at the analyst presentation, as opposed to what we did in 2010,
where we were fairly specific about guidance on asset sales, we're taking the approach of – we have several things
we're pursuing, but we're not likely to give a lot of guidance about them until transactions are at an announcement
point. So I don't think there's really much more we're going to say other than what we've said so far regarding asset
sales. We've mentioned before that we're continuing to work the Wilhelmshaven refinery asset sales process. We've got
other things we're investigating and working on the downstream side, but it's too early to try to comment on those
specifically. And as far as the events in North Africa, there's not much – there's not really a comment that we can make
there on the impact of that on our asset sales program either.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Thank you. On the pace of the buyback, it was a little bit slower than we expected. Can we
anticipate that to accelerate for the rest of the year?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So with the buyback, we spent $1.6 billion basically in the first quarter. That was starting in
mid-February, after we were out with our dividend and share repurchase announcement. As we talked about a little bit
earlier, we spent basically another $900 million in April. So that'd give you kind of an idea of the pace we've been
going at so far this year, and we'll continue to evaluate that as we go through the year.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Yeah, so it would be an appropriate run rate then?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Good morning, Jeff and Clayton.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Couple of, I guess, a little more granular things from me. Your depreciation in the upstream fell
about $140 million sequentially, and I'm guessing some of that related to the unplanned downtime. But can you just
give us an idea of what's going on there in terms of how we should think about the run rate on a go-forward basis for –
I guess both for upstream and group DD&A? And I have a follow-up, please.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah. So for DD&A, what we guided at the analyst presentation of about $8 billion for 2011 is
still what we would say for guidance. Now, that is lower than DD&A levels in – last year. Part of that's due to lower
volumes. Also part of it's due to a shift in where our production comes from, in that we're having increased production
from equity affiliates, where the DD&A number is essentially part of the equity earnings number and not separate as a
DD&A number. So that is also a significant part of the change. So guidance of $8 billion for DD&A, $7 billion
upstream, $1 billion or so downstream.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it. Thank you. And you kind of read my mind there, because my follow-up was really on the
equity affiliates.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Obviously you don't break out the earnings there, but is Qatar included in there? And can you
maybe just give us an update on how Qatar is performing, because obviously that's been a big part of your incremental
production this year [indiscernible] (33:13).
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yes. Right, yeah. Qatar is in there. And it's performed – as we've mentioned earlier, it's
performed quite well. It ramped up faster than we anticipated, and production's been fairly steady there. So that's been –
the news has been good coming out of Qatar on the QG3 project.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: What are the volumes, Jeff?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: The volumes are about 80,000 BOE a day.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Yeah. That's net.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Net, yeah. Our share was 80,000 BOE per day. Right.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it. Can you give any indication – go ahead. Sorry.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Oh, I'm just saying, just in equity affiliates in general, the big things that go into that, of course,
are Midstream and our Chemicals joint venture. Our two joint ventures with Cenovus on the upstream – the FCCL joint
venture on the upstream, the WRB joint venture on the downstream, and APLNG, as well as the Qatar project.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: And a little bit of Russia.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: And a little bit, right, NMNG, the joint venture in Russia.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. That's terrific. And the last one I have, if I may, is the asset sales on the dollar side, I think
the guidance is pretty clear there. But could you give us just a kind of run rate to date as to what you've completed in
terms of volumes in the upstream and what you still have set to do? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, so the only thing we did that was closed in the first quarter was a relatively small
transaction of some Lower 48 non-operated assets. It was around $300 million, $400 million. The volumes associated
with that are relatively small, kind of 2,000 to 3,000 barrels a day.
You know -
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. So what have you got left to do, Jeff?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Pardon me? What's left to do?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: What have you got left to do?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Well, we've got left to do the rest of the asset sales program we talked about, the whole $5
billion to $10 billion. And kind of like the earlier question, we'll comment more on those things as they occur, as
opposed to identifying specific assets that will be part of this program.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great stuff. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question for you on the refining
downtime in the first quarter. The release seems to suggest there was bit of unplanned downtime, and I was hoping you
could kind of address specifically the regions that's coming from and if that's been corrected heading in to 2Q.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, it's really – it's different places, but predominantly it was at our Borger refinery and at our
Sweeny refinery. So part of the Mid-Continent region, and part of – out of the Gulf Coast region. Both those were
incidents that occurred which caused us to take portions of the refinery down for a period of time, and those things are
both things that have been corrected.
We have unplanned downtime every quarter. First quarter was a little bit higher than what we would normally expect
from unplanned downtime, and we put a number on that of around $50 million impact to R&M for the quarter.

million acres you have there. Have you guys identified the amount of unconventional opportunity, whether it be Avalon
or Bone Springs shale?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: We are working those areas actively, but we haven't fully identified – no, we haven't fully
identified that yet.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rakesh Advani from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Hey, good morning. It's Ed Westlake here.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Hello, Ed. I thought you changed your name.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Yeah, exactly. Hey, just on the Eagle Ford and the Bakken volumes, can you just talk through
how much of that volume already has a pipeline or a rail evacuation route already signed by Conoco, in terms of your
targets?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So our current production is a little over 20,000 barrels a day. We have about 5,000 barrels a
day – wasn't it, Clayton? -that sits, that's curtailed as we're working through evacuation. We have plans in place to cater
for the full Eagle Ford production, which we expect will be up at the 65,000, 70,000 barrel a day by – in a couple years.
So as we go through these next few time periods, there'll be periods where we're a little bit behind on infrastructure. But
we're confident that by the time we get to 2013 and the volumes we think we're going to have there, that we'll have
infrastructure to take that volume away.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And in the short term, that's more rail, and then as pipelines evolve, or – ?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: It's both truck, and it's – I think it's everything. I don't know if we're using rail there. I think it's
primarily truck and pipe.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Right. And then just on a follow on, obviously we had an announcement yesterday from
another pipeline coming from Cushing to Gulf.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: What are your thoughts as a big Mid-Con refiner, as well as the Gulf Coast, that Keystone and
the other EPG pipeline will be on-stream by 2013? Or what are the challenges they face, in your view?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Well, of course Keystone XL faces the continuing permitting challenge to get that done. We
anticipate that that will occur, and that the pipeline will be constructed in the next year and a half or so. We get the
question a lot about whether we should be reversing our Seaway pipeline, which runs from the Gulf Coast to Cushing.
That's something we'll continue to evaluate, but there is a solution planned now between Keystone XL, and the
question's whether there'll be incremental capacity required beyond that. And we, along with a lot of other people, are
studying that question.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: All right. And then my final question on the downstream: You've got better refining margins
in Q2. You'll have your refineries hopefully back up onstream from the unplanned downtime. That's good. But what
sort of negative impact are you seeing at this point from sort of prices impacting demand and on the retail side?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: That's a good question. And we don't have as good a window into that as other companies do,
since we don't operate a retail marketing system. We're a wholesaler for our refined products. So we don't have any
difficulty moving all the refined product that we can produce out of our refineries. So – at market prices. So we haven't

seen any evidence of decreased demand, but I'm not sure that we would be the ones to really see that, since we don't
operate a retail network.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Yeah, for us, I guess it would show up in the gasoline margins that we experience at the

Thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Faisel.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Hey. On the refining side, if I'm looking at the domestic earnings – if you could give us a little
bit of color on the mix of those earnings, did most of that come from the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent? And was the
Northeast profitable this quarter?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, the strongest areas were the Mid-Con refining, with the situation with WTI being what it
is. East Coast refining was still relatively challenged. The West Coast refining margins and Gulf Coast refining margins
were actually stronger as well in the first quarter. So strength in the Midwest, more strength than we've seen recently in
the West Coast, and East Coast was still a more difficult market.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Would you say greater than 50% of your profits came from the Mid-Continent/Gulf Coast
area?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Well, probably so.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Yeah, I'd say that's a fair comment, yeah.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Got you. And then just looking at your bitumen price realizations sequentially fourth
quarter to first quarter, it looks like they were relatively flat for the consolidated company, even though I think the
market prices were higher. If you could just kind of help us understand what's going on there or how are you getting
your guys' bitumen to market, or how are those realizations going to be impacting what's going on today?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, so I think we saw a widening of the differential between bitumen prices and crude oil
prices during the quarter, which is part of what benefits refining as well. There's no change into how we get our
bitumen to market. There's no – we're not constrained by any infrastructure constraints in moving that product to
market. So it was just the shift in differentials which was the primary cause for the relatively flat bitumen prices
compared to the increased crude oil prices.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. So you have no issues getting your product to market? It's just -
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No. Yeah. That's correct.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And then on Qatar, on Qatargas, the LNG volumes, which way were those volumes
flowing during the quarter?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: We don't go into – provide detail on exact destinations of where our Qatari volumes have been
flowing.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Got you. That's it for me. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Thank you. Hey, guys. Good morning.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Jeff or Clayton, on the Seaway, your ownership, the 50%, if your partner wanted to use the
right-of-way to construct another set of pipeline to move from, say, Cushing down to the Gulf Coast, do you guys have
the veto power to veto that or the right to veto that if you want to, or that's not part of your agreement?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I don't know the details of that, Paul. I'd be surprised if they could, since it'd be a right-of-way
that was owned by the company, and we have ability to influence decisions of the company, which owns the
right-of-way. But I don't know the answer to that.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Yeah, I -
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Clayton, is it possible that there's something you can share if you can check and get back to me?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Well, I think it's a question of if there's a commercial aspect of it or there's negotiation that
we're in the middle of, we probably don't want to disclose it. But if it's public out there or part of some pipeline
agreement that's in the public domain, I'd be happy to.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. In your presentation, you indicate that the underlying field decline from the first quarter
last year to the first quarter this year is 187,000 barrels per day or about a little bit over 10% year over year. Is that a
reasonable base operation decline run rate that we should assume, or that there's a number of one-off incidents that
make that number higher than that we should use?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No, I think that's similar to what we've talked about. So that number is just the unmitigated
decline rate. So it's similar to what you heard Ryan Lance and Greg Garland talking about at the analyst presentation in
March. That it's kind of 10%, 11% of our production rate. And then you can do things within those existing fields to
bring that decline rate to more like 5%. And then with new projects, you can – the rest of that decline and have
production growth.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: So that would be the number before maintenance and exploitation capital.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So this is before maintenance and exploitation?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Right, right.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, this is just unmitigated decline.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Right.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And so what is the increase in production, that partial offset in your presentation? Is that
included in your new project at the other column?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yes.

<A - Clayton Reasor>: Correct.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Well, from exploitation work, is what I think – of doing things within existing fields to capture
additional production is included in the Projects, Performance & Other on that production chart.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Jeff, I was looking at that in your cash flow statement you say the working capital is a
use of cash of $2.1 billion. I thought in a rising oil price environment, because you have a longer grace period for the
crude purchase than your accounts receivable, the grace period that you give to your customer, we should see working
capital be a source of funding instead of a use of funds. Am I missing something here?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah. So there's lots of different impacts that are happening with working capital that are price
driven that will balance out over time as things catch up. So what we wanted to point out in the first quarter, though, is
that we consciously chose to increase our inventory levels to facilitate some capturing of some margins in the
marketplace that our commercial trading group had opportunities to do. And that was a big driver of the working
capital change in the first quarter. And that's something that we could reverse if we chose to, and typically we do allow
our inventories to go up and down during the course of the year. So you'll see that that will reverse over time. You
could look at previous years, and you'll see a similar kind of pattern where we'll have usually inventory working capital
negatives early in the year, and working capital positives later in the year.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Yeah. Another source of variance on working capital can also be taxes payable. A couple times
a year we make a big tax payment, and so that number will be – taxes payable obviously is a source of funds, and
there's some variation that comes from that as well in a high-price environment.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Right.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: But the big move this quarter was obviously inventory.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. So this quarter is inventory. It's not the tax, even though it could be a fluctuation factor in
the future?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: That would be hundreds of millions of dollars. I wouldn't be the magnitude that you're seeing
this quarter.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Jeff, any insight that you can share with us on the Ekofisk redevelopment effort, where
we are in the process, what kind of estimated development costs on the actual as well as on the per barrel basis of the
incremental reserve that you will be able to recover, and what are production impacts?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Nothing incremental to what we shared at the analyst presentation just about a month ago. We
do anticipate that sanction of the Ekofisk staff development, Eldfisk 2, will be among the major projects that we
sanction this year. They've got attractive, both F&D and rates of return. And it's going – that over time those are
projects which will cause us to move from having a declining production – well, first they arrest near-term decline in
Norway and ultimately will get Norway production to where it turns around and see some slight increases.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: I don't think the – what'd we say? – $1.5 billion in capital in 2011 for North Sea.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: So sanctions this year, and then capital will ramp up in subsequent years.

<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And final question: There's some rumor on the industry newsletter that the Bohai Bay,
the performance has not been up to their expectation and has been a little bit challenging. Wondering, any comment
you can give?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: There had been one particular platform in Bohai Bay which has been a challenge, but that's been
that way for several quarters now, and that's reflected in the production numbers that you've seen from Bohai.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Right. What's the Bohai current production?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Is it 60?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, I'd have to look. It's probably in our supplemental information. I want to say it's around
50 or 60, but -
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: 50 to 60 net to you, right?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Hang on a second. I think we may actually have that.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: So international [indiscernible] (51:08) actually out of China was 77,000 in the first quarter.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Right. But that's more than just Bohai, also?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: It's mostly – well, yeah, it's Bohai and Panyu as well. I don't know what – off the top of my head
Bohai is. We can probably get -
<A - Clayton Reasor>: 90% of that, I think.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Iain Reid from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Morning, gentlemen.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Morning, Iain.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Got a couple questions about Australia. You're still trying to sell the second train. I wonder if as part
of this negotiation you're also going to sell a similar amount of equity in the development like you sold for Sinopec. So
could we see it potentially being diluted down to below 40% in this development? That's the first question. Maybe I'll
hold on for the second one.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Okay. Yes, we're continuing to sell the second train. The buyers we're talking to, who are the
likely buyers on the second train, will probably want perhaps some equity position. Some of the buyers we're talking to
do not want equity. Some want a small equity position. It would be unlikely that it would be an equity position of the

size that Sinopec came into. So it'd unlikely that we would dilute substantially from where we are today.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Okay. And second question is your partner, Origin, seems reluctant to confirm your costs for the
overall development. Do you have kind of – a harder total development cost going forward from here for the LNG
trains and the upstream development?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So, yeah, I think you're going to get the same answer from us that you're going to get from
Origin, that we're working through that as part of our decision on getting towards a final investment decision in the mid
part of this year, and then we'll be able to give you more information on that once we've gotten to that point.

<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah – no, there's not really an update there. We're still working through getting the permitting
process done there.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: I think as Larry talked about, we were planning – I think it's four appraisal wells around
Poseidon and other discoveries in Browse. I think the permitting is taking longer than we had hoped, so I don't have a
new time to give you right now on when we start the appraisal drilling around that discovery.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Okay. But those wells are actually being – are appraising Poseidon rather than exploration wells on
separate prospects?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: That's correct. These are appraisal wells.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: All right. Thank you, Iain.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Gilman from Benchmark. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: All right, guys. Good morning.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: I had a couple things. I just wanted to go back to that decline rate issue for a sec. Jeff, I thought
you mentioned China both as a source of incremental production as well as a contributor to the decline. Can you clarify
that for me?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So we have decline from -
<A - Clayton Reasor>: From existing.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, so – we did. And we have a decline from existing production in Panyu and Xijiang. Well,
Panyu. Sorry. And then the way we bucket these things is we have different – we have wells and platforms in Bohai
which may be in decline and new things that we're bringing on in Bohai as well. So, yes, I did mention it in both
buckets.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: So Bohai itself all in is in both buckets?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right. But you could see overall production levels from China from the details that we give you
in the International E&P page in the supplement.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Yeah.

<Q - Mark Gilman>: Well, when you talk about – this is just a point of clarification. When you talk about declines at
something like Bohai, that's ex price-related entitlement effects, I assume?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: We don't have large price-related entitlement effects.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: But you do at Bohai.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: We have some, but not – but that is included in our decline numbers.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So the PSC impact would be included in the numbers.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: So in an environment like this, it's being overstated, Clayton, right?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Well, I don't know – it's just – I guess whether or not it's a decline as a result of terms or a
decline as a result of I guess the field life, we don't differentiate those two things.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: In this graph, that's right.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Thanks. Hey, Jeff, regarding this trading-oriented inventory build, were there any LIFO
inventory effects associated with it in your booked downstream earnings, other than the $50 million in trading gains?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Not substantial in this quarter. As we've talked about in previous quarters, exactly how physical
inventory gets marked compared to how paper positions that are hedging trading positions around that inventory get
marked, there can be some noise around that from quarter to quarter. This quarter was not a – no, there were not a
significant number there related to inventory impacts.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Are those barrels in a separate pool?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: You mean outside of R&M?
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Well, sort of as a separate pool within R&M, Clayton. What you're doing in terms of trading
activity.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, we probably could take that discussion offline as far as the complexities around inventory
accounting.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Are you talking about like a different layer?
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Well, not necessarily a different layer, Clayton. I'll take it offline.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Last one from me. I just wanted to try to clarify some of the unconventional liquids
production numbers. Jeff or Clayton, I think a few moments ago, you referenced a 20,000 a day current number. Is that
just Eagle Ford, or is that all of the three unconventional liquids-rich plays?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: That's just Eagle Ford.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: How many wells is producing currently?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Out of Eagle Ford – I don't have that number.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Probably north of 50.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: 50 net wells?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: At least.

<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. If we include the other plays, the Bakken as well as the North Barnett, the current level of
production would be roughly what?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: 50. I think we do about – I think we do, I don't know, somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000
out of the Bakken and probably between 10,000 and 15,000 out of North Barnett.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. And remind me of the year-end objective.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: What do we want to be around? 70,000 – 65,000 to 70,000.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right. 65,000.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: You're talking about those three fields?
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Yeah, those three plays.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, that's what we're talking about.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Guys, thank you very much.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: All right.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Okay, Mark.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Société Générale.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yeah, hi. Following up on Mark's shale question, what was sequential growth fourth quarter to
first quarter for the shale plays, volume-wise?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Well, most of the growth came out of Eagle Ford, and I would say it's probably between 5,000
and 10,000 barrels a day.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. That's great. Any change with Kenai in terms of the shutdown?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: In Kenai?
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yeah. I'm sorry, yes.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Plans for shutdown in Kenai. I think there was additional cargo sold, but I think the issue is
availability of gas.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, I mean, we would – obviously there'd be a market for that gas if we can produce it. But,
yeah, with the decline in the Cook Inlet area, as Clayton says, it's mostly an issue with gas availability and that
compared to domestic demand in the Cook Inlet and Anchorage area.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: So I don't really see any plans to prolong Kenai.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I mean, if we do prolong it, it's just for a short period of time.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, no, that's fine. Last one from me. Regarding the trading that you're doing on the refining
end, how much of a capital commitment is it?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So it is all capital that we can choose to deploy or not deploy in that business. So the inventory
positions that we have can be taken out. So it's not a long-term capital commitment in that business.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: I was just trying to figure out how much you're swinging, that's all.

<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, so the swing in the first quarter was $2 billion in the downstream part of our business.
And that's a mix of inventories, payables, receivables, all those kinds of working capital impacts. That's a fairly large
swing for a particular quarter. If you look historically, we've probably been more to the $1 billion, $1.5 billion swings
in working capital in a quarter.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Hi, guys. Just two quick ones. One on Libya. I realize visibility there is pretty negligible. But
do you have a sense of just the physical state of your assets in terms of damage, et cetera?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No, we do not. Yeah, we don't have a good – we don't know production levels, physical state of
the assets. Really we don't have good information coming out of Libya.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: We got our employees out – was it mid-February?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah. Really before everything happened there.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: We really don't know.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay, no. Completely understood. And then if I can get a quick update on your program in
Poland.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Not much more to say than what we talked about as we were going through the presentation.
We've drilled a couple of wells there, vertical wells. We're moving now to drill a horizontal well, and we'll continue to
just evaluate that program as we move forward. Not a lot more we can say about it at this time.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Very good. We'll try back in a couple months. Thanks.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Hernán Ladeuix from CLSA.
<Q - Hernán Ladeuix>: Good morning. I have a question on the international refining side. Results on realized
margins went down quite sharply quarter on quarter, when market indicators have gone up. What would be the main
reason for that?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: You're asking why international – well, I'm not sure -
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, so maybe in which segment again?
<A - Clayton Reasor>: He did say international refining.
<Q - Hernán Ladeuix>: International refining. Basically, margins went down 50%.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: International refining.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Let's see. So our international refining, if you think about it, it is fairly limited. It's the Humber
refinery in the UK, the Melaka refinery in Malaysia, and then we have a joint-venture refinery in Germany. Humber did
well, but I'm not sure market indicators – you're saying market indicators were higher in -
<Q - Hernán Ladeuix>: Yeah, it went up.

<A - Clayton Reasor>: In European – ?
<Q - Hernán Ladeuix>: Singapore went up, Europe a little bit up. But your realized margin went down by 30% or
more.
<A - Clayton Reasor>: Yeah. I don't have a good answer on that.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, we'd have to get back to you on that one.
<Q - Hernán Ladeuix>: We can talk later.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I expect it has to do primarily with changes in co-product pricing, which are not part of the
market indicators.
<Q - Hernán Ladeuix>: Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.
