Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan fourth quarter and full year 2015
earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing

Brenton L. Saunders
Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you to review our results for the fourth quarter and
full year of 2015. It has been a very exciting and successful 2015 for Allegan as we continue to transform our business
into a Growth Pharma leader.
Allergan's fourth quarter and full year performance reflects a continued laser focus on executing on the four pillars of
our growth strategy. First, operational excellence. We powered another quarter of exceptional financial performance
while successfully integrating Forest and Allergan. With the planned divestiture of our generics business to Teva, we
are accelerating our transformation into a Growth Pharma leader.
Second, our focus on therapeutic area leadership has led to strong growing branded franchises with new product
launches serving as a growth accelerator.
Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine continues to produce at a record pace. In 2015, we delivered four
branded NME FDA approvals. That is nearly 10% of all such approvals by the agency in 2015. With more than 70 midto
late-stage programs in development, our branded pipeline is poised to continue to delivering innovative products for
patients across our key therapeutic areas.
Our best-in-class generics R&D engine also finished the year strong with 46 new ANDAs filed including 22 first-to-file
applications. And we're continuing to execute on strategic business development opportunities.
Our Open Science model has helped us build or expand number one or two positions in many of our key therapeutic
areas and has delivered significant R&D assets to build a sustainable pipeline. With our proposed combination with
Pfizer, we are positioned to create the leading global biopharmaceutical company in the world.
Turning to slide six, this year was highly transformative for Allergan with the announced divestiture of our Global
Generics business to Teva. We continue to make great progress in our planning efforts and Teva continues to make
progress with regulatory authorities. We're working towards satisfying all conditions in order to close by the end of the
first quarter 2016; however, it is possible that closing could slip beyond the end of the first quarter. I'm very proud of
the tremendous focus and execution of our Global Generics team and we look forward to the combination of our two
great generics businesses.
Slide seven. Now, let me turn to the continuing operations business performance in fourth quarter. Our fourth-quarter
net revenue grew 74% on a year-over-year basis to $4.2 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition and strong global
growth within all of our key therapeutic categories. Strong sales in key products across our businesses drove a 33%

increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.41. Meanwhile, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA rose to $2 billion, an
increase of 115% versus prior year, and cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion excluding R&D asset acquisitions,
restructuring and integration payments. These results illustrate the strong long-term growth profile of Allergan and our
Growth Pharma model.
Our team continues to drive strong performance. Five of our seven franchises have now reached the $1 billion mark.
We maintained or expanded our leadership position in all of our key therapeutic categories. And when you exclude the
impact of foreign exchange and Namenda IR, all of our therapeutic area businesses delivered double-digit growth.
Slide nine, our branded revenues grew double digits for the year and growth was broad-based across our key
therapeutic areas. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, three quarters of our top global products grew at
double-digit rates. Nine of our top global products grew more than 15%. Leading growth drivers included RESTASIS
plus 19%; fillers, plus 20%; BOTOX, plus 14%; LINZESS, plus 55%; VIIBRYD, plus 26%; and Lo Loestrin, plus
26%.
We continue to solidify our leadership in key categories with strong execution on new launches. Our recent launch of
VIBERZI for the treatment of IBS-D is off to a strong and early start and is in line with our previous launch of
LINZESS in IBS-C and anti-infectives are launches of AVYCAZ and DALVANCE have delivered strong results
throughout the year and outpacing competition with an impressive launch trajectory. The launch of LILETTA, our IUD
earlier this year has been very successful, shown continued growth momentum in unit sales. VOLUMA, a key driver
within our fillers line in the U.S. continues to drive strong growth for our Allergan Medical business.
Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth through new approvals and upcoming launches including VRAYLAR
in the first quarter of 2016.
Touching on our international business, our teams delivered continued double-digit revenue growth from key products
including BOTOX therapeutic, OZURDEX and our glaucoma business. Our international eye care team led an
exceptional rollout of OZURDEX in new countries with new indications, driving a 35% growth rate for that product
year-over-year. In addition, our international team launched several key products in 2015 including JUVÉDERM in
China and we gained rights to CONSTELLA in more than 40 markets, which adds another growth driver for this
business in 2016.
Turning to slide 11, as noted earlier, we have made tremendous R&D progress this year. Our Open Science model
seeks to deliver innovation regardless of its source. We have utilized this model to acquire or in-license innovative
products that expand our therapeutic area leadership and 2015 was a year of impressive productivity on this front.
In eye care, we continue to add [indiscernible] (08:56) development opportunities for dry eye disease and glaucoma
with the acquisitions of Oculeve, Mimetogen and AqueSys.
In aesthetics, we completed the acquisition of Kythera, adding KYBELLA, a non-surgical treatment for submental
fullness or double chin. We also acquired Northwood Medical Innovation and its less-invasive surgery sparing product,
earFold, as well as Anterios and its proprietary NDS platform delivery technology that could enable local targeted
delivery of neurotoxins to the skin without the need for injections.
In CNS, we completed the acquisition of Naurex which added rapastinel, a breakthrough designated treatment in the
development for depression and other potential breakthrough treatments in depression. We also in-licensed the right to
Merck's development stage oral CGRP programs for the potential treatment of migraines, which we expect to enter
Phase 3 later this year. And late in the fourth quarter, we announced our collaboration with Rugen Therapeutics to
support the discovery and development of novel therapies for autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive
disorders.
And in GI, we acquired commercial rights to CONSTELLA in key international markets. This adds an important
flagship product for our international GI commercial team and positions us strongly for the potential introduction of
eluxadoline in international markets later this year.

Turning to slide 12, a key driver of future growth is new launches in 2016 and beyond. Both in the U.S. and
internationally, we are poised to deliver sustainable growth through a number of new launches across five different
therapeutic categories in 2006 (sic) [2016] and early 2017. We will add important new products in the U.S. including
VRAYLAR, multi-dose preservative-free RESTASIS, a new BOTOX indication, ACZONE 7.5%, XEN [ph] Shunt
(10:59) for glaucoma, Oculeve for dry eye, and new fillers including VOLBELLA and VOLIFT.
Internationally, we will drive growth through new products including XEN [ph] Shunt (11:10) for glaucoma, OPTIVE
Gel Drops in the EU, KYBELLA also known as BELKYRA in Canada and Australia, and VOLITE in the EU later in
2017. With more than 70 projects in mid- to late-stage development, we have multiple programs in each of our leading
therapeutic areas that help us to sustain strong future growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Nicholson who will provide a more detailed pipeline update. David?
C. David Nicholson
Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. On slide 14, as you've seen as mentioned by Brent, Allergan's R&D team has
had a highly productive year, with more than 100 pharma regulatory approvals worldwide. These strong results
included submissions of our multi-dose preservative-free formulation of RESTASIS and then Nebivolol/Valsartan
fixed-dose combination in the United States.
We have 25 major drug approvals globally, including LILETTA, VIBERZI, KYBELLA and VRAYLAR in the United
States and DALVANCE in the EU. We had 12 major device approvals, including VOLITE in the EU and JUVÉDERM
in China.
45 NMEs were approved in the U.S.A. last year. Allergan compounds – VRAYLAR, VIBERZI, KYBELLA and
AVYCAZ – accounted for nearly 10% of these approvals. This was a truly remarkable year to Allergan's R&D team
and I applaud them for their hard work and tremendous success.
I do want to take a moment to recognize my colleague, Hafrun Fridriksdottir, who heads up the generics R&D. The
team's achievements continue to set the industry standard, with 46 new ANDA filed which included 22 first-to-file
applications. Outside the U.S., they filed more than 1,000 marketing applications for key products in key markets
around the world.
On slide 15, I look forward into 2016. Allergan's R&D team is poised for another productive year. We expect more
than a dozen approvals and regulatory submissions. I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I do want to
go through a few key highlights. The Medical Aesthetics, we expect U.S. approval of ACZONE 7.5% in the first half
of the year and VOLBELLA for lips in the second half. We anticipate international approvals for BOTOX in crow feet
lines and VOLUMA XC in Japan. We're looking forward to the approval of KYBELLA or BELKYRA as it is known
outside of the U.S. in the EU in the second half of 2016.
New applications for oxymetazoline in rosacea and BOTOX for forehead lines are expected to be filed with the U.S.
FDA in the first and second half of this year, respectively.
Moving on to eye care, we are expecting U.S. approvals of a multi-dose preservative-free formulation of RESTASIS in
the second half of 2016. We also expect to file 510k submissions for XEN45, our ocular stent to treat glaucoma and the
Oculeve TEARBUD, which is an intranasal neurostimulatory device for dry eye in the second half of 2016. We are
anticipating the Phase 3 enrollment of our Bimatoprost SR will be completed by the early 2017 timeframe.
In Gastroenterology, we expect a second half 2016 EU approval for eluxadoline for the treatment of IBS-D. We're also
preparing sNDA submission for low dose LINZESS 72 microgram for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation
for the first half of 2016. And we're looking forward to seeing the Phase 2b data for Relamorelin, our investigational
treatment for diabetic gastroparesis, in the second half of 2016, which we're working on with Rhythm Health.
In women's health, we expect to have top line results from the first Phase 3 study of Esmya in the first half of 2016. In
CNS, we expect to submit an NDA for Semprana in the U.S. This is an investigational treatment for acute migraine in

the second half of the year. We expect to begin new trials for some of our mid-stage compounds. This includes
initiation of a Phase III study of Cariprazine in bipolar depression. Importantly, Phase 3 studies for Rapastinel, an
investigational [ph] late (17:16) treatment for major depressive disorder and Ubrogepant, a potential treatment for acute
migraine are expected to begin in the second half of 2016. Know that Rapastinel obtained breakthrough designation
from the FDA.
And finally, in anti-infectives, urology, and cardiovascular, we anticipate receiving FDA approval for
Nebivolol/Valtarsan Fixed-Dose Combination treatment for hypertension in the first half of 2016. We have submitted
and the FDA has accepted our sNDA submission for chronic intra-abdominal infections for AVYCAZ and we are
planning a further sNDA submission utilizing Phase 3 data for complicated urinary tract infections in the second half of
2016.
As I have outlined, we did have an extraordinary 2015. And we are expecting an equally exciting 2016 for our brand's
R&D pipeline. I really thank our more than 2,000 Allergan employees, R&D colleagues around the world for their
tremendous work and dedication in achieving these results.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tessa to review our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Tessa?
Maria Teresa Hilado
Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 17 provides overall results for the fourth quarter and full year
2015. Please note, this discussion of results reflect continuing operations only, which we began reporting since the third
quarter of 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.
In the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver exceptional year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis,
consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 74% versus fourth quarter 2014. This
increase was primarily driven by strong performance in our BOTOX, eye care, medical aesthetics, and GI businesses
offset by the loss of exclusivity for Namenda IR. On a non-GAAP gross margin basis for the fourth quarter, it was
78.1%, an increase of 12.1 percentage points versus fourth quarter 2014, which reflects the addition of the Allergan
business.
Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $338 million compared to $203 million in the prior year period.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.9%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points versus the prior-year
quarter as a result of the launch of KYBELLA, sales force expansion within our facial aesthetics franchise in the U.S.,
and transactional FX impact of approximately $30 million.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.98 billion, an increase of 115% versus the prior year, driven by strong
revenues and higher gross margins across our business segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter
increased 33% to $3.41 per share compared to $2.57 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our non-GAAP tax
rate was 8.2% in the quarter. This rate was driven primarily by the entire interest expense being included in our
continuing operations earnings. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion impacted by recent
R&D acquisitions. Excluding the impact of restructuring and onetime items, cash flows were strong at $1.8 billion.
Turning now to our U.S. Brand results on slide 18. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year. U.S.
Brands revenue was $2.5 billion for the quarter, up 38% versus the prior-year period, driven by the addition of the
Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products in the GI and women's health franchises, offset by a decline
in Namenda IR with the loss of exclusivity for that product. Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands continued to be
strong with margins of approximately 87.8%, up 7.1 percentage points versus the prior-year quarter. SG&A as a
percentage of revenue decreased to 18.2% versus 21.2% in the year-ago quarter driven by our continued ability to
maximize our commercial infrastructure and continued synergy capture from recent acquisitions.
Turning to slide 19 in our U.S. Medical business. Fourth quarter revenues were $490 million, an increase of 7% versus
the prior quarter. There are no prior-year comparisons for U.S. Medical as it was acquired as part of the Allergan
acquisition in March of 2015. On a pro-forma basis, the U.S. Medical business grew 9.3%, reflecting strong growth in

BOTOX, fillers, and breast implants. Our breast implant business had its best quarter to-date, driven by the launch of
Inspira and market share expansion as we were able to capitalize on a competitor being out of the marketplace. Fourth
quarter gross margins continued to be strong at 93.4%, and SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 23.3% due
to additional KYBELLA promotional spend and sales force expansion related to the launch of that product.
Turning to slide 20 in our International Brand results. Fourth quarter revenues were $691 million versus $79 million in
the prior-year period largely due to Allergan acquisition. Excluding foreign exchange on a pro-forma basis,
international revenues in the fourth quarter grew 12%, driven by continued strong growth of OZURDEX, BOTOX
cosmetic, and fillers. Gross margins were 83.7% in the fourth quarter. Segment SG&A increased 1.6 percentage points
to 31.4% versus third quarter 2015 due largely to new product expansion for BOTOX and fillers.
Turning to our Anda business on slide 21, revenues decreased 5% to $547 million versus $576 million in the prior
quarter, driven by lower retail business primarily from the Target merger with CVS, which had some impact on the
fourth quarter. The impact in 2016 revenue will be more significant in the range of $500 million; however, we expect
margins to remain stable. Results in all periods include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products
manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda.
Slide 22 details our debt capitalization. We ended the fourth quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.7 billion
and equity of $76.6 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. At year-end, our leverage ratio
was 4.09 times debt to pro-forma adjusted EBITDA versus 3.98 times in the prior quarter. Since year-end, we have
repaid approximately $500 million of term loan debt and $200 million toward our revolving credit facility.
We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings. Following the close of the divestiture of our
generics business to Teva, we anticipate making a debt repayment toward the remaining term loan balance of
approximately $8 billion. The remaining proceeds will be reflected on the balance sheet until the Pfizer close.
Let me close with a few comments on our preliminary view of 2016 financials. Please note that this guidance will
remain in effect until prior to the filing of the EU prospectus to be filed by Allergan in connection with the Pfizer
transaction subsequent to the U.S. filing. We expect full year net revenues to be approximately $17 billion, including
branded business revenues of approximately $15 billion. Our revenue forecast reflects foreign currency headwinds of
approximately $200 million and lower year-over-year revenue expectations for Anda of approximately $500 million
due to the merger between Target and CVS.
In our branded business, excluding Namenda IR and divestitures, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth
driven by strong sales of key products and new launches in 2016. Note that revenues will be back-half weighted as a
result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. As a result, the
first quarter of 2016 will be lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and will be the lowest quarter of the year with each
quarter subsequently increasing. Our gross margin should remain strong with no material change from current levels.
Because of the initiation of the pre-integration planning process with Pfizer, we will no longer proceed with our plan
for a restructuring following the divestiture of the generics business. As a result, SG&A as a percentage of non-GAAP
revenue is now anticipated to trend above our previous expectations of 21% to 24% to approximately 25% of total net
revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue will be higher in the first quarter and then trend downward throughout the
year as we support a number of important launches this year, including KYBELLA, VIBERZI, and VRAYLAR. R&D
spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion reflecting increased investment from 2015. The increase is almost
entirely project-related as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing our pipeline. Our tax rate
should begin to trend toward normalized levels in the range of 14% following the close of Teva.
And now, I will turn the call back over to Brent for an update on the Pfizer transaction. Brent?
Brenton L. Saunders
Thank you, Tessa. Before we start the Q&A, I wanted to provide a brief update on our proposed combination with
Pfizer. In late-November, we announced with Pfizer the proposed combination of our businesses, bringing together two

successful pharmaceutical companies to create a premier global biopharmaceutical leader with the resources and
capabilities to bring more medicines to more people around the world.
Together, we will leverage the best of both organizations, matching Pfizer's strong infrastructure, broad portfolio, and
global reach with Allergan's operating agility, growth profile, and new therapeutic areas. We will have breadth and
depth in key therapeutic areas strengthened by an expanded global footprint, allowing Allergan brands to reach more
patients and more markets more quickly, including two of the world's largest pharmaceutical markets in Japan and
China.
We will have an innovative R&D pipeline consisting of projects sourced from strong internal science and Open Science
to fuel our future growth. We are two months into the planning for this combination, and I'm already pleased to see
early progress on our integration planning efforts such as the announcement of our proposed executive team. Both
teams are hard at work planning for the integration for what will be the premier biopharmaceutical company in the
world. We continue to expect the combination with Pfizer to close in the second half of 2016.
With that, I'll turn it back to Lisa and we'll open it up for Q&A.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Operator, I think we can get started on the Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great. Thanks very much, and congratulations on the fourth quarter performance. I have a
couple questions, please. The first is, Brent, could you just talk at a high level about the outlook for the global
aesthetics business in the face of potentially slowing economies ex-U.S.? And then maybe within that answer, you
could also comment on the BOTOX revenue outlook for 2016 and whether you expect the aesthetics portion of the
BOTOX franchise to grow faster or slower than the medical indications? And then just finally, a quick minor question
on Anda. You mentioned that the Target-CVS merger impacted Anda. Could you just provide a few more comments on
that? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. Thanks, David. Yeah, so I think turning to the global aesthetics business, I think
we feel good about the business. I think when you look at history and even go to the Great Recession, the durability of
that business I think was tested and it was proven that even in slowing economic times, people still look to elective
procedures, particularly non-invasive procedures over surgery. So, we tended to do well and remained strong even in
the Great Recession. So, we're very optimistic despite any slowing economic factors around the world for the aesthetic
business.
With respect to BOTOX, perhaps Tessa can jump in, but we believe both the aesthetic application and the therapeutic
indications are going to drive strong growth not only from expanding markets in the U.S. and abroad, but also
expanding indications across both of the uses. We continue to – as David outlined, we continue to look for new
indications, for example, crow's feet, outside the U.S. and we continue to study BOTOX scenarios like depression. And
so, we think BOTOX still has a decade or more of strong growth ahead.
Tessa, do you want to touch on those numbers?
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yeah. For both medical aesthetics and therapeutic, both are actually growing at a very

<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Great. And then I think with respect to Anda, I don't know if Bob Stewart wants to jump
in, I think when CVS bought the Target pharmacies, we fully anticipated that CVS – the main reason they bought the
Target pharmacies outside of having their brand inside of Target or their capabilities inside of Target, was to save on
some of the leverage, some of their distribution capabilities. So, we knew that was coming. It was a very low margin
business for us anyway, and so it doesn't impact in any substantial way our profitability, but it does impact revenue.
And so, you're just going to see that full-year effect flow through in 2016.
Bob, any other comments on that?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: No, I think you said it there, Brent. Really, what we were doing within Anda is offering
different services to what we considered our key customers. Target was one of those. And what we offered them was a
virtual warehouse capability that basically moved product through Anda, but at a very, very low margin. And so, what
you saw here is the effect of that business moving back to CVS. And there's a top line impact, but in terms of bottom
line impact, it's negligible.

Your next question comes from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Good morning, everyone. Just a question, Brent. Is it possible you could provide us some
nuance on the regulatory process both for Teva and Pfizer that we might not appreciate in terms of either how well it's
going or maybe some of the difficulties? And then also, not sure if you'd be willing to do this, but could you give us a
perspective on the discount that we're observing between your price and Pfizer? Clearly a lot of fear, is there anything
you can just help contextualize that could provide some perspective around that? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, sure, Ken. I think with respect to the Teva transaction, I think the teams have been
working incredibly hard. It's a very complex regulatory filing around the world and requires every individual product
and overlapping product to be analyzed by the regulators. So, I think given the sheer volume of products there, we
should be a little understanding of the time that it takes. We still, as I said earlier, believe it should close close to the
end of this quarter or slip a little bit into the second quarter, but nothing really surprising or concerning on our end. I
think it's just a matter of managing complexity and the time line, and I have to give our legal team but also the team at
Teva a lot of kudos. They're managing through complexity with amazing grace. So, I give them a lot of kudos for that.
And I wouldn't stress too much about that, it's just running its normal but complicated course.
On the Pfizer situation, everything's moving ahead. All the filings are being contemplated or in process and we do
expect that to close in the second half. And we haven't stumbled across any surprising or information that we thought
was different than when we originally contemplated the deal. So, I would say absolutely where we thought it was going
to be and moving ahead full steam.
I think with respect to the spread or the discount, it's a little baffling from my perspective and I know from Ian Read's
perspective. I think if you look at buying us, you look at Pfizer, you're buying Pfizer like in the [ph] low $20s. (36:51) I
haven't done the math recently, but it's a fairly significant discount, I think 20-plus percent. And my guess is there's just
some skepticism around could the government do something to intervene. All of our knowledge and sources at both our
side and Pfizer's is that this deal will close. It was highly – it was constructed in a highly legal way with advice of many
experts, and I think we're in a very strong position to close this deal in the second half of the year. [ph] I don't see
(37:27) any obstacles.

Your next question comes from Randy Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks. Just a couple questions, Brent. The key metric this morning really is the
10% plus growth in the branded business. So, can you just characterize for us any changes or lack of changes in how
you're thinking about the price-volume outlook there? And then a second one for Bill, maybe can you just talk a little
bit more about the VIBERZI launch. Should we be thinking about the LINZESS trajectory as the right analog for that
opportunity? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, so I'll make an opening remark and then turn it over to Bill. I think with respect to
price-volume, nothing in our behavior has changed. Obviously, we've watched the outside environment and a lot of the
rhetoric around pricing. But I think we have had a long history, and if you go back and look at things that I have said on
this topic dating to back to Forest Labs even, we always treated our payer colleagues as customers. And we're always –
we're mindful of the respect that you need in that relationship. And so, we were always, with some exception for
mispriced products but for the large majority of our products, we were always very respectful of the price-volume
relationship. And so, we see it as business as usual. It is always a negotiated relationship.
For those people who think we can just take price increases as we deem fit, that is not true. There is always a
repercussion to doing that and they're always highly negotiated. We don't see – the pressure was there last year, it was
there the year before, and it's there again this year and it's something that innovation and good data and good customer
service tend to help balance on our end. And so, I know there's a lot of rhetoric but we don't see any impact on our
business or and change in the foreseeable future.
With that, I will turn it to Bill.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. First on the pricing point, I agree with Brent, generally our aim here especially for our
top products is real estate and market share and volume. We have exclusivity periods on most products that extend well
into 2020 and our pricing approach reflects that. The price-volume relationship on our top 10 products leaned heavily
towards volume in 2015, we expect the same in 2016, and our price increases generally trade for our growth products
below 10%. And as Brent said, we have excellent formulary coverage and that's given the relationships that we have
with health plans.
As it relates to VIBERZI the price-volume relationship is – or equation is a little different relative to LINZESS. I think
a good way to think about it, the trajectory will look like the IBS-C component of LINZESS, which is about 50% of the
volume in terms of pricing, of course, the price point is public, VIBERZI in the, let's call it, $15 to $20 a day range
relative to LINZESS, which is probably like $7.00 or $8.00 a day. There's a big primary care and GI detailing effort,
direct-to-consumer advertising will start in March. And based on the first six to seven weeks of data, this feels very
much like LINZESS. The pharmacology of the product is very intuitive to physicians, it's got a good benefit risk ratio.
And so, I think it can be – it could double the size of our GI business over time.

Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. I know that the focus of the call today is not on the Generic business, but I was
wondering if you could share with us anything that you are seeing that might constitute a change in pricing dynamics.
Obviously, we've seen generic drug price deflation over the last couple of quarters after a period of inflation. Is this
what you're seeing there? And then lastly, Brent, what's driving the $1.5 billion in R&D spend in 2016? Thanks very
much.

<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So, let's talk about generics first and this will just give me the ability to just make a
quick comment before I turn it over to Bob Stewart about the Generic performance. Given the disruption in the
pre-integration period with Teva and the complication – the divestiture of a business is a lot harder than integrating an
acquisition. Our folks just have continued to have impressive performance despite all the additional work they've had to
do regarding the Teva pre-integration process. So, something that I just have been very proud of that team for.
And maybe, Bob, you could talk about the environment. I think Paul Bisaro is on as well, so maybe he'll chime in as
well.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Yeah. Hi, Jami. It's Bob here. So, with respect to the pricing environment, I don't see a lot
of change between what we saw in 2015 versus 2016. I mean, there's no question about it with the purchasing
consolidation and the buying now and fewer hands. There's no doubt that there's challenges to that remaining status quo
going forward. But I think what you're seeing now in the way that companies are reporting, some are reporting higher
price erosion versus others and I think that's largely due to the strategies that they're employing. Some companies are
really trying to fill their capacity and chasing share and usually when you're chasing share, you're basically discounting
your products in order to be able to get that volume benefit.
And so that wasn't our strategy nor was that the same strategy from others and what we've been focusing on over the
years is making sure that we've got the right capacity and differentiating ourselves with the portfolio. And those
companies that have differentiated portfolios that are harder to manufacture, less competition and products generally
see price erosion on the lower end of the range. And so, what I'd see in our business and Brent alluded to the fact that
our business has performed very well despite obviously going through this integration, what we're seeing is that price
erosion kind of consistent with 2015 which we saw that in more the mid-single digits and I see that continuing in 2016
as well.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Paul, anything you want to add?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, I agree with Bob. I would only add one thing, I think Teva is going to be well-positioned
to deal with these market dynamics for 2016, 2017, and 2018 given the portfolio that they would have, but
[indiscernible] (44:38)
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, the only thing I would add too is I think the FDA – again I haven't tracked the
numbers but the FDA I think has really stepped up the approval process so a lot of the backlog is clearing and that's
creating for some more competition and brothers with more innovative first-to-file portfolios like we have, it could
create a better dynamic as well.
With respect to R&D increase, as Tessa mentioned in her comments, it was all project or program related which is
where you'd like to see the increase particularly when it's late-stage programs. And so just by way of example, some of
the big programs that we have kicking off in 2016 are the Rapastinel Phase 3, the oral CGRP Phase 3, as well as a lot of
work in Esmya Phase 3 and a few others. So, it's – it really is late-stage program-related for the vast majority.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris Schott>: Great. Thanks for the questions. Just two here; first, can you elaborate on the 25% of sales for the
SG&A target for 2016 and how that relates to the proposed Pfizer-Allergan synergy targets? I guess, are those potential
simplification savings now in the $2 billion target for the [ph] Pfizer deal, also (46:02) trying to just get a sense of what
we should be looking at for the pro-forma OpEx when you consider those synergies.

My second question was just thoughts on the broader M&A environment. I guess, when you think about this pro-forma
business post close, how are you thinking about recent market volatility, what that does to consolidation of the space
and the type of targets that the company will be looking at? Thanks very much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure. So, with respect to the SG&A, in essence, stability plus cost of launches which
make a slight increase, I guess. It really is related to not being able to execute the restructuring that we had essentially
worked very hard to plan and we're ready to pull the trigger on when the Pfizer deal came around, and so we put that on
the shelf. I don't think it's fair to treat people – to put people through the stress of a reorganization while they're also
doing a pre-integration of the size and scale of the Pfizer one. And so we have, in essence, put that on the shelf or
canceled it due to the pending Pfizer deal close and, obviously, all the work that's on everybody's plate given the
pre-integration work.
I think with respect to the synergy numbers, Pfizer was aware that we were going to do that and when we built our
model, that was contemplated.
The M&A environment I think remains of high interest to us. I think when you look at the volatility or the weakness in
the marketplace, I think it does a couple of things. One, as it sustains itself, right, it has to stay in this environment. I
think we're seeing some high fliers now become more fairly valued and I think we're also seeing opportunities. Now, as
you know, Chris, you can't strike on these opportunities because everybody's going to look at various lengths of
average price to figure out premiums. So whether it'd be a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day VWAP, you have to let these things
settle out before there's really any actionability around them.
But I think we're going to continue both as a stand-alone Allergan and as a combined Pfizer look for things that expand
our intellectual property and our therapeutic areas to complement our discovery and own pipeline capabilities inside of
Pfizer. I think we're going to look for opportunities to expand our therapeutic area leadership in our key therapeutic
areas much like stand-alone Allergan has been doing today. So I think the thing that you won't probably see both for
stand-alone Allergan and likely for combined Pfizer is large transformational M&A in the short term. I think we'll be
looking more for intellectual property, tuck-in, geographic expansion, and therapeutic area leadership support-type
deals.
<Q - Chris Schott>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Good morning. Brent, as you've gotten to know the Pfizer organization a bit better, I'd be
interested in your thoughts as to how you think your key franchises will be able to maintain this impressive
double-digit revenue growth over the longer term within a larger organization that operates very differently from yours
and presumably isn't as nimble. And then, secondly, just a question on RESTASIS and the Namenda XR formulary
positioning post-2016, if you can provide any comments on that given the competitive pressures that both these
products will be facing. Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure. I'll answer the first one and then maybe ask Bill to touch on RESTASIS and
Namenda XR formulary. I think with respect to the combination with Pfizer, I think it's incredibly exciting for our
franchises and our growth profile. When you look at the Pfizer organization combined with the Allergan organization, I
think the word that immediately comes to mind is opportunity, that's opportunities to expand our capabilities, it's
opportunities to strengthen our franchises and it certainly is opportunity to expand our geographic footprint.
And so when you look at those things in combination, it's kind of intuitive. I think the thing I've picked up in the last
two months, though, is it's also an opportunity for talent and capabilities. And when you have a organization the size of
the combined Pfizer/Allergan, you really need a strength in your executive and management ranks. And in the first two
months, the combination of our executives and managers with Pfizer's looks like a huge opportunity to drive these
businesses and really have better performance in the market.

<A - William J. Meury>: And, Liav, this is Bill. As it relates to formulary coverage for RESTASIS and XR, I'll start
with RESTASIS. Sustaining growth for that product is going to be a function of formulary coverage, share of voice
leadership and ultimately launching other new dry eye products. The coverage for RESTASIS today is over 85%. We
expect that to be maintained through 2016 and we're already in the process of submitting bids at least on the Part D side
of the business for 2017.
It's a very, very popular product with a big user base and I don't expect any real surprises or major changes in formulary
coverage for RESTASIS and I think over the next two years, we can continue to manage our discount rate.
And as it relates to XR, we look good for 2016 for both XR and NAMZARIC. Optum just added both products to
formulary. And here, again, as we look into 2017, which we already have a line of sight to, I think the numbers are
going to look very, very good. Again, Namenda XR and NAMZARIC are popular products especially with neurologists
and select primary care physicians. I like the way the next two years looks for both businesses.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple. First for Brent, I know you're very confident in closing
the deal, but what are your sources telling you about what the Treasury will say and when they might say it or any other
speed bumps along the way ahead of your expected close?
And then secondly for Tessa, are there any caveats you'd like to offer before we see your long-term forecast in the S-4
given that some folks might pick that to mean – well, frankly, is that your long-term forecast? Are there caveats you'd
like to offer? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So I think with respect to Treasury, what's interesting to me is how much rhetoric
there is around what Treasury will and won't do and how many, I guess, supposed experts or pundits tend to want to
opine on this and how the market takes it as almost – as if being real.
I think that the reality is Treasury has issued two notices of proposed rulemaking with respect to this provision related
to inversions. We have carefully considered and evaluated both of those and have constructed our deal in a manner that
takes those into account. What we understand is Treasury is working hard at promulgating the actual regulations to
support those notices and that seems to be their focus, as you would expect, and we don't hear anything about a third
notice coming.
If, in fact, a third notice did become public, then certainly we would evaluate that, but we don't expect anything
Treasury could do could impact our deal since we structured it according to the law. And so, we feel very optimistic. I
think most of the noise around the third – or most of the rhetoric around a potential third notice is just noise. The
Treasury, from all we can tell, is working on promulgating the regulations to support the first two notices which haven't
been issued yet.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Tessa, do you want to...
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: So In terms of caveats, I'm just trying to think this through, I mean, one, the projections
are really on a stand-alone basis and what we provided you were non-GAAP metrics consistent with the guidance
we've provided you in the past. And that's also I noted in my prepared remarks earlier that this guidance will remain in
effect until prior to the filing of the EU perspective to be filed by Allergan in connection with the Pfizer transaction
subject to the U.S. filing. So that's just really a technical matter but – and also to note, it's not our long-term guidance;
it's our 2016 guidance.

Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry with Leerink Partners.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just quick one on RESTASIS. Bill,
maybe if you can comment just how should we be thinking about the growth profile next year and net pricing. We've
seen in some instances where competitors gear up for new competitors in the market and start to repay aggressively the
lock-up market share. Just sort of wondering how we should be thinking about sort of net pricing impact for
RESTASIS in 2016. Thanks.
<A - William J. Meury>: Okay, good. I mean, first, when I think about RESTASIS in 2016 and 2017, and beyond, I
focus on the fact that 70% of our user base are repeat users. It's got a great following in both ophthalmology and
optometry. As I mentioned earlier after Liav's question, the formulary coverage looks really, really good.
You're just scratching the surface of the dry eye market. The percentage of people treated as – of all the dry eye
sufferers is very, very small. We'll have perhaps a step-down in the growth rate. Of course, when Shire launches
lifitegrast, that's not surprising. I think it will recover. We came off of a very high double-digit year.
When I look at RESTASIS relative to lifitegrast in terms of efficacy measures, staining, tear production and goblet cell
density, I think RESTASIS is a great option. When you look at tolerability, it's an even better option in my opinion.
We'll be launching RESTASIS Multi-Dose Preservative-Free in the second half of the year. I think dry eye sufferers are
going to love it. Instead of getting 60 single-unit vials, they're going to get a one 60-dose vial.
And importantly, it's just much easier to administer a drop into your eye with a 60-unit vial as opposed to these
single-unit vials. And I think we're going to find out in the second half of the year that they're really going to prefer the
option. And even when you go beyond multi-dose preservative-free, we have Oculeve and Mimetogen and so we're
essentially building a supermarket of dry eye products. I like the overall outlook for the business.
As it relates to pricing, it's a highly economical product. Relative to all the products that health plans and that – are
managing, I don't expect any real issues. We have excellent formulary coverage preferred status in most plans. I
mentioned the 85% figure. And even with the introduction of Shire's lifitegrast, I just don't see any major disruption.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Thanks, Jason.
Operator
And your final question comes from the line of Shibani Malhotra with Nomura.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Thanks for giving me the question. I've got a couple, actually. The first one is on
RESTASIS and the potential for a generic. The FDA recently issued new revised guidelines and I just wanted to see
what you thought about those guidelines and if you think it's more difficult for generics to come into the market for that
product.
And then a question for Brent and Tessa, I guess. We held a call with a tax expert a couple weeks ago and he talked
about the combined company's tax rate being well below 10%. If there's anything you can say about that or any work
you've done on that scenario that you could share with us, that would be great.
And final question for Brent, I guess from investors, we do hear sometimes that not everyone's bought into the deal
still. And I just wanted to get your perspective, is the spread just based on the risk that the government can block the

deal or do you think there's some investors that are still holding out at the moment and waiting for more sort of
information or to be convinced? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure. So with respect to intellectual property and FDA guidance on RESTASIS, maybe
I'll ask Bob Bailey, our General Counsel, to open.
<A - Ambrose Robert Douglas Bailey>: Sure. Shibani, on RESTASIS, the FDA actually accepted in part our
comments on the revised guidance and rejected that part also. And so we're pleased that the FDA has given some credit
to the points that we were making. They did amend their guidance in that respect. The FDA still has not identified a
release rate test for an approvable product and so that remains a continued obstacle for generic entry.
And then finally and most important, we do have now six patents covering the RESTASIS product. The sixth patent
came out in early February and was listed in the Orange Book. And so we will continue to push the FDA to make sure
that good science is being applied in the review of products, but importantly we'll also continue to enforce our valuable
intellectual property.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. I think, Shibani, with respect to your tax expert's review of the combined tax rate, I
really think we can't comment on that. I think Frank D'Amelio laid out the expectation of the combined company tax
rate many times and I think we really have to leave it at that.
I think with respect to investors' support of the deal, I have been out and about since the deal announcement talking
with investors and we always get unsolicited comments from investors as well. And I really haven't picked up anything
but support for the deal and enthusiasm for the deal. I'm not suggesting that it's unanimous in any way, shape, or form.
We have a large shareholder base with very diverse opinions.
But from what I can see and from where I sit, I think there is broad-based enthusiastic support for the deal and I
continue with the benefit of a little bit more hindsight and a few months of pre-integration believe this is the absolute
best course for Allergan shareholders. I think owning 44% of the pro forma company of the combined Pfizer/Allergan
puts our shareholders in an absolute better position for continued growth, for continued value creation and is absolutely
the right move at the right time.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Brenton L. Saunders
So I think that was our last question. I thank everyone for joining us. I would just add that 2015 was a highly successful
year for Allergan on a broad number of areas, whether that'd be double-digit branded growth in our commercial
performance, strong performance from our generics business during the face of a divestiture, and of course, R&D
productivity both in brands and generics was I think of record pace. We look forward to challenging ourselves to
