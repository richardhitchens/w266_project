our earnings release.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.
David F. DeVoe
Reed, thank you. And, good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, our third quarter
reflected continued solid growth at our Cable Networks. Retrans led growth at our television station and increased
earnings at Filmed Entertainment. Higher earnings contributions from these segments were partially offset by declines
in the Publishing, DBS and other segments.
The current quarter's operating income result also includes $25 million in costs, related to the proposed separation of
the company's Entertainment and Publishing businesses, and a $42 million charge related to the ongoing investigation
in the United Kingdom as compared to a $63 million charge in the third quarter a year ago. Excluding these charges
from both years, third quarter adjusted segment operating income of $1.43 billion increased 4% from the year ago
adjusted result of $1.38 million.
Third quarter reported revenues were up 14% led by strong Cable Networks and Filmed Entertainment growth, which
were both up 17% compared to the third quarter a year ago. Partially offsetting these revenue increases were
mid-to-low single-digit declines in Publishing and in SKY Italia. Additionally, this quarter's result includes the
consolidation of Sky Deutschland and Fox Sports Australia, which contributed approximately $540 million in revenue
this quarter. Our share reported results from our equity earnings of affiliates was $47 million lower than a year ago.
While this decrease primarily reflects this quarter's reduced gain from participation in BSkyB's share repurchase
program, partially offset by the absence of Sky Deutschland's losses, since this business has now consolidated.
Also included in this quarter's result is $2.4 billion of income in Other, net, is primarily from non cash gains related to
our acquisition of the consolidated ownership stake in Sky Deutschland and the sale of our ownership position in Sky
Networks Television in New Zealand. These gains were partially offset by $56 million of pre-tax restructuring charges.
Reported net income of the quarter was $2.85 billion with reported earnings per share of $1.22 as compared to reported
earnings per share a year ago of $0.38. Excluding the net income effect of both years of one time gains, primarily
consisting of the items I just highlighted, third quarter adjusted earnings per share this year are $0.36, slightly below the
year ago adjusted result of $0.37. And this reflects this year's higher adjusted effective tax rate.
Our press release includes a reconciliation of our GAAP results to these amounts. And with that I'd like to now provide
some additional context on the performance of just a few of our businesses, and let's begin with the Cable Networks.
This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating about 70% of News Corporation's total segment
operating income. Third quarter segment results were driven by strong revenue growth, reflecting organic, domestic,
and international channel strength, as well as the inclusion of new international sports networks in Europe and Asia.
Operating income at the segment grew 17% over a year ago level, with domestic channels up 16%, and international
channels up 21%. Reported affiliate fees at the Cable Networks increased 18% over year ago levels, domestic affiliate
revenues increased 11% over last year with double digit growth at all principal domestic channels. While reported
international affiliate fees were up 42%, this growth was 25% after factoring out the effects of new sports channels and
foreign exchange, reflecting strong local currency organic growth, both at the Fox International Channels and at STAR.
Third quarter advertising for the segment were up 12% over a year ago levels with domestic ad growth of 2% and
reported international ad increases of 30%.
On the domestic channels, double-digit growth at the FX Networks and National Geographic Channel were partially
offset by lower advertising revenue at the Fox News Channel, due to the absence of the Presidential Primary, which
occurred in the prior year and at the RSN, due to fewer games – fewer NBA games. At our international channels, local
currency organic advertising growth was approximately 20% when excluding the new sports channel and foreign
exchange impact.

Total cable segment expenses increased 17% over the third quarter a year ago, with over two thirds of this increase
attributable to the new international sports networks, including the investment in BCCI cricket rights in India and
expenses associated with consolidation of the Fox Star Sports Asia and EMM networks. The rest of the increase
reflects higher programming and marketing costs at FX Networks, the National Geographic Channel, reduced by lower
NBA rights costs at the RSN, resulting from the broadcasting of fewer games, and this is the result of the lockout, the
NBA lockout a year ago.
At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $196 million increased 15% versus the third quarter a
year ago, due to a near doubling of retransmission revenues and lower programming expenses at Fox Broadcasting
Company.
These improvements were partially offset by lower advertising revenues, due principally to weaker primetime ratings
of American Idol. At our Film segment, third quarter operating income was $289 million, this is 6% ahead of the year
ago result. These contributions include the successful worldwide theatrical and domestic home entertainment
performance of Life of Pi and the successful worldwide home entertainment performance of Taken 2 and Ice Age:
Continental Drift, partially offset by higher releasing costs, primarily for the successful release of The Croods for
DreamWorks Animation.
Our DBS segment reported a loss of $11 million in the quarter, reflecting the first time consolidation of Sky
Deutschland, Sky Deutschland's results and lower profit contributions generated by SKY Italia. Our results reflect the
inclusion of $410 million in Sky Deutschland revenues. Sky D reported ARPU gains of 4% in year-over-year
subscriber increases – increased to 320,000. We are highly confident with the local management's plan to continue to
grow this business with a strong content and service offering in an under-penetrated premium pay-TV market of
Germany.
Lower profit contribution from SKY Italia, primarily a result of a challenging economic environment in Italy that
continues to negatively affect subscriber addition with SKY reporting a net loss of 51,000 subscribers in the quarter.
Local currency revenues were down 2% compared to the third quarter a year ago with a slight increase in ARPU being
offset by the reduced subscriber base.
In our publishing segment, operating income of $85 million decreased $45 million compared to a year ago. These
results primarily reflect lower advertising revenues at the Australian newspapers and integrated marketing service
businesses that more than offset higher U.K. newspaper contributions, which benefited from reduced marketing and
reduced production costs.
In our Other segment, we reported a third quarter segment operating loss of $190 million. This is $43 million higher
from the $147 million loss reported in the same period a year ago. This loss includes higher development costs at the
company's education business, $42 million of costs related to the ongoing investigation in the United Kingdom, and
$25 million of costs related to the proposed separation. These costs were partially offset by higher profits at REA.
Before I turn to guidance, let me comment on our buyback program. As you've seen, we have continued to purchase
shares while we work through the details of the separation process and through May 7, we have spent approximately
$1.972 billion repurchasing approximately 79 million shares during this fiscal year. While this pacing is a little slower
than originally anticipated, we still intend to complete the full $10 billion authorized program in a timely manner.
And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2013 total segment operating income. And as a reminder, we
measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2012 the $224 million of charges related to the ongoing investigation in
United Kingdom, resulting in a base of $5.6 billion segment operating income for comparative purposes.
Since our last call with you three months ago, we've updated our operational assumptions to reflect our third quarter
performance and our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. After excluding the full year effect of the United
Kingdom investigation costs and separation costs, and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we
expect that our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2013 will continue to be in the
mid-to-high single-digit range, above the $5.6 billion fiscal 2012 segment operating income base.

Before turning to call over to Chase, I'd like to give you a brief update on our plan to separate our Publishing and
Media and Entertainment businesses into two distinct, publicly traded companies. Early last week, we filed our proxy
setting the date of June 11 for a special meeting of stockholders to approve amendments to our charter. These
amendments are required to enable us to complete the proposed separation. At this time, we are on plan for the
separation to be completed around the end of the current fiscal year.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase.
Charles G. Carey
Thanks, Dave. In addition to the solid earnings Dave just ran through, we also made substantial progress in the quarter.
Our top priority is to complete the separation, which as Dave just said, is on track to be completed around the end of
June. We continue to believe that the separation will enhance management focus and align it with our investors, while
unlocking the true value of our assets.
We plan to provide additional detail on both businesses, the new News Corp. and 21st Century Fox will each host their
own Investor Days to help inform investors on their respective operation strategies and outlooks. New News Corp. will
hold its Investor Day the afternoon of May 28 in New York and June 5 in Australia. 21st Century Fox's Investor Day
will take place in early August, following our year-end earnings.
While separation is our top priority, we also continue to streamline our operations by reducing non-strategic minority
stakes. Just last quarter, we sold our 44% stake in SKY New Zealand for about $670 million. We also reduced our stake
in Phoenix Satellite Television in Hong Kong, raising another $92 million. In addition, we took the opportunity to
consolidate a previous equity investment in Sky Deutschland by subscribing for additional figures. We're excited about
the long-term prospects of this business in Europe's largest market with close to 40 million TV households. In the most
recent quarter, Sky D added 42,000 net new subscribers for current total subs of more than $3.4 million. In addition,
March quarter revenues were up 14% year on year and the quarter's EBITDA was positive. Another important priority
for us is to build business to capitalize and leverage our existing assets in leadership positions both domestically and
internationally.
This last quarter we announced the upcoming launches of two exciting new cable opportunities, Fox Sports One and
FXX, as well as new international launches. In many ways, sports has been a driving force for our entire channels
business. Fox Sports One will add a new dimension to our sports business, which largely exists in our broadcast
network of regional sports networks. At this point it's only natural to leverage our sports franchise, our distribution, our
relationships with viewers and advertisers and our expertise at developing an exciting new sports offering with
significant value opportunity and relatively low risk.
In September we will launch FXX an extension of the successful FX Network to targeting slightly younger 18 to 34
demographic. FXX will leverage the stellar job FX has done carving out a position at the top of the pyramid of
entertainment networks. We expect the launch of FXX to add a new dimension to the future values of the FX family of
channels. We are all continuing to build or expand our cable franchises abroad. Our full ownership of Fox Star Sports
in Asia along with a recently acquired BCCI cricket rights in India together will help us ramp up earnings from those
markets over the next 5 years to 10 years. We also recently launched Fox Sports Japan. These initiatives will require
short-term investments. We expect to be able to make these investments and still maintain solid short-term growth.
As we have stated before, our overall goal is to build long-term value in cash flow while delivering short-term profit
growth that reflects the combination of strength in core operations while absorbing the costs associated with new
growth initiatives. We expect these initiatives to enable us to create new businesses that will generate annual profits in
excess of the initial cost in 3 years to 5 years with asset values worth multiples of that.
A third priority for us is to continue investing in valuable content, the head end of the value chain. We've clearly been
very successful in developing new content in our movie and TV studios, just demonstrated by our Film segment profits
and at our Cable Networks. The momentum in those businesses continues. Our summer film slate is well-positioned

with FX The Internship, The Heat and Wolverine in the next few months, not to mention our next DreamWorks film
following on The Croods.
In Television, we're looking forward to the network upfronts next week with a great set of pilots as well as exciting
new cable series like The Bridge, Tyrant and Fargo. There's no such – there no sure things in the creative businesses,
but we feel great about the strength of these operations. In our networks group National Geographic broke a number of
viewership records with its first ever original factual drama, Killing Lincoln in February and as well as the exciting
launch of its new series, Brain Games in April. A great sign of things to come on the program in front of that channel.
And finally at FX, January was the highest rated month in the network's 18 year history thanks to very strong premier
numbers for The Americans as well as the strong season finale of American Horror Story and strong performances
from Justified and Archer. However, we're clearly disappointed with the season's ratings at the Fox broadcast network
and are taking steps now to improve next season's lineup.
We're looking forward to perusing creative risks that offer audiences fresh and engaging entertainment, look forward to
sharing our new lineup of shows next week at the Fox upfront. In addition, to reinvigorating our traditional television
businesses, we believe, it's essential to continue embracing new digital technologies in a way that expands revenue
windows while supporting the pay-TV business model. We've seen stabilization of home entertainment revenues with
the emergence and acceptance of new digital format and these formats are poised to grow the business over the next
few years. We're also seeing progress in the build out of authenticated TV Everywhere services by the pay-TV
operators, as these services to become an integral part of recent contracts with pay-TV providers and rights deals.
We can bring what Comcast, which is an excellent example of our commitment to work with our partners to deliver the
best TV content to viewers, when, where they want. Finally we continue to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet.
Although, we have continued to repurchase our stock over the course of this fiscal year, and remain fully committed to
the buyback, we determined that it is more appropriate to complete the repurchase after the separation. In closing, we
believe we're in an incredibly strong position on multiple fronts.
We will look forward to the many benefits the separation will afford us as we head towards the plan completion in just
a couple of months. Thank you.
Reed Nolte
And now operator, we'd like to have Chase, James and Dave take questions from the investment community.
Q&A
Operator
Okay, certainly. [Operator Instructions] The question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of Nomura securities.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Thanks, I have one for Chase and one for David. Chase, you mentioned the strength
of FX with a lot of hit shows you guys have. You also have some of these shows on Netflix. I wonder if you think
having it on Netflix is a benefit to the network and would you keep them on there to help the network or at some point
do you put them behind a walled garden and drive more value that way? How do you think about your FX hits and how
they've gone to the web?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: You want to ask both questions or only one.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Yes, the second one is, can you have sense for both of you guys on startup costs
associated with Fox Sports One and FXX in the first year so. Any additional costs you should think about the next
year?

<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think in terms of Netflix, we've been – certainly it's been an important addition to our
business, but I think, we've been very thoughtful and very careful about sort of making sure we establish sort of
appropriate parameters, I guess run rules around how we window the products to make sure every business is able to
continue to grow profitably, successfully whether it's content creation business or the network business.
And I think in some ways, the proof continues to be there in the pudding. Certainly FX, has been – has really just
gotten stronger and stronger as it's gone on through the year. I think we continue to – obviously we continue to monitor
all these digital – Netflix, all these digital outlets. But I think that the availability of product on a Netflix is really in a
timeframe that is very different than that on FX, and we think it gives FX plenty of room to continue to grow and
differentiate itself, and continue to excite customers with that product. And in some ways, you get the library
experience through Netflix. So, again, I don't think it's that – it's sort of the next-generation windowing that has existed
in this business throughout.
I think we'll continue to monitor, we'll continue to evaluate, we'll continue to make sure each of our businesses can
grow and grow in a healthy way as these digital platforms emerge. But I think we feel pretty comfortable with in sort of
how we've approached it to date. And we have a lot of flexibility in our agreements, and these digital platforms give us
a great deal of flexibility to control what product we put in, and flexibility in determine what are the appropriate
windows and times that we want to do stuff. So, here again, I think we feel pretty comfortable with that.
I think in terms of the second question, the sort of accumulation of I guess of FS1 – I mean, we clearly have a number
of initiatives going on right now. We do think of it that we can manage these in the context of maintaining short-term
kind of solid profit growth. I'd say between FXX, FS1, the international networks we're launching up next year
probably looking at sort of a couple of hundred million and change to grow those out. We do think that in sort of that
three to five year timeframe, those businesses become profitable, actually become profitable at a rate that on an annual
basis will exceed what we put into those investments and obviously with a valuation that would be, on asset valuation
it'd be significantly higher.
So we think that's the right way for us to approach it. As I said in the opening comments, we think it's appropriate for
us to balance both healthy short-term and long-term story. Our priority ultimately at the end of day is building
long-term cash flow and value. And we want to build businesses, not buy businesses, that's what we're doing in this
case. And we have some unique opportunities. And we think these are all going to be exciting businesses. And again,
we can manage that investment and maintain the type of solid short-term growth that we'd like to do so, that we'd like
to do.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Okay. Thanks, Chase.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Michael. Can we have a next question please?
Operator
Next question from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thanks, I guess, well whoever wants to answer it. But two questions also. You have very
valuable real estate, which you are starting to monetize, first with Fox Sports One and FXX. Just wondering if you
would comment on the potential for any other under-monetized or under-utilized networks to be converted. And would
you think about the upside in Cable Networks over the next few years, is it, or maybe for the 21st Century Fox
company, is it – I don't want to put words in your mouth – is the biggest driver sports and nonfiction or is it something
else?
And the second question is, I was hoping somebody would comment on 21st Century Fox, what your balance sheet
objectives will be and how you guys are going to think about capital returns versus acquisitions? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes, I mean, I think in the short-term – we've actually – I would say our short-term focus is
really executing – I think we always could be opportunistic but I think our short-term focus in terms of your question,

are there other underdeveloped franchises we can build on, yes I think realistically our short-term focus will be to take
the ones we've got and really for the next year or two get them to where they should be. Again, if we see something I
think we always want to be opportunistic.
But the timing was such that we had a number of opportunities to take advantage of. Some of that's the timing of rights,
some of that's the timing of when our agreements come up with distributors. So, and some that was opportunistic in the
international markets. So, I think with a combination of domestic, international of what we've done, I think the focus
will really be in the very short-term getting those businesses to where we want them to be. And we feel great about that,
that path we're on.
I think in general we'll continue to look at the franchises we have. Again, I do think you're in a period where it's
important that you do have somewhat of a shifting from a sort of quantity to quality. So I think, we want to make – we
really want to build every network to a place where it can carry its own weight and really be an important network.
Some are narrower than others, it doesn't mean every network appeals to the same breadth of audience. But we think
it's very important to have networks that really can each have a growth period, so clearly any network has to get up to
speed, any new network. But, and some will get there faster than others, but every network is one we believe really can,
as I said, carry its own weight in the marketplace there.
And again, really focus on building quality networks that really can be leaders in each of the categories. The value is
going to be in having leading networks get product, what have you. I think in a fragmented, increasingly competitive
world I think you want to focus on whether it's again networks or content, product that can be the best in the game. And
that's what we're striving to do.
Not going to say a lot about it. I think on the balance sheet, we are as far as the 21st Century Fox balance sheet, those
are really things, I think we're going to look to that April – I mean that August Investor Day. We still again have not
put the board in place for the company and I think we'd looked to provide really appropriate visibility to plans for the
business, operating plans for the business, priorities, but equally on issues around the balance sheet, return of capital to
shareholders and the like. We certainly plan to continue to finish the buyback. We bought back as I said, it was better
done sort of with reenergizing that post the split. But I think clarity in terms of looking forward, what are the
philosophies and plans around return of capital to shareholders, whether it's dividends or buybacks as well as plans for
the business, I think we really want to do that more holistically and with appropriate bodies in place like the board. So I
think we'll look to the August Investor Day to do that.
<A - David F. DeVoe>: Yes. We surely would try to continue to maintain our balance sheet strength, and we can
maintain a very strong credit rating as we go forward.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Jessica. Could we have the next question please?
Operator
Okay. Next question from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Thanks. Well, again one for Chase and one for Dave. Sports is obviously becoming
increasingly interesting topic for News Corp. I'm not sure how easy this is Chase, but I was hoping you could walk
through in regards to your international investments in sports content, what sports or regions you're still missing that
you'd like to have and what big items might come up for renewal soon, so we just get a sense of how investments in
sports might impact international Cable Networks?
And Dave I don't know if there is any chance you can give us the revenue and cost impact for the NBA shift to the
March quarter, but that would be helpful trying to get the core Cable Network growth? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I'd say in the international networks really it probably applies to some degree domestically.
But internationally I think our focus will be much more on execution than adding. I think we feel we've got now sort of

the foundation of networks that we want. We've got sports networks in Latin America, Asia, Australia. So that will
obviously go with the new News Corp. broad slots of Europe, those are more through the SKY platforms, but we are
now obviously a sports business through owned or affiliated companies, Germany, U.K., Italy, Netherlands. So we've
got – and obviously then sports business in the United States. So I would end up saying, geographically, we've got a
portfolio that we feel very good about and the focus will be on building them as well as if it's right. I mean there will be
renewals that come up in areas, I mean in the international.
In Europe, the international soccer rights are usually three or four year deals so they'll come around on their normal sort
of rotation, and I think there are rights in Latin America that come up, like Champions League. So I think the rights that
exist come up on various rotations; some are a bit longer, cricket rights in India are a bit lower than that. I think we're
only in the first year of a seven year deal there. So terms vary, but I think we feel good about the portfolio that we have.
I think we'd always look to sort of see if there's something that makes sense to add to it, but I wouldn't say today we
feel we have hopes. I think we feel as we look around those various platforms, we feel we've got the rights in place. I
think it's very true in the U.S. with FS1. Essentially, we've got the rights in place to really fulfill the plans. We've got
the plans for FS1 in the United States. So, I think we – you'll always be in the game for rights. I think it's important if
you're in the business to be opportunistic, but we feel pretty good about the portfolio of rights we have. The rights we
have will enable us to fulfill the plans we've got in place. We don't need-we don't need to add rights to have our
businesses develop and execute on the plans we've put in place for those businesses.
I guess I didn't answer your questions. I didn't answer Jeff's question on certainly the importance of sports. Sports are
certainly uniquely important and I think they're uniquely powerful, but realistically really all of these – the four
confident categories we compete in are all important and have been. We talked before, I mean, Fox News has been a
success story second to none and continues to get stronger.
We're excited about the business, just became profitable and I think it's going to really become a much stronger
competitor over the last 12 months. That's sort of the news category, a huge category for us, an important one and we
think one that we certainly continue to grow. FX has been a great success story. Talked about its success in January and
with FXX and FXM which is really the third leg on that, we've got some – we are certainly increasing the breadth of
entertainment products we're developing for it. Some additional concepts, in terms of miniseries and the like.
We've had some great successes around the world. Things like our Fox International Channels with series like The
Walking Dead, which have been a real driving force for them as well as a number of other series like The Americans
that they've added to their portfolio. So sports is probably – certainly it's as important as any, but we've got big
businesses. I mean, the fact which we talked before about Fox International Channels is on track to be $1 billion plus
business by 2015 and that's essentially an entertainment channel business. If you look at that, that's what it is today. It's
not sports, it's not- fix it, you're driving there. It's essentially entertainment channels competing in the international
marketplace. So, I think it is – the focus on sports should not sort of lose sight or cloud the importance of these
businesses beyond the entertainment and news business and other channel businesses for us.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: In answer to your question on the NBA rights, it's approximately a $40 to $45 million
movement in the quarter. The majority of that is related to the rights as a result of lower games – fewer games in the
current quarter versus the year ago because of all of the NBA games that were pushed into the third quarter a year ago
as a result of the lockout.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: That's the revenue impact?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I That's the overall total impact.

The next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question either to Chase or James about
the international television business, in particular, your Fox Sports Asia, Star Sports Asia and the EMM assets you've
added recently that look like pretty nice contributors to growth. How are you guys thinking about folding those assets
into Fox International and thinking about the long-term profit potential? You've given in the past guidance of about $1
billion of OI in 2015. I wanted to see how you were feeling about that number and whether these assets change that
outlook and maybe you could add STAR to that conversation as well?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Ben, it's James here. First of all, as Chase said the Fox International Channels
business, which you would call a classic business, before we started some of the new sports investments over the last
few years is well on track towards that target you mentioned of $1 billion of profit in 2015 and we feel pretty confident
about that even though there's ups and downs in different markets. I think the team is pretty confident about that.
The three main areas have been in terms of expanding that sports portfolio around those channels have really been in
Latin America with the acquisition last year of the balance of the Fox Pan America Sports business, obviously EMM in
Europe, and as you mentioned the Asian – the acquisition of ESPN share in ESPN Star Sports. And right now it's for
the Asian business; the team is very busy kind of integrating the operations of that business.
ESPN Star Sports in Singapore is a sizable business spread across the region and we want to align it more closely with
the channels in India at Star, as well as the Fox International Channels across the rest of Asia to distribute those
channels together to really use that promotional capability and really have a lot stronger overall portfolio in those
markets, and to be more balanced with respect to entertainment and sports. So hopefully bring in something that really
matters to customers in a big way in some fast-growing places as we've done in Latin America as well.
In terms of targets, I think as Chase mentioned earlier, there is an impact of the increased investment in sports, for sure,
I think in particular we see that in addition to the US, but in India with the BCCI and the consolidation of some of the
lumpier rights costs that are mostly cricket rights in India. And that will impact the, short-term overall profitability in
India, but I think puts us on track to substantially greater profitability within a three to five year timeframe. And Asia
and – and in the rest of Asia and Latin America, we think it enhances the profitability. Within the 2015 target, we think
we will be better and ongoing. So it's a really positive move. It's a lot of work right now, but it really transforms the
scale of those businesses.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question please?

Okay, and the next question comes, it from the line of David Bank of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Hey, thanks very much. I hate to do this to you but I'm going to take another pass at Mike's first
question, which is if you look at – I understand the long-term value proposition of the new platforms you've created, I
think you've done a great job articulating them. But if we look at the first year from a practical perspective and we lump
incremental costs into two buckets. sort of promotional marketing launch costs and programming costs, could you give
us a ballpark sense of what the incremental is with the launch costs and the programming costs in year one?
The second question is, Chase, if you look at where kind of Hulu is today versus what you'd like to see it be, if it
executed on its current business plan over the next couple of years, what do you see it being three years from now, if
it's successful in its current business plan? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: If you're asking me what are the – on the new networks, I guess what I said and I guess I'll
sort of repeat it, is domestic and internationally, as we look at the next fiscal year and we'll give more visibility to this
at the Investor Day, so in some ways I can only give you little bits and pieces -

<Q - David Bank>: It's really specific to FXX and FS1.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes I know but again, and I think probably with breaking those things down in pieces, again,
I think we'll probably provide that type of visibility more holistically at the Investor Day. Again, we're making
investments, we think – that's been our plan all along, to make short-term investments that we can absorb while
maintaining a solid growth rate in the overall business. As I said, I think as we look at the next, fiscal 2014, it's
probably a couple hundred million and change that will go into those. But providing more clarity, I think it'd probably
be, to do it appropriately, I think we'll reserve and do it more fully at in early August.
And so Hulu. Look Hulu for us, in many ways, I guess it's true, all these digital platforms, they're a work in progress.
Hulu's got great momentum, I think we're particularly excited about the subscription side of it and the growth, as they
talked about it in the last week or whenever they had their upfront. We think those dual revenue business models are
ones that are really the heart of creating success. One, I think it's an important role for Hulu classic in that marketplace,
but I think the definition of what's the product that goes into that and what windows and the like is something we're
continuing to actively discuss with our partners in it. I think this digital space will continue to grow, but continue to ebb
and flow. And I think we clearly have a leading franchise with Hulu and my guess is Hulu will, if you go out a few
years, Hulu's probably going to look a bit different than it does today, just as I think, you look at something Netflix has
recently talked about evolving their business to slightly different, to a somewhat different business model.
I think that's something we need to decide with our partners as sort of where the directions we want to shift it, but I
think it will continue to evolve as we go forward. But at its core, I think the most exciting part of it is to really develop
that dual revenue side of it, take advantage of what Hulu's real leadership position I think in providing viewers the
opportunity to access sort of more current product in a way that adds a dimension to their viewing experience today
with selective original and other unique products that we can add to it. But it's essentially an opportunity for us to build
up – to build the business, to take advantage of its leadership position in digital space and build a business that we think
adds a new dimension to the businesses we have today.
<Q - David Bank>: Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks David. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Okay and the next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield of BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Richard S. Greenfield>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Your core Cable Network business has been vibrant,
you're actively expanding it in the sports category and kind of live that you talked about, but broadcast TV is – Chase,
as you touched on, really is struggling. And this isn't just a Fox issue; it seems to be industry wide with ratings under
some pretty serious pressure. And you all and others are doing a great job of driving retrans to stem the decline, but we
keep seeing lower viewership across the board, you're seeing more people skipping commercials with DVRs and using
SVOD like Netflix was discussed earlier. And when you start to see cable shows regularly beating broadcast shows
from your own networks, as well as from other peoples' cable networks, what is the right strategy for broadcast network
and station groups as you look out over the next few years? Like how do you reposition this going forward?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Look, I think it's just a question of it's not been a great year for the broadcast business
overall, just from a content creative perspective. But I don't think – I think you've got to take a step back and for a start
recognize these, certainly Fox, and really say the four broadcast networks are still the dominant form of event television
today by multiples. And yes, there's select shows and the world's going to keep fragmenting, and there are shows that
show up here and there. But if you really take a step back and say where do most of these sort of – who are still the
viewership leaders by a wide margin in aggregate, where does most of the event television sort of reside that really
drives business today? It is in broadcast television. I think we have to – I think we probably have to continue to figure
out in the script today, in sort of the entertainment side, how do we compete effectively in a world where people have
more and more choices?

I think there have been discussions, we've talked about it before. If the world had started creating a hundred pilots
across four networks and throwing all these series on, is that the right way? And do you need to sort of be a bit more
targeted in the type of series you really believe in and invest deeper? That's sort of what the cable industry does, is take
fewer bets, invest deeper and bigger in those bets to create series. The networks I think historically have been a bit
more of a volume game, probably a little bit more still stuck in sort of historical practices, of everything goes in in
September, everything wraps up in May. And do you need to break some of those rules? And I think the answer is
clearly yes.
But these are great platforms. These are platforms that still, again, drive the marketplace, create – when you talk about
what is the product whether it's sports, events, entertainment, half hours to hours, what is the product that drives this
marketplace, it's still the product that first and foremost goes to network television, broadcast network television. That
being said, there's no question there's going to be more and more choices and people are going to continue to find those
choices.
But I think in some ways for the networks to compete, what they need to do is probably discard a few rules that the
businesses continue to – sort of the old habits and rules, and probably take some shots. I think hopefully next week will
be the start of that process. We launch a – we're excited about the schedule we're putting out there next week, and we've
think it's an important job to start to try to begin to – not that we haven't done it in places, but I think, again compete in
different ways and try to do some interesting and different things that can really excite the marketplace. And we think
there are real opportunities to do it; the broadcast network continues to be a platform second to none in terms of its
strength, distribution, brand, and relationship with consumers.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks Rich. Can we have the next question please.
Operator
Okay and the next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger of Sanford Bernstein. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Oh hi, good afternoon. I've got another one on FS1 and FXX. I think it's a new one, and I think
you might be able to add some color. I want to talk a little about some of the distribution side. Obviously, you needed
consent from your distribution partners for these conversions – I think you did. Especially at FXX, which is a pretty big
format change. So I guess I'm just wondering if there was any – I guess you got that consent by the way, because it
sounds like you have launch dates. So I'm wondering if there was any quid pro quo around getting that approval?
Especially if they were off-cycle, you needed them to do something for you, and I wonder if they used that to inject
discussions about future timing or magnitude or increases in fees? Anything you can make on that is one.
And then the other just a quick comment would be great on home video. You cited home video several times in the
release and in your comments as sounding like a good guy for the quarter. I'm just wondering, is it fair to say that
revenue is up year-over-year in home video and – it sounds like it – and if so, how much of that was of specific
releases? Or do you think that's emblematic of the entire market? And if so, how is that shaping up between the
purchase and rental and different platforms? Thank you very much.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes, I think on the distribution side of these channels, I'm not going to get too deep into sort
of our relationships with the distributors, we're quite comfortable with where we are with the plans we got in place and
the strength of the networks we're putting forth and our ability to achieve the plans we've set out there. And, but
essentially as to the specific terms or provisions of any distribution agreement, I think those are things that exist
between us and our distribution partners.
On home video, yes I think home video has got some nice momentum. And it'll be up, I mean market's up – I think the
market's up this quarter, I think it was something like 5% and we're up a bit more than that. Really, the real driving
force of it is digital, which is really increasingly getting some traction, these digital platforms, both rental and sell
through.

And we've tried a number of initiatives. We have this premium pre-DVD release that's been a real success for us,
continues to grow. I think the overall marketplace continues to grow really well. I think you see the digital becoming an
increasing, a growing percentage of what we do. The DVD side of it has stabilized with sort of Blu-Ray offsetting the
decline in the older format and I think some of the areas that we didn't like, really low priced discount rentals are
becoming less of a force, and I think the attractiveness of digital really catching on. More people being aware of it. I
think we're doing a bit better job marketing it and I think we're excited that they're, you can – and after obviously you
had a period of a couple of years where you were sort of digesting
digesting a real sort of a resettling of the home entertainment business as the DVD matured, that I think you've got
some growth and I think – I'm not going to say it's going to explode the next few years but you have nice healthy
growth to that business that is really led by an increased usage, awareness, marketing, better product availabilities in
both rental and sell through on the digital side.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you Todd.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: All right. Encouraging, thanks.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Okay. And the next question, it comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thanks. Chase, you've talked about FOX broadcasts going potentially to a pay-TV model
in response to Aereo. So, two questions I have: First of all, would FOX lose money, at least initially, in moving to this
model? And then secondly, would you consider divesting your TV station portfolio at that point?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think you're getting further down the road than I can. I think the point we tried – the point
we're making is for the broadcast business to be a healthy business and to be one that's able to deliver the type of
quality entertainment and events it has, needs to be a dual revenue business. And if it became an ad supported only
business it really would not able to compete effectively, like it's now able to do. And I think it's in the past, when it
wasn't a dual revenue business, it was one of the reasons why you saw product sort of moving continuously from
broadcast to cable. And that in many ways is our point. I'm not going to get into the legal issues that we're currently
engaged in, because I think those, we should deal with them in the appropriate forum.
But that's the point. We believe we're in a legal right. We're going to pursue our – I don't think getting into
hypotheticals is really at this point constructive. We like the broadcast model, as long as our rights are respected, which
essentially means those certain parties that want to redistribute our product pay the fair penalty. As part of that with the
individual consumers that want to access it directly can do so, and with that model we think we continue to build FOX
broadcast as sort of the centerpiece of our overall networks business. And that's a path we'd like to pursue. We like the
broadcast business and as long as it's one that we can get fairly compensated for the product we invest in, and the
network that we built, that's a path we'd want to pursue.
But there are, I guess like we've made, is there are other paths. If that dual revenue stream is not available down the
road, there are other paths we can pursue that we think lead us still to a very profitable business; but our choice would
be to continue to build the business essentially as you know it today for the consumer.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Marci. Could we have the next question please?

<Q - Barton Crockett>: Okay, great, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about ad trends
given that we're coming on the upfront. I was wondering if you could update us on what you're seeing in scatter relative
to upfront pricing? And also on the cable front, I mean you had the tough comp, 2% growth because of the political
comps, at FOX Sports and the RSN comps. I was wondering if you could give us any color on whether we see more
comp issues over the next couple of quarters as we cycle through the year.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes, I mean on the upfront, I mean right now you actually had a really healthy scatter
market. The scatter market is probably up mid double digits, not probably even that plus. So, I'm not going to get –
some of my colleagues like to make predictions, but I'm not going to get as far into predictions as some. But I guess if
you look at the one parameter you can look at, you've got a very healthy scatter market there and you've had a pretty
decent scatter market throughout. And I think again that always sort of comes into play of what we should do there. So
want to therefore invest in the upfront market versus waiting for a scatter market, buying in the scatter market. But
today you'd certainly say it is, the market has gotten a bit stronger within recent weeks, so it's got some nice momentum
to it.
I think in terms of the Cable Networks, I think Dave touched on it. I mean it really is sort of – it's a bit of a mixed bag
on the advertising side. Actually the FX and NatGeo are very strong, strongly double digits. It's just the news business
has got – which is the reality of the news business – the headwinds of the political comps. You had a big presidential
year, election year last year and you're not going to have that spending again. And clearly the news network is being
affected by that more than our other businesses. It's not the great effect in some of the local station markets in certain
places. But that and the events in the RSNs. The RSNs had a number quite larger, I think it's close 100 games or
something less. And there are a couple rights that aren't there anymore: we had the Lakers a year ago, we don't have the
Lakers this year. So there are also some – you always got a pile of, be a handful of reasons, but the RSNs and news
have tougher comps again for political's gains and a couple of rights that we don't have that – the flip side would end up
being National Geographic and FX really being quite strong.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Barton. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Okay and the next question comes from the line of Adam Alexander of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Adam Alexander>: Good afternoon. Chase, I just had a question specifically on FOX News. It seemed to be a bit
of a tough quarter even taking into consideration the comp and with the channel ceding some share to competitors,
which is the first time we've seen that in a while. I just want to get your view on that and perhaps procedures you've got
in place to turn that around?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess it all goes back to I disagree with the characterization. I mean we always have events
to change, and there are certain events, that some do better with, and I think historically you get some events, some
type of events that certain networks become the short term beneficiary. But I think that's just the ebb and flow and
timing of the business. Look, I think FOX news is I think – continues to just, I could use the phrase I've used before, be
a juggernaut. I can't think of anything just finished, like was even March or April, the number two network overall in
television. I can't remember which one was that, was it TNT or USA or somebody to be honest, but it was number two
overall. I guess you want to take a short enough time period, you can always point a dagger at a week probably where
it's not to compare, you know, well, but I think at any form of measurements that take those short term variabilities, that
short term variability out of it, I think FOX Sports – FOX News just continues to be in a class by itself.

<Q - Tim W. Nollen>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. It's a little bit different from all the others proceeding. It's
actually about the Amplify education business, an asset that you're clearly betting on will be a good grower. I would
say there's a lot of unknowns as to market size and growth, and it's looking like a lengthy gestation period for the
education business. My question is really why do you think the education market is so attractive? Do you see
yourselves more as disrupters to traditional content providers or do you see new markets emerging with tech and data
services? Or is it both? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Sure. First I'd say we're pretty much on the plans we laid out. I think we've been clear, this is
something that is going to take time. So, the – and you're right, right now we are carefully engaging, we're starting to
deploy some of the products, the business we bought in wireless generation, certainly continues to grow its core
business. But that said, we are largely in an investment phase and build phase. But I'd say we're very much on the plan
we laid out. So, it's not – from a time perspective or from a timeframe perspective we're where we expected.
We are clearly a disrupter in this, there's no two ways about it; that is the core, the heart of the strategy of what we're
pursuing. Is a view that the education, the K-12 education business in this country, as well as elsewhere for that matter,
is really probably one of, if not the, last business that has been left out of the digital revolution. And you've got industry
after industry that has been turned on its head and taken – had various factions taking advantage of these digital
technologies to develop much better products, much better experiences, much more efficient experiences and the like,
and we think the K-12 education is incredibly ripe for that type of disruption to take advantage of technology, to deliver
a much richer and much more efficient experience to the marketplace, to the students. And with additional pressures
coming on the cost of budget issues you've got in this country, national, state, local levels to find ways to deliver a
quality education experience. And I think everybody says that that is a priority second to none for this country is to
deliver a quality education experience, but to do so in a way that is manageable within today's economic realities. And
the answer to that is using technology and specifically digital technology to deliver that experience. And you can
deliver again, a much richer experience.
I think all of us can sit here and imagine how on a tablet you could have that type of real-time interaction with teachers
and peers, programs developed and tailored to a students' ability. It doesn't take a big leap of faith to imagine why a
really vibrant digital technology, and not just taking old, printed stuff and sticking it on a digital device, but really
developing curriculums that are built for – to take advantage of these digital technologies is really where the education
world has to go. So, that's a long winded answer of saying, yes, it is completely a bet on the disruption, which again,
holding the time is ripe with the pressure on education and the need to find solutions that make sense for today's world
to meet the needs of that quality education.
