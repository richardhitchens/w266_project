Andrew J. Cecere
Thank you, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'm going to start off by giving you some
high-level commentary. Terry will then provide more detail on the first quarter results and some forward-looking
guidance. And after that, we'll take your questions.
In the first quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion or $0.82 per diluted share. Slide 3 of our presentation
provides a summary on the quarter. As is typical of the first quarter, seasonal factors impacted sequential results.
However, on a year-over-year basis, we reported solid growth in revenues, earnings, loans, and deposits.
Turning to slide 4, I'd like you to focus your attention on profitability and returns. In the first quarter, our return on
average assets was 1.35%, our return on common equity (sic) [return on average common equity] was 13.3%, and our
efficiency ratio was 55.6%. We're proud of these industry-leading results and we continue to focus on enhancing our
performance. We expect our return to shareholders and our efficiency ratio to improve throughout the year as we gain
market share in core business lines and benefit from the funding advantage afforded by our high debt ratings and
superior deposit franchise. We expect to do this while maintaining the same expense and credit risk discipline our
shareholders have come to expect from us.
The U.S. economy continues to improve, interest rates are finally on an upward trajectory, and customer sentiment
reflects optimism for potential actions by the new administration. So there is a lot of change and potential opportunity
on the macro front, much of which could be to the benefit of the banking industry. I believe we are well-positioned for
this next phase of the cycle.
During the first quarter of 2017, commercial loan growth was sluggish across the industry. Our large corporate
customers tell us that they're optimistic about the future but are awaiting more clarity regarding potential changes in tax
and regulatory reform, infrastructure spend, and trade policies. Additionally, some of our clients are actively accessing
the capital markets which pulls some financing from the bank lending arena or result in a reduced line utilization.
However, we expect commercial loan growth to be better in the second quarter versus the first and we expect more
robust commercial loan growth in the second half of the year.
Let me talk more about profitability and returns. We're not interested in growing just to get bigger; we're focused on
profitable growth, and that mindset is deeply ingrained in our culture. As a result, we're willing to forego volume
growth to maintain an appropriate level of profitability. We've been doing this for years in our company. In the
Wholesale Bank, we often acquire new customers by allowing them to utilize their balance sheet for some amount of
time. But if we can transition that into a more profitable relationship, we call the relationship. That strategy has
translated into client growth, higher revenue per client, and better profitability. We apply this same logic in our
payments business and every business line for that matter.
High-volume, low-margin business can impair profits. So as an example, we're purposely allowing less profitable
business in our bank to run off. In the near-term, that's a headwind to top line merchant acquiring services sales and
revenue growth, but those clients are being replaced by more profitable relationships, and that transition is setting us up
well for the future. Terry will give more detail on merchant processing revenue during his remarks.
Turning to expenses, our efficiency ratio remains best-in-class but it's higher than we would like it to be. As we said
last quarter, we expect expense growth to moderate as certain risk management programs are fully implemented later
this year. We're committed to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year 2017 with the support of top line
revenue growth, careful management of expense, and reduced cost pressures from compliance programs. And we will
deliver that positive operating leverage without pulling back on prudent investment spending.
We remain diligent on the topic of risk management and we feel very good about our credit quality and the overall
credit environment. Our net charge-off ratio continues to be stable and the non-performing asset ratio improved on both
the linked quarter and year-over-year basis in the first quarter. But we will never take our eye off the ball or fool
ourselves into thinking we'll be able to predict when the churn in the business cycle will come.

Finally, our capital position remains solid. We haven't been burdened by an excessive amount of capital that has
weighed on our returns. That said, we have sufficient capital to support growth, effectively manage through periods of
economic stress, and continue to return capital to our shareholders. Our tangible book value per share of $19.13 at
March 31 was up 6.6% versus a year ago.
With that, let me turn it over to Terry to provide details on the quarter.
Terrance R. Dolan
Thank you, Andy. I'll start with a balance sheet review and then discuss first quarter earnings trends. Slide 5 shows our
loan growth trends. Average total loans outstanding increased 0.2% on a linked quarter basis and grew 4.1% compared
to the first quarter of 2016. Strong linked quarter growth in retail, leasing, and residential mortgages was essentially
offset by modest declines in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and home equity lending.
As mentioned earlier, the commercial loan growth was sluggish across the industry during the first quarter. Our
commercial loans declined slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the seasonal decline of
corporate card balances, which are included in our commercial loans, our commercial loan growth was positive 0.2%.
Somewhat offsetting this headwind in the first quarter was strong growth in middle market lending across many
geographies. Loan growth in commercial real estate reflects our own prudent approach in lending to certain CRE
segments such as multi-family and retail given current market conditions.
Turning to slide 6, total average deposits declined 0.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting typical
seasonal trends and lower funding requirements given the slower loan growth in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis,
average deposits increased 11.0%. Following the March interest rate hike, our total interest-bearing deposit beta is
about 20%. As future rate hikes occur, we model that the beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level.
On slide 7 you can see the credit quality remained relatively stable in the first quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage
of average loans were 50 basis points in the first quarter, up slightly by 3 basis points compared to the fourth quarter
and 2 basis points higher than a year ago. Non-performing assets declined by 6.7% compared with the fourth quarter
and NPAs as a percentage of loans plus other real estate decreased 4 basis points to 55 basis points at March 31.
Improvement was driven by commercial loans, commercial real estate, residential mortgages, and other real estate.
Slide 8 represents some information on two areas that have received a lot of attention lately by the investment
community: auto lending and retail industry exposure. First, on auto; we are a prime lender in this space and we do not
originate subprime auto loans. The average FICO score for originations in 2016 was over 770. Our credit metrics
remain very stable in auto lending.
The second area is the retail industry segment, given recent pressure as consumers alter their buying habits.
Commitments related to the retail industry totaled 3.4% at year end 2016. A little over a half of that is direct C&I
exposure to retailers, two-thirds of which are to investment grade or equivalent clients. We have minimal exposure to
retailers who anchor malls. We are watching this retail segment and are comfortable with our portfolio, given the
relative small exposure, geographic diversity, and high quality of customers.
I'll now move on to earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights first quarter results versus comparable periods. First
quarter net income of $1.5 billion was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter but was up 6.3% versus the first
quarter of 2016. The first quarter is impacted seasonally each year, and this quarter was no different.
Turning to slide 10, total revenue declined by 2.0% on a linked quarter basis and grew 5.7% compared a year earlier.
The year-over-year revenue growth was primarily driven by solid loan growth funded by strong deposit growth and
strength across our fee businesses.
Turning to slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.0 billion in the first quarter,
essentially stable with the fourth quarter despite two fewer days in the quarter. Net interest income was up 3.7%
compared with the prior year, reflecting earning asset growth from a year ago.

Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income, which decreased by 4.2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting typical
seasonal patterns and a decrease in mortgage banking revenue of 14%. The mortgage revenue decline was in line with
our guidance and reflects both seasonality and a drop in refinancing activity due to higher interest rates. On a
year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased by 8.4%, driven by strength in payment services revenue, trust and
investment management fees, and mortgage banking revenue.
I'll highlight a couple of items within non-interest income. Trust and investment fees increased 8.6% year-over-year,
reflecting new account growth and improved market conditions along with lower money market fee waivers. Credit and
debit card revenue increased 9.8% on higher credit card sales of 8.5% and total card sales volumes of 6.2%. Credit and
debit card revenue increased 6.8%, excluding the impact of an acquired portfolio. The increase in other income was
primarily due to higher equity investment income.
Merchant processing revenue grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis, adjusted for the impact of currency rate changes.
This is a slower pace than we've seen in previous quarters and reflects several factors, including: the impact of higher
EMV-related equipment sales revenue in the first quarter of 2016; the margin impact of certain interchange caps
implemented in Europe in late 2015; and our decision to exit certain high-volume, low-margin merchant relationships
last year.
We are growing merchant relationships in this business, but the impact to volumes and revenue is being muted
somewhat by these factors. We expect this masking effect will begin to dissipate in the second quarter. By the third
quarter, merchant acquiring revenue is expected to return to a more normal rate of growth, a trajectory of same-store
sales plus about 2% excluding the impact of foreign currency changes.
Turning to slide 13, non-interest expense decreased 2.0% compared with the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting
seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects, professional services expense, and marketing
and business development. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest expense increased 7.1%. Growth was driven by:
higher compensation and employee benefit expenses, reflecting the impact of merit increases; higher variable
compensation, including performance-based incentives and stock-based compensation; and hiring to support business
growth and risk management programs. The increase in marketing and development expense reflected investment in
the brand and various business initiatives. Other expense was up 6.2%, reflecting the impact of the FDIC surcharge
which began in the third quarter of 2016 and an insurance recovery last year.
Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At March 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel
III standardized approach, as if fully implemented, was 9.2%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum
requirement and our internal target of 8.5%. In the first quarter, we returned 78% of our earnings to shareholders
through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward.
I'll now provide some forward-looking guidance. In the second quarter, we look for modest growth in net interest
income on a fully taxable equivalent basis, driven by improved loan growth compared with the first quarter and slightly
higher net interest margin. Credit card, mortgage, and auto loan growth are seasonally stronger in the second quarter.
Additionally, we look for improved commercial loan growth in the second quarter as well.
However, the timing of anticipated policy changes are difficult to predict. Also, given the current yield curve and rate
expectations, corporate clients are continuing to access the capital markets which may impact that growth in
commercial loans in the short-term. Therefore, we think meaningful acceleration in commercial loan growth is more
likely to occur in the second half of 2017. Finally, we remain disciplined in lending to the CRE market, and growth in
that category will likely remain muted in the near-term.
We look for mortgage revenue to increase compared with the first quarter. The second quarter is seasonally stronger as
home sales strengthened in the spring, and we're well-positioned to gain share in the purchase market over time.
Industry refinancing activity is projected to continue at lower levels, reflecting the higher mortgage rates.
Expenses will be seasonally higher in the second quarter but, as previously mentioned, we expect to deliver positive
operating leverage for the full year. Given the underlying mix and quality of our loan portfolio, we expect credit quality
to remain relatively stable in the second quarter, and we expect the loan loss provision to increase in line with loan

growth.
The taxable equivalent income tax rate was 27.0% in the first quarter compared with 28.1% in the fourth quarter of
2016. The decrease reflected the impact of new accounting guidelines related to stock-based compensation effective for
the first quarter of 2017. We estimate the taxable equivalent income tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 will be
approximately 28%.
Finally, in the first quarter we provided notice to redeem all of our Series G preferred stock and issued $1 billion of
Series J preferred stock. The total quarterly preferred dividend for the quarter was $69 million. Included in the
determination of diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 was an additional charge of $10 million related
to the Series G issuance cost. Looking to future quarters given our current capital structure, the level of preferred
dividends will be about $63 million in the second and fourth quarters of each year and $70 million in the first and third
quarters of each year. Of course, the $10 million issuance charge will not re-occur.
Let me hand it back to Andy for closing comments.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Terry. So to summarize, we feel good about where we are and how we're positioned and even better about
where we're headed. I look forward to leading this company through the next phase of its evolution. Our Chairman and
former CEO, Richard Davis' leadership has set us up well for the future. I'm grateful for his guidance and partnership
over the last 10 years that we've worked together. Our businesses are strong and our culture of innovation is intact. So
as I transition into my new role, you should not expect major changes to the strategic direction of this company given
our industry-leading performance. You should expect an ongoing focus on innovation, continuous improvement in our
customers and employees.
That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill, and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John McDonald with Bernstein.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Wondering about the expenses. Terry, what kind of step-up
in expenses should we kind of be thinking about for the second quarter? And just remind us where does that seasonality
occur? Which lines?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yes. So if you end up thinking about the second quarter, we're going to typically see it
growing, probably, 3% to 4% in the second quarter relative to first quarter. As, John, we have talked in some of our
investor conferences, we still expect pressure with respect to risk programs at least through the end of the second
quarter with the trajectory of that growth starting to slow as we get later into the year. So when we think about positive
operating leverages as far as expenses are concerned, we're pretty confident that we're going to deliver on positive
operating leverage for the full year.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. But maybe we shouldn't expect efficiency ratio improvement in the second
quarter and it probably gets better later in the second half?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: That's the way that we're thinking about it. I think it's going to probably start to plateau, and
then as it gets later into the year it's going to start to come down.

<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So John, this is Andy. I do think we're in sort of at our high level though. It'll be flattish in
the second quarter and then start to come down as we achieve that positive operating leverage in quarters three and
four.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And, Andy, what kind of loan growth outlook do you have nearer-term? How
much do you think you can get better in the second quarter? And what drives your confidence that we can accelerate
further in the back half of the year?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure. So first of all, our starting point is a little higher versus where we ended the fourth
quarter. Secondly, our pipelines are stronger. As Terry mentioned, a lot of our corporate clients were accessing the
capital markets so that did put a bit of a damper on loan growth. But the seasonality on home equity, what we're seeing
on auto, and what's going on with the corporate loan growth tells me that the second quarter is going to be stronger than
the first quarter, but probably not as strong as what we achieved some quarters last year. But I do see acceleration here
in quarter two.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then last thing. Terry, can you just give us some thoughts on the net
interest margin? What are the puts and takes going forward for next quarter? And how much improvement can you see?
We got the March hike. What do you think for the second quarter NIM?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. I think net interest margin, as we said, is going to end up expanding but it's going to
end up expanding slightly, I think, in the second quarter. We do see a growth in the net interest margin as we get into
the third and fourth quarter. Part of the growth in the first quarter of 5 basis points, some of the factors that will help us
as we go into second quarter is we're starting to see that inflection point in terms of the investment security portfolio, so
that will help us a little bit. Cash balances will be a little bit higher which will put some pressure on it. When we end up
looking at kind of all of those, the growth quarter-over-quarter is going to be in a basis point or so.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, John.
Operator
Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. Back to the loan growth expectation. I know you indicated that capital markets
weighed near-term but you expect that could be strengthening. What type of annual growth rate do you expect for this
year in overall loan growth? And then as you look into a more normalized macro improving type of environment, what
is the go-forward loan growth that you think USB is capable of for next year, for example?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Right. So one of the things that we talked about last quarter is that we thought that loan
growth for the year would probably be in the 6% to 8% sort of range. Certainly, as we look at where the first quarter
has occurred, that's going to be hard to achieve. But we think it's going to be middle single digits, if you will, for the
year. We also do believe that second quarter is going to start to get stronger and that's going to start to accelerate as the
year progresses. And so as we think about 2018, we certainly believe that that 6% to 8% is very reasonable as we think
about the future.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, great. Thanks. And then back to the expense topic. Appreciate the color you gave. Just
looking at the efficiency ratio more of on a long-term basis as well. I know you're sitting there at 55.5% for the quarter.
How can we expect that that'll trend as we look into 2018? If you can give a little bit of color. Thanks.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, John, as we've said, we expect our efficiency ratio to be in the low 50s, and that's still
our goal and our target and that's what we're planning to. I would say, again, that this quarter was at our highest level,
our high point, and we're going to start to achieve a downward trend particularly in the second half of this year, and I

would expect the same trend next year as we achieve positive operating leverage.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, great. And then lastly on the credit side. I know you indicated you don't originate
subprime auto. But do you have a component of your auto book that is subprime, that is migrated that way?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: No. I mean, obviously, if somebody goes delinquent and they get scored out they'll wind up
with a FICO below 620, but that's just normal migration. I mean, we have a very high quality auto loan book; the
origination FICOs are 770-plus. On the leasing side, it's even a higher credit quality portfolio; FICOs over 780. So
anybody that winds up with a 620 or less FICO is just somebody that's probably lost their job and has payment issues.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, John.
Operator
The next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Ricky Dodds>: Hey, guys. This is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. Just a quick question on the
professional services line. Down quite a bit on a linked quarter basis. I was just wondering how we should be thinking
about that line going forward, and if the first quarter number is a good starting point to sort of model off of? And then,
maybe, another question on the other fees line item. Obviously, that line item is a little lumpy historically. Wondering
if you could remind us, maybe, what is in that line item that makes it so lumpy and then, perhaps, provide a good run
rate going forward? Thanks.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yes. So let me take the professional services fees first, Ricky. If you end up thinking about
that, that is an area where a lot of business initiatives comes through and a lot of expense related to, for example, some
of the risk compliance programs. It's also very seasonal. It's seasonally high in the fourth quarter. First quarter comes
down to the levels that you're seeing and then it starts to ratchet up as business initiatives are put into place and as the
year kind of progresses. So we do expect that it's going to be a line category that is going to go up. As we get later into
the year and especially as we kind of start getting into 2018 though, I think some of the pressure related to professional
fees as it's related to risk management compliance programs is going to start to alleviate. And so I think that is an area
for opportunity as we start looking at next year. But second quarter definitely is going to be seasonally up third quarter,
and then fourth quarter is usually the high watermark for professional services fees.
In terms of other revenue, other revenue is a combination of a whole variety of different things. It ends up including
equity investment income, some trading income, sometimes loan syndications is a part of that, retail product revenue,
insurance product revenue. So it can be very lumpy depending upon what's happening that particular quarter.
Year-over-year, it's up a little bit, but relative to the fourth quarter, we had some CDC syndication fees that were a part
of that. So it tends to be a little bit lumpy.
<Q - Ricky Dodds>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks.

<Q - Saul Martinez>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of questions; first, sort of a bigger
picture strategy question, I know, Andy, you mentioned that you shouldn't expect any meaningful change in strategy,
but wanted to ask about your branch strategy specifically. You haven't, since the crisis, really changed your branch
count that much, especially relative to peers. You've also had very strong deposit growth over this time period and
continue to, so maybe that's playing a role. But going forward, how do you think about the ideal network size,
especially given changes in consumer behavior and, frankly, some pressure to achieve positive operating leverage?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, Saul, you're right. The branches are a great source of deposits. We recognize that and I
think that'll become even more important as we move into a higher interest rate scenario. At the same time, you're also
right that transactions in a branch are reducing, so 60% of transactions today are done digitally outside of the branch.
So what we've done, and we will continue to do, is change the footprint of the branch in terms of reducing the square
footage, and we've done that for the past few years and we continue to focus on that.
We've also had some reductions in the number of branches, and I would expect that to continue. So overall, the
footprint space, so to speak, in our branch network will come down. The number of people handling transactions will
come down, but it does continue to be an important source of deposit growth. And for that reason, we'll have branches
as we do, but fewer square footage, fewer branches, less space.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Okay. Did you give any sort of magnitude or sense of the magnitude of how much you're
reducing square footage or the proportion of branches that are being refurbished or remodeled?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. From a number perspective, we've been culling branches in the neighborhood of 50 to
100 the last few years and I would expect this to continue for the next couple of years.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Got it. And then a more specific question on credit quality, credit card specifically. The
charge-off rates did move up, 3.7%. I think a year ago, it was 3.26%. So, obviously, there's some seasonality
component quarter-on-quarter. But the year-on-year, there is some increase and I know you talked about retail and
subprime auto, but anything there? What's driving that, anything to be worried about in terms of the trajectory on your
credit card book?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Short answer, nothing to be worried about. As you recall, we've grown all of our loan
portfolios throughout this cycle, so we do have seasoning impact there. We've had acquisitions. We've had good
organic growth, especially out of the branches. So there's nothing there. We saw the same seasonal patterns in
delinquency, so we see nothing that concerns us. It's all within expectations. We expect that the latter half of the year,
the loss rates will come back down depending upon [indiscernible]. (29:55)
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Got it. Right. Okay. And then can you remind me what your – I think you mentioned it in your
Investor Day, but what the through the cycle charge-offs are for your card book?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. I think we've tagged that. It's either, like, 4.75% or 5%, somewhere in that range.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Okay. So you're still well within that. All right, very good. Thanks a lot.

Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Morning, Ken.
<Q - Amanda Larsen>: Hi. This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Can you talk about the pushes and pulls on balance
sheet growth? Average earning assets were down quarter-over-quarter for the first time in many years, and I guess that
balance sheet size, the product of deposit growth and the opportunity set in growing loans, but you remain static, out of
cash into loans, and securities loss shrinking the balance sheet this quarter. I'm wondering if this will be more indicative

of your future plans in a lower deposit, lower growth quarter as you focus on profitability over volume?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. I mean, so if you end up looking at just kind of the shifting of earning assets, I mean,
we are holding a little bit more cash balances than what we have in the past, and that's for things like liquidity purposes,
et cetera, and the fact that we've had stronger deposit growth over the course of the last couple of quarters.
In terms of loan growth, I think we've kind of talked about the mechanics of that. Our investment securities is really
going to grow in line with what our liquidity requirements are at any particular point in time. From a deposit
standpoint, in terms of pricing, we're just really looking at being very competitive with respect to deposit pricing. But
right now, deposit beta has been fairly inelastic. So we don't see a lot of changes relative to where we're at. I think it is
fairly indicative in terms of what you're going to see going forward.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And, Terry, I'd say most of the fluctuation that occurred in the fourth quarter was a function
of cash levels, and that can be volatile given deposit flows and given the loan growth. So if you look at our loan
portfolio, that was up, as we've said, 0.2%. Our securities were relatively stable. And cash will move around a bit and
we'll probably have a little bit more cash as we move forward.
<Q - Amanda Larsen>: Okay, great. And then fees were good across the board. Can you talk about pipelines and
commercial product revenue and also some of the headwinds and tailwinds in the payments line? It looks like corporate
payment products may have turned the corner on growth but that merchant processing slowed?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. No, I think that that is true. I mean, we did see really nice growth with respect to
credit card. One of the areas that I would also kind of focus on is in the commercial payments space. We saw some
very nice growth. Linked quarter is about 4.7%; on a year-over-year basis, it's about 5.3%. It's one of the things that
we're seeing. We started making some business investment in that a little over a year ago in terms of technology. We
rolled out kind of virtual card offerings and innovations, and we're also seeing a little bit of a tailwind as a result of fuel
prices getting a little stronger. So that's some of the things that are benefiting us in terms of commercial business sort of
spend, in that particular category. And then in the first quarter, we're starting to see government spend expanding a
little bit up which is a little bit unusual for the first quarter; it was up about 2.2% year-over-year. And we're seeing
stronger defense spending since the election; it's maybe the way that we categorize it.
On the merchant acquiring and merchant processing revenue, I did talk a little bit about it. But, again, the drivers
behind the 1.3%, a part of that is the foreign currency so that gets you to about 2.7%. As part of the kind of the Chip
and PIN sort of rollout and that whole topic, our EMV equipment sales were strong at the end of 2015 and the first
quarter of 2016. But relative to the industry, we're more penetrated in terms of chip technology with about 66%, 67%
penetration at this particular point in time relative to the industry which is closer to about 40%. And so in the first
quarter of this year we're kind of just continuing to see that. Now that will abate as we get into the second quarter and
in the third quarter as well.
And then I think the other two things that's been impacting that is that we just have margin compression that's been
occurring in Europe because of the interchange caps that were put into place in late 2015. That's getting close to the end
which is good to see. And then as we said, we've been exiting some high-volume, low-margin sort of merchants, and so
that has impacted revenue a little bit but it certainly has impacted volumes. And so when we think about merchant
acquiring revenue for the second quarter, we do believe that that is going to get stronger as some of these factors start
to abate and it's going to become more normalized in the third quarter. And when we think about that, we usually think
about it in terms of same-store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of what the revenue should look like.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And, Terry, let me re-emphasize something you said. The corporate payment systems in the
past few years seems to have had a headwind either in the government side because of lower government spend or on
the corporate side as some large corporations slow down their expense spending. This was a quarter that we actually
saw growth in both, and that was very positive on the corporate side because some of that innovation and the
government side because some of the increased spend. And we continue to expect growth in both of those. So that's an
important turn in terms of the growth trajectory for corporate payment systems.

<Q - Amanda Larsen>: Okay. And just one last one on the commercial product revenues, thinking about pipelines
into 2Q. I know you had a good quarter this 1Q, but then also last year's 2Q seems like a tough comp. So what you're
seeing on the DCM and loan syndications activity, is it possible you can post your view across that category? Thank
you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. Well, certainly, on a year-over-year basis we do believe that. The second quarter
tended to be a little bit stronger last year because of some of the Brexit things in terms of the second quarter. But the
pipeline in terms of syndication and fixed income capital markets continues to be strong. We do expect, given the
current rate environment and just kind of some of the things our large corporate customers are doing, that they'll
continue to access the capital markets. Our capital market revenue was up very strong in the first quarter. We would
expect it to stay at higher levels going into the second quarter. So we think that that's a pretty good outlook. And, of
course, those large corporate customers accessing the capital markets, that has been impacting our loan growth to some
extent but we do see that continuing.
<Q - Amanda Larsen>: Okay, great. Thanks very much.

The next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: So I just wanted to ask a question on the trajectory of deposit costs from here. As you
mentioned, deposit beta has remained quite low. I did notice that there was a 10-basis point quarterly uptick in money
market savings, and I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on, perhaps, the different competitive
dynamics of different deposit products. And also, you mentioned an eventual 50% deposit beta, but what is the realistic
trajectory in 2017 if we only get one or two more rate hikes?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. So let me kind of talk about it. Again, betas overall, if we end up looking at
December 2015, December 2016, March 2017, typically what we have seen, and we're pretty much on track on this as
well in terms of the March hike, is that deposit betas have been up about 20%, 20% to 25%, kind of in that ballpark.
We have a strong retail deposit base that represents about 50% of our overall deposits and the pricing from that
particular standpoint has been pretty inelastic thus far, so we haven't seen a lot of movement in terms of retail deposits.
And, certainly, for the next rate hike I don't expect that we're going to see a lot of movement. There may be a little bit
more pressure, but we still think there's room and opportunity there.
On the wholesale side which represents about 30% of our overall deposits, we are seeing kind of, what I would say,
selective competitive pressure and the deposit betas with respect to that are closer to the kind of the 25% to 30%, kind
of in that ballpark. And then our Corporate Trust business which will be unique to us represents about 18% of our
overall deposits. That tends to be a little bit more sensitive to interest rates, and so if we're seeing pressure in terms of
movement of interest rates it's going to be in that particular space.
As we think about kind of the rest of the year, certainly the next rate hike or so, that 20% to 25% deposit beta probably
starts to migrate to 30%, 35%, and that would be what I would think we would see kind of through this year. It's really
going to depend upon how many rate hikes and how quickly they come. I just want to point out that when we model a
rate hike movement certainly as we get a few rate hikes out, we are going to see deposit betas; there's going to be just
more competitive pressure there in the future. So that's kind of how the way I would think about it.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Thank you. And just as a second question. Andy, we totally get the message, as the
marketplace, that it's going to be business as usual and no large change in strategy. I'm wondering if you can remind us
on how U.S. Bancorp over the next two or three years is thinking about inorganic growth in terms of use of its excess

capital especially in a world where your consent order is listed or you don't have any regulatory restrictions in terms of
inorganic growth.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. As you know, Erika, we have been doing some portfolio deals, credit card
transactions, some payments transactions as well as trust and fund services. So those types of things we're not
precluded from doing. They are high-return, low-capital usage businesses, and we'll continue to focus on them. We are
precluded from branch transactions until we are out of the consent order, and we'll look at opportunities there to
increase market share, our depth of participation on the market as that presents itself. We are well-positioned with both
organic growth that we have today and our opportunities for acquisition with the current model so we're not really
prohibited from what we want to do.

Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Vivek.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Hello, Vivek.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. A couple of follow-ups on those questions that have come up. Andy, can
you remind us where you are in terms of your expectations for timing on when you get out of that anti-money
laundering issue?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So there are three components of the consent order, and I'm going to ask Bill to fill in the
details. But the way I think about it, simply there's the people process side; we're done with that. The second is the
technology component which will be done this summer. And the third is the sustainability component which is really a
function of the regulators improving the sustainability, and that one has a little bit more in terms of uncertainty of
timing. Bill?
<A - P. W. Parker>: So Andy hit on it right. In fact, we got it late 2015. We'd already been working on it for well over
a year. So last year was year of build; this year is the year of installing some of the new technology enhancements.
We're pretty much at a full staffing level, so towards the end of the year we expect to be able to demonstrate
sustainability. And then from there, it's getting all the external parties comfortable with validations and et cetera. So
that's the way how we think about it. I mean...
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Do you think you'd get out of the whole thing from the regulators by end of this year, early next
year? Any sense of where you think the timing lands?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah. Again, towards the end of this year is when we will be demonstrating sustainability. So
after that, it's up to the auditors and regulators.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Okay. Great. Separate question. Other income, which is up 16% year-on-year. You
mentioned in the release that higher equity investment gains. Can you give us some perspective? That's a pretty nice
jump in other income. What is the run rate of equity investment income and what is the dollar amount of equity
investments?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Well I've never gotten into the dollar amount associated with equity investments simply
because other revenue represents the whole bunch of different categories. I will tell you that as we think about the
second quarter, Vivek, that we do believe that the equity investment income is going to be pretty consistent based upon
anything that we see right now; pretty consistent with the first quarter. So we wouldn't expect to see a lot of movement
up or down in terms of equity investment.

<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Lastly, auto lease residuals. Can you talk a little bit about that? There's been some
concerns about that item given concerns about a lot of leases coming off in the next couple of years.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So Vivek, this is Andy. That has come back. So as you know, that was in the $700 to $800
level last year, migrated down to about $200 of gain in the first quarter. But I will tell you, in April its back up to the
$800 to $900 level. So it's bounced back. Part of that is because of a slowdown in production which has eased the
pressure on used car prices. So that has bounced back.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. All right. Thanks, Andy.

Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hey, Besty.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi good morning.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Good morning, Besty.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey. A couple of questions and follow-ups. One is on the deposit rates that you
showed on your slide deck where for time deposits you did increase this past quarter but there was some outflow, and
I'm just wondering. I know for quite a while you've been shrinking time deposits not necessarily in a most efficient way
of gathering deposits. But I'm wondering, from here on in is that strategy still hold or should we expect that you're
going to try to regain some activity there?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. From a time deposit standpoint, that's really kind of a function of what sort of
funding we need in order to be able to support loan growth. So in some respect, it's kind of a function of how much
loan growth we end up seeing. If we do continue to see rising rates that we may kind of change our pricing strategy a
little bit with respect to time deposits especially as we get into a period of time – I don't know whether it will be the
next rate hike or the following where retail deposits become more sensitive to rising rates – then you may see us kind of
shifting that strategy in order to kind of lock in some of the deposit pricing associated with time deposits. But for right
now, based on what we're seeing in the relatively inelastic retail deposit, I don't anticipate that we would change a lot.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then my other follow-up is on the commercial real estate. You mentioned
in the prepared remarks not really looking to grow that line item and, in fact, shrink a bit, being conservative. Maybe
just speak to some of the reasons why and touch on if any of that has to do with regulatory reviews or CCAR process,
SNCs, et cetera?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Betsy, this is Bill. Last part first, none of it has to do with any regulatory or CCAR process. If
you look at the CRE line and you look at the two pieces, the piece that's been declining is the standing loan or mortgage
loan part. As other banks have offered long-term fixed rates, we're not interested in doing that, lot of non-recourse. We
have our set appetite for that and then just the insurance markets, et cetera. So that's the piece that's been declining. On
the construction, we enjoyed fairly rapid growth there for a while. That has slowed, but that's in part because of our
own client base. They're getting more cautious on the multi-family side and, obviously, we follow our clients.
So we do look at the high asset values in some of the CRE markets right now, some of the different metropolitan
markets. So our customers are cautious, we're cautious but we still anticipate the construction book to grow, just not at
the same rates as it used to.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then just lastly on the C&I, I saw the comments around how large
corporates are refinancing in the capital markets driving paydowns, a little bit of pressure there on the C&I loan
balance. But what about the mid market side? Are you seeing the same thing there and what degree of interest do you

think there is in increasing line utilization, just separating out large versus mid?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. So when we end up looking at C&I loan growth, we did see good growth in the
middle market space. And so on a year-over-year basis, middle-market was actually up about 8.7%. And on a
linked-quarter basis, it was up about 2.5%. That represents about 13% to 15% of our overall portfolio.
We are seeing that type of growth across a whole variety of different markets. We've seen good growth in places like
Nevada, Utah, Colorado, here in the Twin Cities, Kansas City, Wisconsin, just kind of across the board. So as we kind
of talk to our folks, we talk to our clients, we're not seeing the same level of access to the capital markets, so that
impacts, really, more on the large corporate space, and we would expect the middle market to continue to grow.
The other thing I would say is as we look into the second quarter, part of the middle market is our community banking
space. And we typically see lift in the second quarter as the ag lending starts to kick in. And so both of those would be
areas that we would look for opportunity as we think about the second quarter.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Great. Thank you. Yeah.
<A - P. W. Parker>: And, Betsy, I'm just going to add one other thing, that in the first quarter, we did see several
hundred million of paydowns in our energy portfolio and we don't expect that to repeat as the portfolio's stabilizing and
improving. But we did have a large number of paydowns in the first quarter.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. No, that's very helpful. And just lastly, the definition between middle market
and large corporate for you.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. Well it's kind of based upon size. It's about $10 million.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: $10 million in sales, Betsy.
<A - P. W. Parker>: The middle market is the $500 million. Above that's the large corp.

Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Good morning. Thanks for your time today. Just a quick follow-up on the auto side, given the
decline we've seen in used car prices, I was wondering how you're thinking about the residuals on your auto lease book
and how they might be performing relative to your expectations, in particular to see if maybe you've increased the
depreciation rate on those leases and just really how you're mitigating the residual risk on that book?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, Kevin, I mentioned before that the residuals have actually come back here early second
quarter; back to normalized levels, I would say. They dipped down in the first quarter, you're absolutely correct, but
they did come back. We're already very conservative in the way we think about residuals and the way we book them so
we're not changing anything there and the market has come back.

<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Hey, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Can you guys share with us – the HA data, as recently as this past Friday, showed the home
equity loans continue to shrink for the industry. Yours have pretty much held in flat now for a year. Can you tell us
what your guys are seeing in the frontlines, why this portfolio is not growing faster, since housing prices have,
obviously, come back quite a bit from the lows of the crisis?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I mean, we've actively originated our product out of our branches throughout this whole
cycle, so we still have $1.5 billion, $2 billion of originations every quarter, and we do pull our folks on what their
intended uses are. And it is as you would expect on a traditional home equity; people want to improve the kitchen or
whatever. But as home prices have really rebounded, a lot of folks are able to refinance out both their old first mortgage
and our home equity line, lock in a new lower fixed rate. So I think that's what we're seeing right now, it's a refinancing
of all, both the first and second loan. But our origination volume has held in there very steady.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: And the growth in the utilization, I think, will drive growth.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. Right.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Very good. You guys have been very steady and predictable on the amount of capital you
return to shareholders. What kind of environment would have to develop where you may lift that number closer to
100% of earnings or slightly above it?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Well, Gerard, we're in a good spot right now, and our returns are such that our capital
formula works. In other words, we're able to generate enough to return that 60% to 80%. We're at the high 70s right
now and still accommodate balance sheet growth. So I don't see a scenario that we're getting to that 100% as far as the
near-term as long as we're continuing to achieve balance sheet growth which is what I expect. And, again, we're in a
good spot; we're not sitting in a big excess position today.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: No. No, I agree. I totally agree. And then finally, when you guys are talking about the
inorganic growth. Acquisitions, obviously, depositories are off the table for the time being. Would you consider or can
you purchase a wealth manager if you felt that fit into your current Wealth Management strategies?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Components of the wealth business, we could do that and it is a level area of interest for us.
Wealth is one of our growth businesses. We're doing a great job organically already. But if there are opportunities that
present themselves we would take a look.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. And, Gerard, what I would say is in that particular space, we're not interested in what
I would call traditional asset managers, but where we found a good fit in terms of a real wealth manager because those
are things we would take a look at because, culturally, that would be a better fit for us.

<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian Klock>: It's a follow-up question, and actually I had to jump off a little bit so might have to apologize if
you answered this already. On the loan growth side, and thinking about the NII growth for the second quarter versus the
first quarter, I mean, should we be thinking about – last year's second quarter you had a really strong 1.5% on the
annualized growth in total loans. Like, with the commentary about, maybe, some slower rebound for the second half of
the year in commercial, should we be thinking about overall 1%-ish, maybe, loan growth into the second quarter on a
linked quarter basis and does that sort of drive the NII growth quarter-over-quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, Brian, we achieved 0.2% in the first quarter and what we said is, given the pipelines, the
expectations of some seasonality, we expect that to accelerate into the second quarter but not likely to get to that 1%
and 1.5%. So the way you can think about it is the sort of 0.2% to the mid-0.5%, somewhere in that area.
<Q - Brian Klock>: Okay, great. Thank you and, I guess, kind of following up on the auto leasing side. There's been
some pretty strong growth year-over-year. Just thinking about if the issues around the residuals and how that may
impact the amount that's financed by the purchaser. I guess, you guys think that you may see some slowing growth in
the auto leasing book.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Our leasing group is doing a great job. You know they're taking share. They have a great
product. They've been consistent in the marketplace. Good turnaround time. So I think that continues to be an area of
opportunity for us. And as a reminder, everything we're doing there is prime. So it's good business and it's good credit
quality volumes.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Brian, the other thing that I would end up saying is that if you end up looking at the
competitive landscape, we offer both the retail leasing as well as the auto lending. And so when customers come into
the dealership, then we also have very strong relationships with the dealership, so when they're coming into the dealer
to make a decision about buying a car or leasing that car, we have the ability in that prime space to be able to go either
way. And I think that's, from a competitive standpoint, one of the reasons why we see the growth there.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: With long-standing relationships [indiscernible] (56:15)
<Q - Brian Klock>: That's very helpful. Thanks for your time, guys.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, Brian.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. Thanks, Brian.
