Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3 and Q4 and turn the
call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can imagine, we are very pleased with the quarter. Total revenue exceeded my guidance driven by the
combined strength of our cloud business, as well as better than expected results from the on-premise software business.
Earnings per share were also above my guidance coming in $0.04 better than the midpoint of the constant currency
range I provided last quarter.
Q2 currency headwinds were mostly as expected, around 6% in most categories including total revenues. However, the
currency effect to earnings per share was $0.06; one penny more than my guidance.
We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency
across the quarter, as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
Considering the progress we've made in our transition to the cloud and the subscription business, from now on I'm
going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business.
We continue to see excellent momentum there, with bookings growth of 75% for this quarter on top of the 147% we
reported last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $487 million, up 38% from last year, 39% in GAAP. Sequentially, SaaS
and PaaS revenue grew 8%, and we expect the sequential growth next quarter will be even higher. The bookings
growth that we have been experiencing will now translate into a significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue
growth in Q3, where we could hit 50% revenue growth, and in Q4 where it should be even higher.
You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred
revenue. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 68% in U.S. dollars this quarter on top of the 70% growth last quarter. Also, the
gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.1 billion and was up 135% in U.S. dollars. We've put the billings
numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
The balance of our cloud revenues come from cloud infrastructure-as-a-service, which was up 11% to $165 million.
While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, we expect infrastructure-as-a-service [IaaS] revenue
growth, which is currently dominated by our hosting business, will be more moderate for now.
Total cloud revenues, which is SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS, were $652 million, up 30%. As our cloud revenue business
continues to scale from the growth we are experiencing, it is beginning to benefit on margins, as I previously predicted.
The Q2 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 43%, up from 40% last quarter, and we'll see further improvement in Q3. I
also expect the Q4 exit rate gross margin for SaaS and PaaS will be around 55% to 60%. And from there, we'll be
targeting 80% in fiscal year 2018. The gross margin in the IaaS business was up slightly to 45%.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $195 million, or $251 million lower than Q1. And I expect the cloud-related
CapEx for the full year will be lower than last year, as we utilize the investments we have made.
On-premise software revenues, including new software license and software license updates and product support, was
unchanged at $6.4 billion. Software license updates and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year
and up 1% sequentially. Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high levels.
New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year but a bit better than I expected for the quarter.
Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth in our on-premise software revenue, comprised of continued
growth in software support that more than offset declines in new software license.
Finally, total hardware revenue was down 10%, which included hardware products revenue of $573 million and
hardware support revenue of $550 million. Total revenue for the quarter was unchanged at $9 billion.

Non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 billion and operating margin was 41%. I believe that for the fiscal year we are
currently in, we are more than halfway through what will turn out to have been the trough year for operating income.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% and the GAAP tax rate was 17.6%, as we saw some one-time
non-cash benefits. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.63 in USD, and GAAP EPS was $0.51 in USD. As I said earlier,
non-GAAP EPS was $0.06 lower due to currency.
Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $11.3 billion. We now have more than $52 billion in cash and marketable
securities. Net of debt, our cash position is over $10.4 billion. Short-term deferred revenue balance is $7 billion, up 9%
in constant currency. This quarter we repurchased more than 86 million shares for a total of $3.25 billion. And over the
last four years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 16%.
The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, we've
repurchased more than 250 million shares for a total of $10.3 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion, for a total
that is more than 110% of our free cash flow. I'd also like to formally welcome Renee James to Oracle's board. She's a
great addition.
Now to the guidance, I'm going to give you guidance for Q3 and then some preliminary guidance for Q4. We feel very
good about the progress of our cloud transition; and, clearly, customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. As you know, we
are expecting to see a material second half acceleration in our SaaS/PaaS revenue based on our bookings growth and
the expiration of customer promotion. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we're taking share in
the industry.
Since we have a clear trend and visibility through the end of our fiscal year, I'm going to give not only Q3 guidance,
but also some guidance for Q4. My intention is to share with you what we're seeing in our business now that we have a
line of sight to it. All my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency.
We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates. I'm going to give you constant currency guidance. But if
current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of 4% on revenue
and $0.03 to EPS, which is significantly less than Q2.
So on to guidance, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 49% and 53%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected
to grow between 3% to 7%. Total cloud and on-premises software is expected to grow 3% to 4%. Total revenue growth
is expected to range from zero to positive 3%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere
between $0.63 and $0.66.
This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being different,
probably better.
Look further out to Q4, we expect to see continued acceleration in SaaS and PaaS, as well as a return to EPS growth
year-over-year. My guidance for Q4 is also in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between
55% and 59%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 1% to 5%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to
grow between 2% and 4%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 1% to 3%.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.83 and $0.86, which is a significant
increase compared to last year's $0.78. As I've said before, I believe fiscal year 2016 is a trough year for profitability as
we move to the cloud. As such, I expect to see strong EPS growth in Q1 and beyond. My Q4 EPS guidance assumes the
same non-GAAP tax rate as Q3 at 25.5%, but that's probably too early to get a real beat on.
Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to improve in both Q3 and Q4, exiting the year, between 55% and
60%. I will, of course, revisit Q4 guidance with you as part of the Q3 earnings call.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.

Thanks so much, Safra. So in the spirit of giving you just a blizzard of numbers, I am going to extend that because our
strong cloud bookings deferred revenue growth will lead to revenue acceleration in the second half and next year.
We talked about a 38% year-on-year double-digit growth. Our billings grew 68%. And again just to give you numbers,
Salesforce grew 21% and Workday 41%. We grew 68%. Bookings $284 million in USD. In cloud, 75% growth.
Let me give you customer numbers. We added 857 new SaaS customers in the quarter; 720 customer expansions. Our
install base is now over 10,000 customers. Over 3,000 of these are Fusion, and almost 50% of our bookings in dollars
are now at Fusion.
In HCM, we added 211 customers, growing faster than Workday; CX 409 customers. In ERP we added 311 customers.
We're now over 1,500 customers on our install base; 450 are now live, 5x Workday's 90. ERP and EPM, more than half
of our Q2 wins did not have Oracle on-premise apps; meaning that in one quarter we sold more net new customers than
Workday did in its lifetime.
In PaaS, we added 1,343 new PaaS customers; 4,100 now over the last 12 months. Bookings $100 million in USD; and
75% of what we sold is now subscription non-metered, 25% metered. Our PaaS is scaling nicely.
Now I am going read you a bunch of names. I just want you to get a context for the brands we closed in the quarter. In
ERP, Blue Shield of California, DHL, FDIC, McKesson, Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric, Wipro, a very large phone
company in France, a very large industrial manufacturing company, perhaps the largest in the world with over $130
billion of revenue.
In HCM, AAA, Allergen, City of Aspen, and Crocs. Think of many of these now that I'm naming again, beats against
Workday; Exelon, Kaiser, McGraw Hill, Genesis, actually a replacement of Workday, Brocade. More HCM, the United
Nations, Stanford University. In CX, Ambev – CX being Customer Experience – Ambev, Expedia, Halliburton,
Lufthansa, Maersk, Motorola Solutions, Sears, Toshiba Mitsubishi, and United Airlines.
In PaaS, Anthem, IKEA, Kaiser, Kia Motors, Maersk, Qantas, Symantec, and Windstream. I could have named a lot
more. I just wanted to give you a flavor for what we did in the quarter.
Just to wrap up and connect a few dots for you on the Oracle SaaS/PaaS cloud, we are currently at a $2.6 billion run
rate in total cloud revenue. It's likely our quarterly run rate will exit the year around $3.2 billion and will grow further
after Q1 bookings. We will book roughly $1.5 billion more than $1.5 billion in ARR this fiscal year.
If we continue to book the way we expect, we should see our first $1 billion quarter for SaaS/PaaS revenue next year.
Gross deferred revenue is now nearly $1.1 billion. That is up 135% year on year and 9% quarter on quarter. Gross
margin improved sequentially, as Safra described, 40% to 43%. We're headed to 60%; and then as Safra described, on
to 80%.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thanks, Mark. I don't have nearly as many numbers. I'm moving right up to 25,000 feet and talk a little bit about
strategy.
Oracle's strategy is to differentiate our cloud products from our competitors. In SaaS, we differentiate by delivering the
industry's most complete suite of cloud applications. In Customer Experience, we offer a CX suite made up of sales,
service, marketing, e-commerce, and a lot more. And in Human Capital Management, we have an HCM suite made up
of human resources, recruiting, training, and so on.
In Enterprise Resource Planning, we are delivering an ERP suite made up of financials, supply chain, manufacturing,
and all the rest. Oracle is the first company to market a complete cloud ERP suite for midsize and large enterprises. By
pioneering this market, we have become the ERP market leader, with over 1,500 cloud ERP customers. Cloud ERP is

now our fastest growing SaaS application suite.
In PaaS, we've differentiated by making it effortless for our hundreds of thousands of customers to move their millions
of existing Oracle databases and Java programs to our cloud with the push of a button, thereby obtaining the low cost
and ease of use of the cloud without having to sacrifice any performance loss or any security degradation. We now
have highly-differentiated, rapidly growing SaaS and PaaS businesses. This coming year we will deliver a number of
innovations in infrastructure-as-a-service as well.
We expect that our rapidly growing cloud business will drive Oracle's overall revenue and overall profit growth for
years and years to come.
Kenneth Bond
Thank you, Larry. Holly, could we please move to the Q&A portion of the call?
Q&A
Operator
Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather Anne Bellini>: Thank you so much. Safra, I had a question for you just based on yours and Mark's
comments about the $1.5 billion-plus in SaaS/PaaS bookings this fiscal year. Is it reasonable then to assume that in
fiscal 2017 we should see SaaS/PaaS revenue growth accelerate versus what you're guiding to for fiscal 2016? Thank
you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yes, Heather. In fact, it will accelerate very strongly. It can't help itself. Our bookings are so
strong. We have so many contracts already. And so we'll be recognizing those basically regardless of how bookings go.
And of course, as you can see, our bookings are also accelerating. But yes, we're going have a phenomenal FY 2017 in
the cloud business.
<Q - Heather Anne Bellini>: Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Right. And, Heather, right from the start it's going to be strong, because you're going to wind up
with Q4 at the revenue rate that we just gave you some guidance on. You add the bookings on top of it. And when you
start Q1 and into Q2, you can already do the math on what the comparisons are going to look like. So it's going be a
strong year, and particularly strong start.
<Q - Heather Anne Bellini>: Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
And your next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.
<Q - John Stephen DiFucci>: Hi. Thank you. Safra, it's nice to see some modest progress in your gross margin goals
for the cloud business, 43% versus 40% last quarter. But non-GAAP operating margin at 41% was a little bit below
what we were looking for anyway. I guess can you expand a little bit on the gross margin progress into the end of the
year? I mean, this is going be a steep ramp and I'm just trying to figure out how much of this is just based simply on
this sort of top line growth you're going to see as the sales promotions sort of and then you start to see the top line grow
that's going to happen. How much of it, if there's any, just due to increased efficiencies as you move along? And then
on the operating margin side, I realize you don't hedge the income statement. But was this due – like what would have

been the impact excluding foreign exchange effects?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay. So let's back up. The bulk of the SaaS and PaaS margin improvement is because we are
now recognizing revenues for which – and much, much larger revenues – for which we have already paid for many of
the costs. And so we've built up an infrastructure that can handle massive amount of usage, significantly more usage;
and we have not been able to recognize revenue because we're recognizing it ratably. As we scale, this is absolutely an
area where it is inevitable that this improves.
In addition, we also had efficiency gains at all times, but that is again because of our larger scale; and those are simply
economies of scale, but the bulk of it is we are starting to be able to recognize revenues for which we have already
invested. As to how many points – I actually – the impact on operating income for us was quite significant from a
currency point of view. But hold on, I'm doing the mast. Q3 – I don't know. I've got to actually do it on our margin. I'll
have to do it while you're talking, while other people are talking and then I'll give you the exact answer at that point
how much of it was...
<A - Kenneth Bond>: John, we'll circle back to later in the call here. Why don't we go to next question here, please?
<Q - John Stephen DiFucci>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillian with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I think by my math the cloud bookings are about $475
million year-to-date; and so the hit the $1.5 billion for the year – $1.5 billion you need to deliver a billion-ish or so in
the second half. Just how confident are you in that goal? And then related to that, I'm curious on the platform or
database-as-a-service. You commented that non-metered was a higher percentage. I was curious to get a sense of how
you see customer usage trending on the database-as-a-service product? Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay. Let me tell you, we're confident. That would be my answer to your question. Our
pipeline – I think I mentioned this at the Financial Analyst Day, but I'm going to mention it again. Our pipeline – I can't
come up a better analytic statement than just huge – and so our pipeline now is multiple billions of dollars. Let me give
you more color. If I looked at the next six months, our pipeline of things that are in the next six-month funnel, you have
a multibillion dollar funnel and our conversion rate is increasing.
So that would tell you – and our business has become scaled enough, Ross, just to be clear that it now is behaving like a
large business begins to in terms of the scale of the funnel, the pipeline, the discipline we have, the conversion rates we
have, et cetera. So that would be sort of my view on that.
On PaaS, we have had a change to your point of going away from metered to subscription bookings. So the bookings
are – now the bulk, as I mentioned, the 75% now subscription as opposed to metered. And I would say the usage of our
PaaS has increased not significantly, but sort of geometrically; meaning that it's gone from when we originally started
the usage to jumped up over the last four months or six months I'd say, to where the usage is extremely high; extremely
high in terms of the increase of our usage. So it's very exciting both in the bookings, the type of bookings and the usage
that we're seeing of what's booked.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Phillip Winslow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Philip Alan Winslow>: Hi. Thanks, guys. And congrats on a great quarter, particularly in the cloud. Mark, you
gave some pretty impressive metrics that's on the customer count side obviously in addition to the numbers that were

talked about in terms of cloud billings. But if I focus on the SaaS side in particular here, really just a competitive
question here. Obviously, you've put up some numbers that are multiple times the size of your competitors. When you
look application by application because not obviously every segment is the same, where do you think you're pulling
away from the competition. Where have you seen the biggest change you think in that position, or the SaaS call it, once
a year? That would be great. Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I'd start to get – I'm going to make this – this is going to be like the fifth time I've said this, but
I'm going to try it again; that in SaaS overall we are just better overall. We have more people. We're well trained. Our
products will have matured, and we have a lot of reference.
Our position in the ERP is just unique. We don't have a competitor per se. I use these metrics against Workday just to
describe to you how exponentially far ahead of our – only person I can think of that's built a product. Just to be clear, in
ERP SaaS, I don't ever – I'm not saying Safra might add somebody she knows or Larry might know somebody. I don't
see SAP. I'm out in the market a lot. I don't see them. So I don't know what they're working on, but it's not ERP SaaS.
In HCM, I think we continue to just get better and better and better. I mentioned because I had a blizzard of names that
I may have done myself a disservice by mentioning so many names. But in a couple of these we actually replaced
Workday. So imagine, in a period of time Workday – sorry, in HCM we replaced Workday. So we continue to get
better and better and better at HCM. And now we're beginning to see a lot of deals that where you sell ERP, an HCM is
attached to the ERP sale. So because of ERP being in many ways a very strategic, very sticky sale, we now see our
attach rates moving up and up and up, where somebody buys ERP and they buy HCM at the same time.
The scale of our Fusion products, and the reason I gave you that metric for the first time is it's now a very high – it's
now beginning to become a reasonable percent of our total portfolio versus everything that we've got, including
marketing, which is having a great run, as you know. But I add to it the fact that now Fusion products, which are
extremely sticky, are almost 50% of our total bookings.
So I feel I could keep going down these metrics for you, but I think we're unique in ERP and getting farther ahead.
We're at the point now where we're over 1,500 customers. I won't give you a prognostication of where we end of the
year, but it's going be well over 2,000. I guess I just did. It's going be well over 2,000. We're getting better and better at
HCM. We're in a leadership position in marketing. I feel good about where we sit.
<Q - Philip Alan Winslow>: Got it, perfect. Thanks. Congrats, guys.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thanks, Phil.
Operator
And your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey, thanks for taking my question. We talked a lot about cloud, but can I ask about the
database business? So 12c is in beta since OpenWorld. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing? Are we
coming closer to Release 2 hopefully? What are you seeing out in the market? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: We see our customers with a much higher uptake of 12.2 simply because they have two
key features that are very important to our customers. One is the in-memory aspect of the database, where we now have
the fastest in-memory database. And the way you take advantage of that, you take any existing Oracle application and
you run it without change on 12.2, and it runs much, much – it runs in memory without changing.
So other people say, use my in-memory database, but you have to rewrite the application. In this case, you don't have to
rewrite the application. You press the button. We run much faster; and by the way, we run faster than the competition.
So we have a lot of our customers who wanted to take advantage of the in-memory acceleration. That's one of the
reasons they buy the new version of the database.

The other thing is multi-tenancy. They'd like to do a lot of consolidation. They have a lot of small databases. They'd
like to run on one machine. And you can do that much more efficiently by running the Oracle database with multiple
tenants. You consume less hardware resources. It's easier to manage. You can back up a whole suite of databases, a
group of databases as one. It's thoroughly automated. So that's the other major reason we see a very rapid uptake.
And finally, we're seeing our customers as our PaaS business begins to increase in adoption, the customer wants to run
the latest version of the database in the cloud, and they want to match that up with the latest version of the database in
their data center. They want to run basically the same technology both in our cloud and in their data center.
And that's one of the unique value propositions that we offer our cloud customers, the same exact technology
on-premise and in the cloud. And those things will then coexist for years and years to come. Then the customers are
syncing up their versions. We have the latest version in the cloud. They want the latest version on-prem. That's also
accelerating the adoption of the database on-premise.

And your next question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Brad Reback>: Great, thanks very much. If I look at the results geographically, Asia and Europe look to be
pretty solid, especially given what's going on in Asia. North America seemed to lag a bit. Were there any specific items
that led to that underperformance?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: No.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: No. You're also looking at the Americas? So for example, hardware revenue is particularly
problematic for us in Latin America, things like that. So if you look at the Americas, you're actually seeing Latin
America, which has issues, of course.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: With Brazil.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Brazil, and North America, Canada all together.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah. U.S. was fine, I think to your point. Asia was strong. We've been doing – our team has
talked about this before. We've been doing a lot of rebuilding in Asia and that has really shown promise for us; and the
results reflect that in the quarter. Europe had a solid quarter overall. We had excellent results in the cloud. And the U.S.
was fine.
In the Americas, to Safra's point, you have the inclusion of Latin America, which is a great organization. It's done a
great job and they're gaining share. In fact, if I look at every sort of metric we have in Latin America, we've gained
share in virtually every category that we compete in in Latin America. But within the context of the quarter, the
situation in Brazil is tough, which is reflected in these overall America's results that you're describing.
<Q - Brad Reback>: Great, thanks very much.

And your next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Thanks very much. Mark, I just wanted to double-click on the strength in Fusion ERP again, if
we could. Just given how far in front you seem to be in that area, are there any specific verticals or geographies that are
sort of outside in terms of how you guys are doing? And I was also curious about how much of the strength is sort of

you guys going into the mid-market in a bigger way or the upper mid-market in a bigger way? Or are you actually
starting to see some broader G2000 deals as well in terms of the ERP product? Thanks very much.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, my inclination to answer your question is yes. But let me try to describe sort of what's
happening. We talked just a little bit at the Financial Analyst Day. The good news about ERP, our ERP suite, is it's still
not available; it's just going into other geographies. So with the last release we had, we've now brought on
manufacturing and supply chain. We're now releasing the product for sale in like, for example, in Brazil and some
European countries. So we actually get some geographic expansion with the last release we had. So this is actually
good news. The strong in this case actually get stronger. We actual now have material number of references. I think I
mentioned, but I'm going try again, we have over now 450 customers live. This is a big, big metric.
Our market also expands in a couple of ways with ERP, which makes it so important. We get two increases on our total
available market. One is what you mentioned, the fact that we actually get to go down-market now. And now we do
have broad market expansion. We get to compete for companies that otherwise would never have had an IT staff,
couldn't have assembled an ERP system; and we now get to compete. We also now – remember when we win an ERP
system, we win the hardware, we win everything; we win the whole stack. So our TAM really goes up on – our total
available market – on two dimensions. The total stack in addition to our ability to compete down-market.
Now that's broad-based. That's why I specifically used the names I did. Our success is not unique to mid-market or
up-market. It's really both. I mentioned the name of the biggest – I didn't mention the name – very, very big telephone
company in France; very big industrial company. These are huge companies at the same time as we have $50 million
companies that are moving to our cloud ERP. So it is broad-based success across geographies. But the good news I
have for you, I think we're just really getting started.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Great. Thanks. Happy holidays.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thank you. Same to you.

We do have time for one final question. Our final question will come from the line of Joel Fishbein with BTIG.
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: Hi. Larry, at Analyst Day you talked about building second generation data center architecture
that should improve Oracle's overall competitive positioning. Can you give us a little more color on what changes
you're making and when this will be rolled out?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Again, I said in my short remarks before we started the Q&A that we will be delivering
innovation in infrastructure-as-a-service. And we have a next-generation data center that we've been architecting and
building. And in fact we've actually put up – the data center is actually up and running. There are actually three data
centers, what we call an availability zone. They're all connected by a fiber optic ring. And the thing we really – we
focused on a number of things. Obviously, availability, performance, security are all things you'd expect us to focus on.
The big surprise; the big surprise is we think we will be by far the lowest cost provider of infrastructure-as-a-service.
We've been in this business a very long time. We're very focused. This is data center version two. We've been doing
this for a while now. And we think that our cost of delivering infrastructure-as-a-service in the cloud is much, much,
much lower than anyone else's costs with this new architecture and these new data centers. And we'll be passing that on
to our customers.
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay. You know what, I just needed to answer I think John DiFucci's question, which I think
it's about from here about 3.5 points to four points, something like that. Okay?
