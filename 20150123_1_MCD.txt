Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 2014 was a difficult year during, which performance fell short of our
expectations, but it was also a building year. As we entered 2014, we were well aware of the obstacles that we faced in
terms of growing comparable sales and margins amid ongoing broad-based challenges and cost pressures throughout
our P&L.
Now while some of the challenges were anticipated, others were not, like the supplier issue in Asia-Pacific, Middle
East, Africa and the volatile operating environment in Russia and the Ukraine and we experienced shortfalls in our
internal plans, particularly, in key markets such as the U.S. In response to these shortfalls, we took a number of
important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround. We're acting with a sense of urgency as these steps are critical
to addressing current performance and to advancing our longer-term strategies.
Specifically, we renewed our focus on our customers with the evolution of our strategic plan. We brought in new talent
in several major markets around the world to provide innovative thinking and fresh perspectives. We announced the
changes that we're making to the U.S. organization to put decision-making and accountability closer to the customer.
We redefined menu choice and personalization with the introduction of the Create Your Taste platform in Australia and
the U.S. We focused on the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and the
initiation of our global digital strategy. And we did more to bolster trust in brand McDonald's because we know that
when our customers feel good about us and about eating at McDonald's, they visit us more often.
Now let's turn to 2014 results. In constant currencies, operating income was down 15% for the fourth quarter and 8%
for the year. Earnings per share was down 14% for the quarter and 11% for the full year, both in constant currencies.
Excluding the impact of the higher tax rate and the supplier issue in APMEA, earnings per share for the year would
have been down 1% in constant currencies.
For the full year, global system-wide sales grew 1% in constant currencies and global comparable sales were down 1%.
Comparable sales were down 90 basis points for the quarter. Looking to January, comparable sales are expected to be
negative due in part to the shift in Chinese New Year and consumer perception issues in Japan.
The changes we're making are designed to refocus our system on those areas that matter most to our customers for
today and for the future. And that starts with deepening our relationship with customers to increase relevance, drive
traffic and position McDonald's for longer-term growth. Our actions are guided by our four strategic growth priorities,
which are broad enough that markets adapt and focus on those elements most relevant to their local customer basis.
Beyond our existing menu, we're asserting McDonald's burger leadership by offering greater customization and choice.
Not only does Create Your Taste provide new menu news that excites consumers, it has the potential to lift sales of
core classics by bringing more customers into our restaurants. At the same time, we're strengthening the menu pipeline
to create greater choice at the local level that reflect attributes like taste preferences and demographics and those things
that make each market unique. Greater localization enables us to take advantage of those attributes and tailor our menu
and our marketing efforts to strengthen our relevance and appeal to customers in those regions.
You'll also see changes in our customer service models as we work to create more memorable experiences and to
deliver unparalleled convenience. For example, multiple order point strategies include self-order kiosks, table service,
or mobile order and payment will modernize our customers interact with our brand and quite simply make it easier to
get McDonald's their way, whatever that might be.
We're also strengthening the value proposition. We're strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry
level, core, and premium tiers of our menu. At the same time, we're thinking differently about how to encourage
customers to bundle products and use add-on purchases to create a satisfying affordable meal.
You'll also see a shift in the way we engage our customers and consumers in general. We're being bold and direct as we
talk about what matters most to customers, especially the quality of our menu ingredients, with multifaceted efforts like
Our Food, Your Questions in markets including the U.S, Canada, and Australia.
Collectively, these changes create the McDonald's Experience of the Future, which brings the work that's happening
within each strategic priority together to deliver changes our customers will notice. It builds on the investments we've

already made in technology, re-imaging our restaurants, and operations improvement, with an increased emphasis on
tangible customer-centric innovations for menu and service to profitably grow the business.
We have enduring competitive advantages that have served us well over time, and those advantages are even more
relevant today. Our size and geographically diversified restaurant portfolio allow us to test new products and concepts
at a local level and then broadly scale those that are successful, like we've done in the past with beverages and like
we're currently doing with Create Your Taste.
McDonald's operates as one single brand, allowing us to focus our energy and resources on evolving the customer
experience and changing the way we engage with consumers while also leveraging the equity inherent in our iconic
core products.
Our global infrastructure enables us to tap into a variety of perspectives and expertise. Our franchisees are an integral
part of the communities in which they do business. Suppliers bring innovation in their disciplines, and company
employees focus on strategic direction to complement day-to-day execution in our restaurants.
And finally, our strong financial foundation, which is supported by industry-leading average unit volumes; it enables us
to pursue our global growth priorities in every type of operating environment while returning significant amounts of
cash to shareholders each year.
Now on our July call, we outlined the steps required over a 12 to 18-month period to strengthen our foundation and
enhance our relevance and appeal to customers. Having reached the six-month mark, we're beginning to see signs of
progress in some of our priority markets. While the specifics vary across the markets, the underlying formula has been
very consistent. In 2014, these markets brought in fresh leadership with new perspectives on how to get customers back
in the restaurants. They strengthened franchisee alignment in those relationships and reemphasized value and
reenergized our marketing approaches.
We're already seeing a shift in Australia, which has over 900 restaurants. It started with fundamental improvements in
our marketing efforts and across our entire menu. And it was enabled by much stronger alignment with our franchisees.
We're building on this strong foundation with plans to roll Create Your Taste across the majority of our restaurants by
the end of this year. It's the first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery, with positive comparable
sales and guest counts since September.
It will take longer to see an uptick in the U.S., which has more than 14,000 restaurants across 22 different regions. The
changes we announced last year to create a flatter, more nimble organization have opened the door for decisions to be
made closer to the customer. Mike Andres is on the call today, and he can share more during the Q&A about the work
that's being done to take shape around our menu, marketing, and service, which will enhance our relevance and appeal
to customers.
Now over to Germany; negative trends are beginning to moderate, with the month of December marking the highest
comparable sales performance in more than two years. While we expect an uneven recovery as market dynamics
remain challenging in the near term, we are focused on driving sales and guest counts by strengthening value offers,
highlighting the quality of both core and premium products in our marketing messages, and aggressively pursuing
growth opportunities within the family and breakfast businesses. Our position in Australia, the U.S., and Germany is
much like what the UK experienced in the early 2000s. We can and we will turn around these markets with a balanced
approach.
Russia and China are also key markets that are in a recovery mode. While the specific tactics are different, both
markets are focused on enhancing our brand image and winning customers back by emphasizing food quality and also
celebrating the many reasons to choose McDonald's, such as convenience and affordability. Fourth quarter comparable
sales in China were negative 6.7% due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue. Each month of the quarter showed
sequential improvement, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing customer recovery efforts in the market.
Finally, in Japan, the team continues to work to overcome significant challenges. The market is executing a
multifaceted brand recovery campaign, which is designed to rebuild brand trust and strengthen quality and affordability

perceptions. While we know these actions will win back customers, history tells us that these efforts will take time to
resonate, so we expect continued volatility in the market through most of 2015.
2015 will be a year of regaining momentum globally. We expect further growth amid the pockets of success we're
already seeing. However, it will take time, especially in our larger markets, for customers to notice the comprehensive
changes that are underway. So our internal projections assume continued sales and earnings pressure and volatility in
the business, particularly in the first half of the year.
In light of continuing headwinds, we made thoughtful adjustments to our 2015 plans, pulling back in some areas to
fund key growth initiatives focused on delivering greater customer relevance, broader consumer reach and better
restaurant execution. For example, we've reduced capital expenditures by paring back on new store openings in markets
that are experiencing significant near-term challenges including China, Russia, Germany and the United States. And
we're redirecting G&A from the U.S. business and corporate to priority initiatives that will drive our growth. We're
committed to taking necessary actions to improve performance and position McDonald's for enduring profitable growth
into the future.
As we embark on a new year, we maintain high expectations of ourselves and for our brand. I remain confident in our
prospects, both in the near and long term. We're keenly focused on the opportunities that exist within our global growth
priorities to serve our customers' favorite food and drink to create memorable experiences, to offer unparalleled
convenience and to become an even more trusted brand.
We're changing. And we're doing it aggressively. We know that some tactics will be different from market-to-market
and region-to-region around the world and that's why our plans are supported by comprehensive and localized
execution approaches that rely on our franchisees, our company employees and suppliers to satisfy customer
expectations and drive stronger business results.
Thanks again for being on the call, everyone, and I'll now turn it over to Pete.
Peter Bensen
Thanks, Don, and hi, everyone.
2014 was a challenging year for McDonald's all around the world. Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and
across each of our geographic segments. Today, I'd like to spend a few minutes putting our 2014 performance into
perspective, providing details on some key fourth quarter numbers and outlining the critical components of our 2015
financial plans. I'll begin by reviewing our results for the quarter and full year, highlighting the three factors that had a
notable impact on performance in each of our major geographic segments.
First is the underperformance of our U.S. business. Throughout 2014, our results reflect the impact of ongoing
broad-based challenges, including operating in an increasingly competitive marketplace amid sluggish industry growth.
For the year, the segment's operating income declined $257 million or 7%, partly due to negative comparable sales and
guest counts, which contributed to margin declines. U.S. results were also impacted by higher G&A spending and other
operating expenses associated with positioning the U.S. business for the future, including the segments revamped
marketing approach and development of the new Brand Love campaign. We expect to incur additional U.S.
restructuring costs in the first quarter.
The second significant item that affected our global results was the APMEA supplier issue. The total impact from lost
sales and expenses associated with our customer recovery efforts was approximately $110 million or $0.09 per share
for the quarter and $290 million or $0.23 per share for the full year. The markets most affected by this issue include
China, Japan and Hong Kong. Prior to the supplier issue, these markets collectively represented about 10% of global
system-wide sales and 5% of global operating income. In APMEA, our results were also pressured by ongoing
performance issues in Japan. For the full year, APMEA's operating income declined 28% or 25% in constant
currencies, $413 million. Japan's contribution to APMEA's operating income includes royalties and the company's
share of McDonald's Japan after-tax results.

The third significant impact on McDonald's global results for 2014 was in Russia and the Ukraine. During 2014,
McDonald's Europe experienced significant declines in company-operated margins driven by weakening currencies and
economic slowdown and store closures in these two markets. For the year, Europe reported a $90 million decrease in
operating income, a 2% decline in constant currencies with the segment's company-operated margins weighing heavily
on results. The entire operating income decline for the year was solely driven by Russia and the Ukraine
company-operated margin results. Over half of this margin decline reflected a significant impact of weakening
currencies on imported commodity costs in these two markets. We expect this currency impact to significantly pressure
the segment's company-operated margins again in 2015, especially in the first half.
While we expect to move beyond some of these unique events of last year certain challenges remain. In the U.S, our
turnaround initiatives to reignite momentum are in progress. Mike Andres and the U.S. leadership team are
implementing a new, more nimble organizational structure that places decision-making back in the hands of the local
market teams. The U.S. business is working aggressively to implement these changes, but it will take time before we
see the benefits in the segment's overall financial results. In Russia, while all of our restaurants impacted by the
temporary closures are back in operation, the market remains in a recession and the economic outlook is weak. More
broadly, consumer confidence across most of Europe is forecasted to remain low throughout 2015.
In APMEA, in response to the supplier issue, customer recovery efforts initiated in September in each of our impacted
markets. While sales trends in China showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter, our best estimate is that it
will take at least three to six more months for our business in China to return to a normalized level.
For McDonald's Japan, recovery from the supplier issue has not been as strong. At the same time, new consumer
perception issues have emerged which have further depressed sales and profitability. We expect these issues to impact
results for the foreseeable future. Japan remains on our priority market list.
Next, I want to provide a 2014 update and a 2015 preview for some of our key financial items. Commodities, pricing,
G&A and currencies. I'll start with commodity costs for the U.S. and Europe.
For the fourth quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose approximately 3.5%, primarily due to higher beef prices. For the full
year, commodity costs ended up about 3%, which was the upper-end of our forecast, as reductions in other
commodities were more than offset by increases in beef. Commodity cost pressure is expected to continue into 2015,
with the full year increase projected at 1.5% to 2.5%, again driven primarily by beef.
Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up 1% for the fourth quarter and were relatively flat for the full
year. For 2015, our full-year outlook is for Europe's grocery basket to also reflect an increase of 1.5% to 2.5%. To help
offset this pressure, we have taken some price increases. The U.S. ended 2014 with pricing up roughly 1.8%, notably
lower than the 2013 increase of about 3% and lower than food away from home inflation, which ended the year at 3%.
During the second half of the year, we consciously did not completely offset the prior year price increases that rolled
off. This further pressured our margins during the third and fourth quarters. And based on where we stand at the start of
2015, we expect this pressure to continue in the near term. Our price increases in Europe vary by market with the
overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year.
Consolidated G&A increased 9% in constant currencies for the fourth quarter and 5% in constant currencies for the
year. For the quarter, these increases were driven largely by costs associated with positioning our U.S. business for the
future as well as costs related to our long-term growth initiatives. As I mentioned in October, during 2014, we
identified $100 million of G&A savings in the U.S. and corporate. These savings are being redirected toward our
critical long-term growth initiatives in 2015. Our review of the corporate G&A spending was completed in December.
We are nearing the completion of our full G&A review of the U.S. and will provide more details on these efforts later
this quarter.
While our G&A increased for both periods in 2014, I want to emphasize an important point. McDonald's operates in a
pay-for-performance culture. As such, short-term incentive payouts for 2014 were zero for all corporate and U.S.
employees. In addition, 2014 performance negatively impacted management's long-term incentive compensation.

Page 6 of 14
We expect 2015 G&A to increase 7% to 8% in constant currencies, primarily due to the restoration of incentive pay.
Excluding incremental incentive-based compensation, 2015 G&A is expected to increase 1% to 2%. More than 100%
of this remaining increase relates to costs associated with the expansion of our strategic growth initiatives, including
Experience of the Future and our digital strategy.
Foreign currencies proved to be another headwind in 2014, with translation negatively impacting fourth quarter EPS by
$0.08, and full year EPS by $0.12. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all major foreign
currencies, we expect a negative translation on first quarter 2015 of $0.08 to $0.10 per share, and a full-year impact of
$0.35 to $0.40 per share. As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move
throughout the year.
Finally, I'd like to share our current capital expenditure and restaurant opening plans for the upcoming year. Our plan
for 2015 capital expenditure budget is approximately $2 billion, nearly $1 billion less than our initial capital
expenditure plan last year. The decrease in our 2015 capital expenditures is driven primarily by an $800 million
decrease in capital allocated to new restaurant openings. The most notable reductions will take place in markets
experiencing the greatest challenges: China, Russia, Germany and the U.S.
Our $2 billion capital budget is divided relatively evenly with approximately one-half earmarked for new restaurant
openings and the remaining $1 billion dedicated to reinvestments. We continue to rigorously screen new restaurant
opportunities to determine where they will generate the most attractive returns, given each market's potential,
competitive environment and current industry dynamics. In 2015, we do expect to open more than 1,000 McDonald's
restaurants primarily in China, the U.S, Russia, and France. This compares with about 1,300 restaurant openings in
2014. On a net basis, we expect 600 to 700 additions for the year compared with approximately 800 in 2014.
The majority of our reinvestment dollars are slated for the U.S. and Europe. Expansion of the Create Your Taste Burger
platform in up to 2,000 restaurants in the U.S. and continued roll-out of Experience of the Future in Europe accounts
for a majority of the reinvestment dollars.
Earlier this year, we outlined plans to pursue additional opportunities to enhance shareholder value by optimizing our
capital and ownership structures and scrutinizing our G&A spending. As we close out the first year of our three-year
plan, I'd like to update you on our progress.
During 2014, we refranchised over 400 restaurants against our three-year target of at least 1,500. In the area of G&A,
we identified and redirected nearly $100 million in savings for 2015 toward future long-term growth initiatives such as
the digital strategy and the McDonald's Experience of the Future. And as always, we continue to explore additional
savings opportunities.
As we move into 2015, we remain on track to deliver against our three-year target to return $18 billion to $20 billion to
shareholders between 2014 and 2016 in the form of dividends and share repurchases, having returned $6.4 billion to
shareholders last year.
We're moving forward aggressively to regain business momentum. Together, our strategy, strengths, and structure
provide the capability and opportunity for us to change the trajectory of the business and our financial performance.
We're on the right path. We've made tough decisions, are holding our sales to rigorous standards of performance, and
are doing more with less. As a system, our charge over the coming year is to accelerate the pace of change and elevate
the overall McDonald's experience in the eyes of our customers.
Thanks, now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin the Q&A.
Q&A
<A - Chris Stent>: Thanks, Pete. I will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] To
give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We'll come
back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. The first question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill

<Q - Joseph Terrence Buckley>: Thank you. I'm going to cheat right away and ask two, but that's down from three, so
I'm directionally complying. A lot of discussion of plans for the U.S., and it seems more long term than near term.
Near-term sales results notwithstanding the slight improvement in the month of December have been so weak, I guess
I'm curious what the plan is to change the trajectory of sales.
And then the related question I guess is on Create Your Taste. I think when we visited the restaurant with you at your
mini-meeting in December, that was the sixth restaurant with Create Your Taste. Now you're talking about 2,000. What
is making you accelerate this from a financial standpoint? How confident are you that it works? And what are the
economics of Create Your Taste, I guess, is the basic question?
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, Joe. Thanks for the question, or questions in this case, a couple of things. What I'll do
is I'll respond a little bit to the Create Your Taste piece. And then I'm going to ask Mike to speak a little bit to some of
those initiatives and actions that are actually in the nearer term because I think that was really your question.
Relative to Create Your Taste, please keep this in mind. We have been modeling out, looking at Create Your Taste,
Build Your Burger now for over three years. We started this in the Innovation Center. We moved it to a test launch
restaurant in Romeoville. As you know, Joe, when we look at something, we look at all aspects of the implementation
from not only the production side and the service side to crew interactions to consumer relevance. And so we've been
doing quite a bit in the prior years. Then we've had this in a restaurant in test in the California area, in the SoCal area.
We had it in test for about another year-plus.
Also keep in mind, we've had similar initiatives in markets outside of the U.S., markets like France on the service side
of this. We've been looking at some of the digital application pieces of this in markets like Sweden. So all of these
things have come together into what we today call Create Your Taste. So as we move forward now, this is not about
just having had one restaurant, this is about having three-plus years, four-odd years of looking at a concept and various
pieces of that concept coming together.
Create Your Taste is not just about the food from a customization and personalization perspective, it's also about the
digital engagement and interaction of customers via kiosks or mobile ordering. It's also about a change relative to the
interaction with our restaurant employees and how they engage and embrace the customers. It's also about the physical
changes within the restaurant as well as how we present our food so that you can understand and see the freshness of
the produce and the quality of our proteins. And so this is a much broader piece than simply about the food itself. It is
about the overall experience.
And so hopefully that answers that question. I'll ask Mike to speak a little bit on some of the things taking place in the
U.S. because there are quite a few relative to the nearer term.
<A - Michael Dean Andres>: Hi, Joe. As you mentioned, we're looking at our business clearly from a near-term and a
longer-term perspective. In the nearer term, this is a market share game that's always going to be a market share game.
So we trust and we expect to see a more customized approach from our owner operators in terms of an owner operator
driven business plan.
Locally, it's based on the customer insights and the unique competitive sets in the marketplace, and these plans are
going to be multi-layered in nature. You'll see disruptive value. You'll see new product news. You'll see service
initiatives. And then our regional management in our new structure is empowered to commit the resources to make
these plans come to life. I don't think it can be underestimated the power of ownership by owner operators of their own
plan to execute it, own it, and get results that we expect to get from those marketplaces.
We're also looking at our marketing approach and making sure that we're leveraging the power of the three layers of
marketing. Clearly, we've got our local co-ops, we've got our national and we also have local store marketing, and
we're looking at a revamped marketing approach that better coordinates the specific roles and deliverables of our co-op
marketing plans using more sophisticated analytics and data to understand the best way to approach.
Certainly, our national messaging comes on top of it to help build our brand. We have a unique relationship with our
customers and the recent advertising is rekindling that relationship in a way that we have been used to over the years

and we have enjoyed. And then the local market aspect of it is that it's been our heritage, owner operators and
McDonald's being the hub of their local communities, very important to our turnaround plan as well as the local
marketing store, things that they're doing to combat the guy across the street from them. That's kind of the key to that.
Then, we're looking at how we address the simplicity, or the complexity, I should say, of our menu. We've simplified
our menu as we talked about last month. That's going into place, as a matter of fact, this week. It includes reduction in
EVMs, other menu items, our test market results which included faster order times and faster total times in the
drive-through continue to see performance above the controls. So no single initiative is going to drive the
improvements, but it's all these working together and things that will create a differentiated customer experience that
our customers will notice.
So we're looking at the U.S. as 22 different regions. As you know, there's multiple markets within those regions. We're
already seeing pockets of success and expect those pockets of success to grow. And then parallel to this short-term,
we're looking at a longer term of refining our plans to make comprehensive changes that create an enhanced experience
for the customers and continue to differentiate McDonald's from the other QSRs. So Don talked about CYT, you asked
about it. That is only one element of this refined experience. It is comprehensive in nature. We are calling it the
Experience of the Future. We're co-creating this with our owner operators, and we will present the plan to all of our
owner operators at a National Meeting, in March, and right after that, we'll start aggressively expanding that up to
2,000 stores in 2015.
<A - Chris Stent>: Okay, next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Karen Holthouse>: Hi, thank you for taking the question. So we've seen pretty meaningful pressure on margins
in the fourth quarter this year, and even if the commodity outlook into 2015 is fairly muted, we are starting to see sort
of on a more macro level some signs of QSR wages re-inflating. Is that something you're also seeing in your system?
And assuming that is a factor in 2015, how should we think about the company's philosophy of accepting that pressure
versus passing it on, and then on the franchise side, really their ability to accept that pressure versus need to pass it on?
<A - Peter Bensen>: Hey, Karen. It's Pete. As we've talked a lot over these last couple years, margins are such a
top-line game for us. So very critical in the margin area that the plans and initiatives that Mike talked about, especially
in the U.S, start to gain momentum and get that traction back on the top-line. Having said that, we are in a relatively
low inflation environment. So pricing, as I noted in my commentary, pricing will still be probably below our average if
you assume the low inflationary environment continues. At the same time, multiple states are increasing minimum
wages. We've got national healthcare impacting 2015 for the first time. That's going to hit the McOpCo margin for
about 20 basis points. So I think the margin in the U.S. will continue to be a little bit pressured by the combination of
less price flexibility and a few of these costs, but long-term, as the sales get back on track and start to grow, that is what
will allow us to start to see the market leverage. And the same kind of dynamics are impacting franchisees' restaurants
as well. As they start to grow guest counts and cash flow, they will start to offset some of these pressures.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about Europe? My greatest area of
curiosity lies with really the heart of Europe. France has been getting softer in recent months, at least I believe so.
Germany has been soft for a while. It doesn't look like, in those markets, you're playing your B game. You've done a lot
of good things there. Are consumer perceptions of McDonald's and fast food changing in Europe or is this purely an
economic issue, and what are the steps you're taking to restore growth? Thanks.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Thanks for the question, David. There are some positives and then there's some challenges
relative to our business in Europe. Some of the positives are, in 2015 we'll see – if you look globally around the system
first, you'll see some good IEO [Informal Eating Out] growth. There are parts of Europe where we'll see a little bit of
IEO growth; i.e., Germany will see a bit projected in 2015. The UK will see a bit.
France is a more difficult market. France is actually projected to have some IEO decline. We have been gaining market
share in both France and the UK, despite some of the difficult broader business or macro environments. Germany,
we've lost some share, and we've talked about Germany in the priority market. What I will tell you is that, as a priority

market, there were a number of changes that Germany has implemented. Some of those I spoke to relative to the actual
team that we have there. Our marketing leadership there. Actually, our agency, we changed out the agency in Germany.
We're seeing a collaboration with the franchisees that is much stronger. So we're making some positive moves in our
marketing plans, our menu plans, and we're seeing some changes relative to how we're addressing the consumer in
those markets.
So I'm feeling as if – I mentioned Germany had a – it seems to be we're seeing some recovery in Germany. We're
cautious as we say it because there are some challenges across Europe, as we all know right now, relative to the euro
itself, but we are seeing some positive things there. But I would tell you it's broadly economic in many of the markets
with the exception of Germany where we have some things to do in terms of our own internal plans. But for many of
the other markets we're gaining share or we're at a point where our businesses are continuing to compete on par with
our competition there. So it will be primarily an economic piece relative to Europe.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question, Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeff D. Farmer>: Thanks. Just following up on an earlier question. What level of same-store sales growth do you
need in both the U.S. and Europe segments to hold on to restaurant level margins in 2015 and you touched on it but do
you have any opportunities in the shorter term to control some of your potential costs on – you mentioned labor but
some of the other costs on the restaurant level line?
<A - Peter Bensen>: Jeff, historically we've talked about a 2% to 3% comp needed to maintain margins in the U.S. and
again, we've – that's been modeled in what we call a normal year. So where you have kind of normal commodity
inflation, normal price elasticity and ability to raise prices, normal wage inflation, et cetera. So a lot of those variables
are a little bit out of whack for 2015. So the price, as I already addressed, we don't see getting to our historical levels.
Wages will probably grow a little faster than normal, especially if you throw in the healthcare impact of that. So again,
as we think about it, especially in this first half of the year, U.S. margins will continue to be a little bit under pressure.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, Peter, on financial strategies, and I guess, first,
as you get into the refranchising program that you mentioned, are you finding opportunities to potentially go deeper?
And I guess the big-picture question is could you take the system to a much higher franchise percentage over time, say
into the 90%s or even approaching 100%, is that even practical? Or are you thinking about it differently? And then
maybe a second part of the financial question would be are there ways to go deeper on some of the G&A cuts? I know
you're reallocating $100 million, but are there other opportunities that you're seeing that might be able to sort of limit
the increases that you'll see this year and into next year?
<A - Peter Bensen>: Thanks, David. First, on the refranchising, we started out with our guidance that said at least
1,500 restaurants and we feel comfortable in being able to accomplish that over the next three years. I'll tell you the
dialog with Areas of the World Presidents has increased around refranchising, and the benefits that that can bring to the
overall business. So we're not committing to a new target by any means, but we also said that after that three-year
period, franchising will continue to be something that we look at and go after. So 100% will never be, but certainly the
ability to continue to increase that franchise percentage over time is something that we will look at.
On the G&A side, I think we've been fairly consistent since we announced our plans for the savings that we believe
there are significant growth opportunities available in this McDonald's Experience of the Future. And, in fact, since we
first started talking about it, we've gotten a little bit more aggressive in our plans to go after that in 2015.
So for the short-term, you've heard us say we don't think we can cut our way to growth in the G&A area and we
recognize these are a fairly significant amount of resources we're reinvesting, but we believe that it's right for the
long-term benefit of the business, as Mike said, to kind of change the customer experience in the McDonald's
restaurants. And as we think about reallocating kind of growth resources by cutting over $800 million of capital
allocated to new restaurant openings and kind of redirecting it toward the McDonald's Experience of the Future, we
think that's an appropriate and prudent thing to do in this environment.

<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Donald Thompson>: John, you there?
<Q - John Glass>: Yes, can you hear me okay? I'm here.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Yes, we can hear you now.
<Q - John Glass>: Okay, thanks. Pete, could you just clarify if the reduction in CapEx is a one-year reduction or you
view this as the new run rate? And what happens to this windfall? Is it upside to the $18 billion to $20 billion in return,
or are you just sort of making up for the shortfall in the cash flow of the business in the last year or so?
And then, Mike, can you just talk about the pricing? I think you said, menu reductions, menu item reductions. Where
are you in that process? Is it hurting sales or have you found it actually is sales-neutral? The same thing for the pricing
adjustments. I think you talked about maybe lowering or adjusting prices. Is it possible to actually see menu pricing go
negative as a result of that?
<A - Peter Bensen>: All right. John, I'll take the first half and Mike will take the second half.
So the cut down to $2 billion, that's not a permanent run rate. I mean, in these markets that we describe, you've heard us
talk about the growth opportunities that exist in these markets. It's a – I'll call it a relatively shorter term readjustment as
we face the realities of the business environment we're operating in. And so think about it as, this is 2015 only, and as
we move throughout the year and regain that momentum that Don talked about, we'll start to realize where the capital
will go in 2016 but keeping that balance between investing in the Experience of the Future and the appropriate level of
new restaurant openings and think about all of this in our $18 billion to 20 billion target.
<A - Donald Thompson>: John, one of the things, and I know there's been a couple of questions kind of around this.
We firmly believe based upon the strength of our business and the reach of our business, as you all know, we touch
about 70 million customers a day. One of the things that we've not leveraged as strongly has been the whole digital
engagement aspect. So as we embark upon the digital strategy, we knew we were embarking upon something that was
going to require us to make substantial investments to get it up to par, to be able to have mobile ordering and mobile
payment, to be able to have promotional offerings that really, really were relevant to customers today, across all age
ranges. And so we have made substantial investments there.
Our focus now is to focus on that in-restaurant experience of our existing base. So if we can improve upon that,
whether that's digital engagement, the physical assets themselves, the way the restaurants look, the placement of kiosks
in the restaurants, our food offerings in the restaurants, that is where we're making substantial investments. This is not
that much different than when we decided that we were going to focus on McCafé at one point, pull back some of the
new store capital at that time, and reinvested it back in existing restaurants. And so we're doing something very similar
as we look at the digital strategies, the in-restaurant experience, and the Create Your Taste and food experiences in the
restaurant.
So as we look at this, we will continue to look at our expenditures, both internally and externally. But we'll also be
mindful where we have opportunities in some of the markets to grow as those markets return to the level of growth and
the level of, I'll say, stability that we think is going to be needed for us to be able to continue our new development
strategies in some of those markets.
Mike, if you would, a little bit on menu.
<A - Michael Dean Andres>: So, John, the menu rationalization that's being rolled out as we speak, we are expecting
to see the same results that we saw in the test markets, which included obviously would be a throughput improvement
because we're making it easier to order for our customers, less complexity in the kitchen. So the time to get the food out
of the kitchen, into the windows, it increases. So we're seeing improved sales results against the control markets in our
tests, and we expect to see that happen in the rest of the country.

I did not speak specifically about pricing, but did speak about value and that the markets are clearly more targeted in
terms of their efforts around value and competitive threats within the marketplaces. So we are seeing more aggressive
disruptive value offers in the marketplace today. As a matter of fact, we are moving to a strategy of more flexibility for
the local markets to price Dollar Menu & More, which is complementing their other value messages, so that the level of
aggressiveness and the tactics can be more reflective of the customer expectations, the specific competitive activity,
and the economic realities of each market.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question, Keith Siegner of UBS.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thanks, and I want to ask a question about Japan, and I realize that it's a relatively small
percentage of the overall operating profits, but it's having a material impact on results. And we've talked about the
strategic rationale for this in the past. And, Pete, what you've told us is keeping that ownership percentage was
important because it lets you influence that business and help to improve it. We've had years of negative same-store
sales, including unit closures. You just mentioned that you expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Is the plan
enough, or since you are there to help influence it, do we need a wholesale restaging of the brand at this point? Where
do we go with Japan? Thanks.
<A - Peter Bensen>: Keith, I think that's a fair question. If you think about the unforeseen events over the last, let's
say, six months, it had a significant impact on the consumer perception of the brand in Japan. And frankly, there were
some concerns about the consumer perception of the brand before these incidents.
And so to your point, I think there is an opportunity here. And in talking with the APMEA leadership and the Japan
leadership, the recognition that there's a clean sheet of paper approach to take a look at what we're doing with our brand
positioning there and how we connect with the consumer so we can improve the trends in our business there over time.
<A - Chris Stent>: The next question is from Will Slabaugh at Stephens.
<Q - Will E. Slabaugh>: Thanks, guys. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the simplification of the
menu. I know you mentioned it's happening right now. I wondered if you could talk about how much further you'd be
willing to go, assuming you do see some improvement here, and if you think that there would be much more room to
take more off of the menu. And then, if you could, contrast that with any potential new menu items that you may
introduce and where they may fall in terms of premium versus value.
<A - Michael Dean Andres>: Thanks, Will. I think this menu rationalization process is clearly ongoing. As we look
forward, we've added quite a number of products over the last 18 months or so. So we're rationalizing that, looking at
clearly what the customers are ordering, what they expect to see. I think moving forward, one of the things that we're
seeing with Create Your Taste, obviously that offers unlimited variety to our guests. They can now choose whatever
they want, so it takes some of the pressure off of a lot of the other menu items that we would have showing on the
menu at any given time.
In terms of the overall menu pipeline and what we're looking at today, obviously food is a high priority. For me
personally, I think that's the foundation of where we're taking the business moving forward and what the expectations
of the consumer are. So we're seeing this localization of more locally relevant products that are being drawn or pulled
from the marketplace as they get into the customer insights. We're looking at building our culinary talent to support our
talented U.S. chefs. We're including our supplier team of chefs. We've got some outside consultants who will bring a
fresh and forward-thinking perspective on our menu vision.
We're looking at educating America on our food, so there's conversation about Our Food, Your Questions, giving them
facts. We've seen 20 million hits on YouTube, 4.1 billion earned media impressions, so that's resonating with our
consumers. And all about the quality story; we have to make sure that our quality aligns with the consumer's definition
of quality moving forward. And so we're going to be very aggressive in that area, looking at – we're working with our
owner operators to revise our product vision for a very different future as led by the consumer from the provenance to
the label ingredients to the processes we use to bring the food from farm to table. We have opportunities to clean up our
ingredient list and enhance the taste.

And as you mentioned, a lot of innovation going on, including Create Your Taste. We're evolving our menu in response
to a lot of the consumer trends. We're launching new products at a national level this year and we're complementing
that on differentiated products at a local level, as I mentioned, allowing the marketplaces to address the specific and the
regional tastes that exist out there today. So a lot of new product news to see in the coming year and the news on our
food in general.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question, Matt DiFrisco of Buckingham Research.
<Q - Katherine Heng>: Hi, this is Katherine for Matt. Can you talk about your comp gap between your December
same-store sales to the overall QSR sandwich category? And also the second part of the question is regarding your
Create Your Taste. Can you comment on this, any incremental traffic that you're seeing? And with the customization, is
it adding another level of complexity to the operations, any effect on the speed of service? Thank you.
<A - Michael Dean Andres>: Regarding the comp gap, clearly that is an important metric for us to follow, and
certainly we have high awareness of that in our marketplaces today. So we're seeing that, we were confronted with
some inflationary pressures that have been well-documented and I think we've kind of lost our focus on the customer
relative to value while the competition became more aggressive. So we are seeing that gap start to improve, be less
negative. Of course, that gap varies by marketplace. We have markets that actually have a positive comp gap. So
obviously we're learning from the things that are happening in those markets. But as I mentioned, our plans and our
tactics in each market, they've got multiple layers which include proactive and reactive targeted tactics against specific
competitive activity.
<A - Peter Bensen>: Specifically the gap for December was 4.1%, negative 4.1%.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Relative to Create Your Taste, clearly we're seeing positive results. We have Australia at a
point that by year-end they will have implemented nearly 900 restaurants on the platform. Again, it is a much more
integrated platform so it encompasses service, it encompasses multiple order points so the kiosk applications, mobile
applications, those things, as well as being able to still approach the business in a traditional sense through the front
counter over through drive-through, we are looking at all aspects of how we bring this new food offering and customer
choice and customization to all the customers who want to experience McDonald's. And so we are seeing some
positives in the markets, clearly, otherwise we would not be implementing this.
I would tell you that from a service perspective, no matter what you implement throughout the years in the McDonald's
system, initially what you're going to see is a slight service decrease in terms of the effectiveness of us being able to
serve in the initial month or two and then that should come right back and we should be able to be even more efficient.
That's the same thing that we've seen with Create Your Taste thus far. So thus far we're very positive on Create Your
Taste but we're also mindful that we need to do this the right way. So we're not rushing to try to implement the U.S.
over a one-year or two-year period. We're looking at the applications to make sure that they get the impact that we want
from a guest count, a sales and an average check perspective which is also a huge aspect as well as the halo around the
freshness of our food and all of our produce. So we're excited about what we see thus far but we're also cautious about
how we continue to implement this across the year.
<A - Chris Stent>: All right, next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you very much. Actually, two follow-ups. The first is on Create Your Taste and what
you're seeing in Australia. I think one of the differences certainly, for example, with France where you've had some
very nice success with some of these initiatives is that the dine-in traffic or the dine-in is a much smaller portion in the
U.S. So I guess the first question is, are these kinds of initiatives less relevant in the U.S. because just the mix of your
business, so much of it goes to the drive-through or even carryout.
And then the second question I wanted to ask was a follow-up on the – when you were talking about improving the
quality halo and the provenance. When I look at the competitive set, what I would call traditional QSRs, there are some
are doing quite well without any of that with, I think, this sort of a core competency around speed and service. Mike,
maybe you could talk about diagnosing that, why some of your very direct competitors seem to be doing well even in
the absence of fitting in with some of these trends about quality and provenance and this sort of the fast casual

direction. Thanks.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Okay. You know, I'll I take both parts, Sara. On the first part, relative to Create Your Taste
and different dynamics or better yet Experience of the Future and different dynamics, because what France is doing is
not an implementation of Create Your Taste at this point. They have implemented multiple order points and now you
can place an order through the kiosk, front counter, table service, web ordering, et cetera, mobile ordering. And when
you look at the table service in France, yes, there is a stronger skew to in-store versus drive-through. However, I will
tell you this. What we do is look at things like that and we will tailor that based upon the market that we're
implementing in. So we already know that in the U.S. with the restaurants that are implementing Create Your Taste that
we've seen very positive results. Therefore, what we're doing is, pulling customers who have a little bit more time and
want to experience the restaurant inside, to come inside the restaurant. We've made tremendous investments in terms of
re-imaging and, actually, we have more customers that are seeing those investments in this environment and with the
offering of Create Your Taste.
So these will be, they will be modeled for the various markets around the world, based upon what is going to appeal to
customers the most. France will not be implementing Create Your Taste at the same pace as say Australia has.
Australia is at a different point with regard to, say, web ordering than France has been. So we'll learn from all of those
things as we bring this forward. But nonetheless, Create Your Taste, table service in France, kiosk applications across
Europe, all of those things have been successful for us. And really, the Experience of the Future aspect pulls them all
together. And so you're going to see some variations across markets, but clearly, we'll look at the performance metrics
to make sure we're moving forward effectively. This is [ph] not unlike (01:00:12), again, McCafé was very different in
Australia than it is in the U.S. Yet, still, McCafé has worked in both.
On the other side, relative to traditional QSRs, I would offer this. No one is really shining that brightly relative to the
traditional QSR space. I think what we're talking about at McDonald's is appealing more to the consumers that are out
there, that are [ph] IEO (01:00:36) customers. So it's not about a QSR thing, or a fast, casual thing. It's about
good-tasting food. It's about affordability. It is about transparency as a brand. It's about a great service experience that
gives me choice. Those are the things that we're putting in place, and those are the things that will help us propel this
business and move it forward. So we're not gauging ourselves by other QSRs, if you would. We're gauging ourself by
the market opportunity and we want to do that.
I would also tell you that, as we look forward at the markets around the world, each of those markets, as we've said
today, is very different and at different places. So they will be able to bring the Experience of the Future to life, in their
markets, relative to their customer bases. But we are not skipping over the existing execution of the core products that
we have, the core menu that we have, core service expectations, quality service, cleanliness. Those things are important
in every single market we have around the world today.
<A - Chris Stent>: We are out of time, so I'll turn it over to Don, who has a few closing comments.
Donald Thompson
Let me just make a couple of comments because it came up a couple times about our franchisees. And thoughts about –
someone mentioned something relative to implementation and franchisees, and how they thought about it. I have to tell
you, the last couple of years, as we've said, have been difficult, but as a global system, all of our system has
experienced quite a bit and endured many unforeseen changes in the local markets. But at the same time, we've charted
and begun to implement a stronger pathway for future growth. I couldn't be more proud of the franchisees we have
around the world. They own and operate 81% of our restaurants. And without them, we would not have been able to
endure those things which we have over the last couple of years. Whether that was geopolitical issues or food-related
issues, our franchisees, along with the employees and suppliers have done a tremendous job and it's that strength that is
going to propel us forward. It's that unmentioned strength, if you would, that we don't often talk about when we talk
about the financials, but it's one of the things that has made McDonald's special, and it's one of the things that will fuel
our growth as we move forward.

I want to thank you all of you for joining us on the call today. 2015, as we've said, will be a year of regaining
momentum. We're making progress as we move even closer to our customers, and as we change to be more relevant
and more progressive. Modern service, genuine hospitality, personal engagement, more relevant customized menus,
and a brand that people can trust, truly trust. This is the McDonald's experience of the future. It is the path that we're
forging, and I will tell you that the future is already on its way.
Our confidence in our brand and the competitive advantages and strengths of our system, are truly a reflection of our
ability to learn from our past, but to also be purposeful and agile in the present, and to strategically plan and evolve
with changing customers' perceptions, attitudes and desires as we move into the future.
Thank all of you for attending and participating on the call today, and have a great day.
