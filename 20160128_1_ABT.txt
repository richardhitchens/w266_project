foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today I will discuss our results for 2015 as well as our outlook for 2016. For
2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year. We're collecting strong double-digit EPS growth when
excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and almost 9% growth on an absolute basis. Excluding exchange, sales grew
over 9%, including strong double-digit growth in emerging markets, and we continued to expand our gross and
operating margins.
Overall we made good progress against our strategic objectives. I'd like to highlight a few key achievements from the
past year. In Established Pharmaceuticals, we completed the sale of our developed markets business and successfully
integrated CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. The integration of CFR provides the scale,
manufacturing and portfolio breadth to establish Abbott as a top 10 branded generics company in Latin America and
actually number one in many of the markets in Latin America. And Veropharm had a similar impact in Russia,
positioning Abbott among the top branded generics companies in this key market. We also made significant progress
improving our commercial execution, expanding our local product portfolios and driving awareness of our Abbott
brand with patients, physicians and pharmacists.
In Nutrition, we achieved double digit growth and share expansion in China with a portfolio of pediatric nutrition
products that are customized to meet local preferences. In the US, we expanded our product offering in the tolerance
and up-age categories with a portfolio of non-GMO products, providing parents with additional formula choices. Our
international adult nutrition business achieved another year of strong growth as we continue to build and shape this
category globally, and we achieved another year of significant margin expansion.
In Medical Devices, MitraClip achieved sales of more than $250 million, and we further solidified our leadership
position in the transcatheter mitral valve repair market with the acquisition of Tendyne and an option agreement to
acquire Cephea Valve Technologies. Along with MitraClip, these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our
leadership position in this attractive segment of the market.
In medical optics, we continue to launch a number of innovative products that are driving growth and share expansion,
most notably in the premium lens segment. And in diabetes care, we introduced our revolutionary Flash Glucose
Monitor FreeStyle Libre in several countries throughout Europe. Consumer response to this product continues to be
very positive, and we recently expanded capacity to meet the growing demand. We also made progress during the year
to bring the Libre technology to the US with the regulatory submission for the approval of Libre Pro, our professional
use device, in June of last year.
And finally in diagnostics, the combination of commercial execution, high quality platforms and customer focused
solutions resulted in another year of above market growth across both developed and emerging markets. This business
also achieved another year of margin expansion while simultaneously investing in the development of next generation
system platforms across all three of its segments including the core lab, molecular diagnostics and point of care
diagnostics.
So we're entering 2016 with good underlying momentum. Our businesses are well aligned with favorable long-term
trends, including the continued expansion of healthcare in emerging economies. While there has been some softening in
these economies on a macro basis, national policies focused on expanding access to care and favorable demographic
trends are driving growth in healthcare that is outpacing overall economic growth in these markets. The fundamentals
of the markets and geographies where we compete remain strong, and we expect to deliver another year of strong
double-digit underlying earnings growth in 2016.

However, a couple of items are impacting our growth outlook on an absolute basis, and you've heard this all week,
most notably foreign exchange. The rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several emerging market
currencies beginning in the third quarter of last year means that foreign exchange will again be a growth headwind in
2016. We are now entering the fifth year of this dollar bull cycle. While we actively work to mitigate the impact of
currency on our results, the impact of exchange on our bottom line will be more pronounced in 2016 due to the mix of
currency movements and certain timing effects. In preparing our 2016 forecast, we were mindful of finding the right
balance between managing through these transitory currency dynamics in the near term while concurrently making the
right choices and appropriate investments to drive sustainable long-term growth.
The other notable impact to our 2016 outlook relates to Venezuela, which has been a good market for us for many
years. As many of you know, market conditions in Venezuela have become more challenging, including high inflation,
increasing price and margin controls, regulations on imports and slowing demand. As a result, our forecast assumes a
significantly lower contribution from Venezuela operations in 2016. Brian will provide more specific details on the
impacts of currency in Venezuela in a few minutes.
So for 2016, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 reflects another year of strong double
digit underlying earnings growth offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from
Venezuela that I just mentioned. In this environment we remain focused on what we control, our commercial and
operational execution, our innovations and our efforts to expand margins.
In Nutrition, our R&D organization continues to be highly productive and is now developing new products closer to
our customers than ever before, with the opening of several new R&D centers in Asia over the last several years. We
expect continued growth and share expansion in China, Latin America and other priority markets, including another
year of strong international adult nutrition growth. And while we've made great progress expanding margins in this
business, margin improvement remains a key priority, and we continue to see opportunities for steady expansion going
forward.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, our execution has improved significantly, and we're focused on strengthening our
capabilities in key channels and geographies and building a well-recognized Abbott brand with consumers to take a
prominent role in making decisions about their healthcare. Internal development programs and local product
acquisitions are driving a steady cadence of new products in our Established Pharma business to strengthen local
portfolios. In 2015, our productivity at new product launches increased versus the previous year, and we expect another
strong year of new product launch productivity in 2016.
In Medical Devices, we expect continued growth and share expansion in our cataracts business, driven by the ongoing
launch and market uptake of our premium intraocular lens products across multiple geographies. In diabetes care, we
recently expanded capacity, as I mentioned, to meet the strong demand for FreeStyle Libre in Europe, and we expect to
bring this technology into a number of new markets in 2016, targeting in the multi-billion dollar global blood glucose
monitoring market. And in vascular we'll continue to drive uptake of MitraClip and expect to bring Absorb to new
markets through the year.
Finally in Diagnostics, which remains one of our most consistent growth businesses, we'll continue to execute our
commercial strategy to drive above market growth in both developed and emerging markets. And as we progress
through the year, we look forward to providing more specifics regarding our next generation diagnostics systems
platforms as we get closer to launch.
Before turning it over to Brian, I'd like to comment briefly on capital allocation. You always ask me about that, and you
know that we take a very balanced approach here, which for us includes increasing our dividend, share repurchases and
M&A activity. Last month we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 44th consecutive year
we've increased our dividend. Abbott's one of only a handful of companies to deliver with such consistency. Share
repurchases have and will continue to be part of our capital allocation mix.
And lastly, while 2015 was relatively quiet for us on the M&A front, adding to our business with good M&A remains a
key priority. We see a number of opportunities, and we'll continue to remain active on this front. As always, we remain

disciplined and focused on finding the right balance of strategic fit and measures of return that will benefit the
long-term shareholder. I'm sure you're going to have a question for me later on that topic.
But overall you can see cash flows remain strong. Margins remain strong. The underlying growth of our businesses
remain strong. In summary, the fundamentals of the markets and geographies in which we compete all remain strong,
and we continue to focus on what we can control. For 2016 the impact of foreign exchange and the Venezuela
dynamics I mentioned earlier are offsetting double digit underlying earnings growth. These impacts, while significant,
are transitory in nature and therefore we remain focused on making the right decisions to drive long-term growth for
our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss 2015 results and the 2016 outlook in more detail. Brian?
Brian B. Yoor
Okay. Thanks, Miles. Today we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of
$0.62, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by
strong performance in our branded generics, Diagnostics and adult nutrition businesses. Reported sales declined 3.1%
in the quarter, including an unfavorable impact of 8% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was
approximately 1.5 percentage points higher than previous expectations, due to the continued strengthening of the US
dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter.
The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.2% of sales, up 130 basis points over 2014, driven by continued
margin expansion in Diagnostics and Nutrition. In the quarter, adjusted SG&A expense was 29.6% of sales and
adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales, reflecting investments in development programs across the businesses,
including several next generation diagnostic system platforms.
The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was somewhat below our previous forecasts due to inclusion of the impact of the
US tax legislation enacted in December.
Overall, as we look at 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year despite a difficult environment, and we
delivered strong underlying growth while continuing to make significant progress on our margin initiatives.
Turning to our 2016 outlook, today we issued guidance for our adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.20. While this
forecast reflects another year of strong double digit underlying earnings growth, foreign exchange and the Venezuela
dynamics that Miles discussed are impacting our 2016 absolute growth outlook. Let me take a moment to provide more
detail on each of these items.
As you know, in the third quarter of 2015, several emerging market currencies weakened rapidly relative to the US
dollar and have continued to steadily weaken since that time. Based on the geographic mix of currencies that weakened
and the rapid pace at which these currencies declined, foreign exchange will be a greater offset to our underlying
earnings growth in 2016 versus 2015.
Additionally in 2015, our hedging program served to mitigate some of the underlying foreign exchange exposure and
volatility. While our program remains in place for 2016 and is anticipated to deliver some offsetting impact to our
exposure, the benefit of our hedges have naturally lessened over time. So the fall through from translational foreign
exchange combined with these hedging dynamics negatively impacts EPS growth in our guidance by a little more than
10% for the full year of 2016.
Lastly as Miles mentioned, due to challenging market conditions in Venezuela, our 2016 forecast assumes a
significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations. This impact lowers our 2016 sales growth rate by almost
2%. And excluding this impact, the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range would reflect adjusted earnings per share
growth in the mid-single digits, even with the more pronounced foreign exchange impact I discussed earlier. As the
year progresses, we'll provide any relevant updates on our business in Venezuela.

I will now provide more specifics for our 2016 outlook. For the full year 2016, we forecast operational sales growth in
the mid single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact of around 4% on our full-year
reported sales, which would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016. Scott will
provide more detail on the 2016 outlook by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 57% of sales, reflecting the negative impact from exchange but
partially offset by underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D
investment of somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year.
We forecast net interest expense of around $125 million, up over 2015 primarily due to higher US interest rates and
lower forecasted interest income in certain countries.
We forecast a loss of approximately $25 million on the exchange gain loss line of the P&L for the full year, and we
forecast around $10 million of non-operating expense for the full year of 2016. We forecast an adjusted tax rate of
somewhat above 18.5% for the full year of 2016, similar to 2015 and reflecting the effect of the US tax legislation
enacted in December.
Before I review our first quarter outlook, I'd like to provide some context for our forecasted pattern of quarterly
earnings growth in 2016. We forecast underlying adjusted EPS growth in the double digits for each quarter of 2016.
However in absolute terms, both foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics will have a more pronounced impact
on our results in the first half of the year. We expect the pace of both sales and adjusted EPS growth to progressively
accelerate throughout the year.
So for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.40, reflecting double digit underlying
growth, which is more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution from Venezuela
operations. We forecast operational sales growth in the low single digits and at current exchange rate we'd expect a
negative impact of exchange around 6%, resulting in a reported sales decline in the low single digits. The Venezuela
dynamics that I discussed lowered our first quarter operational sales growth forecast by around 3 percentage points.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above
7% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 34% of sales in the first quarter. And we forecast net interest
expense of around $25 million in the first quarter.
In summary, we achieved strong growth in 2015 despite a challenging environment. Our businesses enter 2016 with
good underlying momentum, and we continue to execute well on our margin expansion initiatives. Our underlying
earnings growth forecast has forecasted to remain strong in 2016, very similar to the underlying earnings growth we
saw in 2015.
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Scott?
Scott Leinenweber
Thanks, Brian. Today I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter sales performance and 2016 outlook by business.
As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales
increased 7% in the quarter. In core laboratory diagnostics, international sales increased nearly 8%, driven by double
digit growth in emerging markets. And in the US, we continued to achieve above market performance with growth of
more than 6%.
In molecular diagnostics, sales grew 3%, led by strong growth in our core focus area of infectious disease testing. As
expected, US sales were impacted by the planned scale down of our genetics business. And lastly point of care
diagnostics, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter. US and international growth were driven by continued
market adoption of i-STAT, our handheld device which provides critical information at the patient's side, helping
healthcare providers choose the best treatments in a variety of care settings when minutes matter the most. In 2016,
we'll continue to leverage our best-in-class commercial model and provide customers with a full offering of solutions to
help them most efficiently operate their businesses while improving care. We expect global Diagnostics sales to

increase mid single digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016.
In Nutrition, global sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. Pediatric nutrition sales increased approximately 4% and were
led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac Advance non-GMO in the US. As expected,
international pediatric nutrition results were impacted by a difficult comparison versus the prior year, when sales
increased more than 20% driven by market uptake of product launches in China and Southeast Asia. In adult nutrition,
sales were led by 10% international growth, including double-digit operational growth in several Latin American
countries. US performance was led by growth of Ensure in the retail and institutional segments of the market.
In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on capturing share with locally relevant pediatric nutrition products and
growing and shaping the adult nutrition category globally. For the full year 2016, we expect global nutrition sales to
increase mid single digits on an operational basis. It's important to note that the Venezuela dynamics that Miles and
Brian reviewed most significantly impact our forecast for Nutrition and Established Pharmaceuticals. Excluding this
impact, we forecast operational sales growth for our global Nutrition business will be mid to high single digits for the
full year 2016. For the first quarter, we're forecasting global Nutrition sales to increase low to mid single digits on an
operational basis.
In Medical Devices, as expected, vascular sales were relatively flat for the quarter. MitraClip, our first-in-class device
for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, once again grew strong double digits, and Supera, our innovative endovascular
stent, continued to perform well. This growth was mitigated by market dynamics in the coronary stent market. In 2016,
we'll continue to drive market uptake of MitraClip and Supera and expect to bring Absorb, our fully dissolving stent, to
the US market. For both the full year and first quarter of 2016, we expect global vascular sales to decline low single
digits on an operational basis.
In Diabetes Care, sales growth was again driven by strong international sales of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. In 2016
with our recently completed capacity expansion, we look forward to bringing this breakthrough technology to more
consumers around the world. For the full year 2016, we expect global Diabetes sales to increase double digits on an
operational basis. For the first quarter, we're forecasting global Diabetes sales to increase mid single digits on an
operational basis.
In Medical Optics, global sales increased 2%, our strong performance in the cataract business, notably in the premium
lens segment, was partially offset by dynamics in the refractive market. In 2016, we'll continue to drive uptake of our
innovative premium intraocular lenses, and we expect global medical optics sales to increase low to mid single digits
on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016.
And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales again increased double digits. Sales growth in the quarter
was led by strong performance in several markets, including Russia, India and China. For the full year 2015, EPD sales
grew double digits operationally with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. In 2016, we'll continue to broaden
our portfolio with locally relevant new products, we remain focused on successfully building our presence and scale in
key countries of focus.
For the full year 2016, we expect EPD sales to increase mid to high single digits on an operational basis. As I
mentioned earlier, Venezuela has a significant impact on our forecasted EPD growth rate. Excluding this impact, we
would forecast operational sales growth for EPD in the low double digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter
we're forecasting EPD sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis, reflecting double-digit operational
growth excluding the impact of Venezuela.
In summary, we achieved another year of strong underlying sales and margin growth and are well positioned to
maintain that type of momentum for the full year 2016. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator?

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from
Mr. Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Good morning, everybody. Let's start with Venezuela and maybe you could just give us a
bit more in terms of what you're doing, one, with your operations there, and two, the change you're assuming, it sounds
like you're marking-to-market the business basically at different exchange rates. So could you just walk through
financially what you're doing and why that's flowing to the business as much as it is 2016?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, Mike, this is Tom. I'll talk about what's going on for us in the country, but I want
to make it very clear that we're not changing our exchange rate assumptions for the country. This is really about what's
happening to the markets through economic activity of those markets and really demand and ability to pay for products.
Oil price was high at the beginning of the year. It declined throughout the year, and the markets became more
challenging. And we saw, as Scott talked about and Brad talked about, significantly lower volume as we exited 2015.
And as Miles indicated in his remarks, with price controls, very high inflation, and when we look at the remainder of
2016 going forward, we see very challenging conditions and much lower volumes in the country. So we're focused on
supplying the market, more focused on medically critical products. Our products are important to the market, but just
the profitability of what we would expect for the year from that activity is a very low contribution compared to what we
experienced largely in the first half of 2015. So that's kind of the situation. And I think it's basically, it takes some
volatility out of our forecast and reflects the reality of the market we're dealing in.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay, all right. So two more fundamental follow-ups. So one, the pediatric nutritionals
business had a tougher comp in the fourth quarter internationally off the product launches and particularly in China.
Can you just separate out for us the tough comp versus the underlying growth and degree to which you think you're
seeing any slowdown in any of your markets? Thanks
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Sure, Mike. I would say in international, as particularly in the slowdown that you're seeing on
the surface, nothing has changed about our underlying momentum here. If you go back to fourth quarter of 2014, that
was a period where we were launching our innovations, particularly Eleva and Qinti into the market, and as you know
Eleva has had great success in the portion of the market that it's playing in. So there is a little bit of a tougher
comparison fourth quarter 2015 over 2014. If you blend it out in China though, on the average, our nutrition business
grew over the mid teens for the full year. And so that's more reflective of the performance for this business for the year,
and it's still ongoing. We still have the momentum there. We still have plans for further opportunities of how we
compete and how we bring products to the various channels there. So nothing has changed about the momentum, and it
continues into 2016.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. So Miles, bring you in here, so all this discussion, the underlying business if we can
pull out Venezuela and we can pull out maybe one or two other smaller items, the underlying business hasn't changed,
but the environment has changed in some places and the prices paid – prices for assets has changed. Have your
priorities on the capital allocations and the M&A question, have your priorities changed at all over the last six months?
<A - Miles D. White>: No. Why don't we go back, Mike. I'll characterize that for you. The underlying – as I say, the
frustrating thing, and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are US-based is the underlying
market dynamics remain strong in a lot of places. I mean every morning we get up, we see CNBC, everybody wrings
their hands about China. But whether China is 7% growth or 6% growth, 6% is way bigger than the rest the world. It's a
fundamentally strong market for us, as are practically all of these emerging markets.
Now the oil-based economies, the ones that are extremely dependent on oil, take Venezuela, okay they are a different
story. And the volatility and unreliability of sustainable market there is different than just about anywhere in the world.

So okay, there's an outlier. And every year there's going to be some outlier somewhere. And I think if you're in a broad
mix of currencies and a broad mix of countries and geographies as a multinational, somewhere something is not going
to be great. But the fundamentals of the markets, particularly for us in healthcare are good, and yet translating that back
during this period, it's unusual. It's frustrating. I mean none of us have seen this kind of oil price in a couple decades
and none of us have seen this kind of currency pile on in a long time. So okay, that said, we all know that. Every
multinational CEO has said it in the last two weeks in his earnings calls and we all see it. We're all experiencing it.
Now going back to your next question, has my expectation of our underlying momentum changed. No. Has my priority
changed in terms of M&A activity, I'll tell you one thing about it that's changed a little bit. We've been looking at
properties largely internationally, and I'd say I'm probably balancing that a little bit back another way. I don't think – in
the past I've looked pretty hard at a lot of expansion opportunities in branded generic pharmaceuticals, and I think there
are opportunities there. But I think as you and others, look, we've watched those valuations over the last year when deal
heat churned, and I can tell you that there was one particular one that we were involved in an auction for, and the
valuation that that property went for, we did not win it, but the valuation that property went for was non-economic. I
mean just plain non-economic.
I would challenge the buyer to explain where the economic return was in that particular deal. And they obviously had
their reasons, and they obviously saw something the rest of us didn't appreciate, I would say is an understatement. But
the valuations are at a level in some cases that you have to question prudence. And I think at the end of the day, while
we've got strategic reasons we want to expand our footprint in different places, those valuations when we deploy the
capital on behalf of our shareholders has to make some sense. And I don't think that we are any more – I think we're
prudent. I think we're disciplined. I think we've made good deals in the past. I think I've gone through so much of this
where I've heard we paid too much, we didn't pay enough, we got a good deal, etcetera. But I think some of the things I
saw last year said, boy I don't think I minded losing that one. I don't think I minded not participating in that one.
So I think right now, first of all, I don't see a lot that people are offering up for sale in effect. And the old maxim
everything's for sale at some price. Well the price that some of these things would be for sale at is imprudent. It's just
imprudent. So I think you have to step back and say we're not in that zone. We're not going to be that irrational in some
cases. And that's me. I mean, I hate that I'm going to see some of this in print later, but I think that.
So you look at some of the currencies and some of the weakening of currencies, we would do a lot of those deals in
local currency, in fact, almost all of them in local currency. And I would say based on where those currency rates are
today, you could say it's time. This is the time because there's not as much currency risk in a purchase in that particular
market, et cetera. But I think if I look at the mix of geographies and the mix of currencies and so forth that we currently
have, I'm not sure our investors would applaud further wading toward it just now. I mean I think there's a timing issue
here.
I mean I would tell you having said that, if there was the right opportunity in the right place, and I believed it was
strategically very important to us or a real opportunity for our investors and that the balance of what we foresaw in the
growth of that market, the position, the currency and so forth, if it all lined up and the valuation looked good, I'd
probably do that deal. But that was a stack up of a lot of ifs right now. So you'd say what's changed. I'd say where I'm
looking and what I'm considering, it hasn't changed. It's just shifted in some of its balance. I think that I've got all the
same sort of pharmaceutical opportunities on my radar screen, but I'm prioritizing some others now that are maybe
more important I think in this market, this environment in terms of strengthening our businesses.
Now I've heard other CEOs say the same thing. I've heard a lot of people say – actually I've mostly heard bankers say
that it's a very robust; everybody's out there trying to buy stuff, market. I've heard it more from bankers than from other
companies reporting. I don't think there is that many things out there for people to consider in our spaces. I don't think
there is that many properties. I don't think there's that many assets. I don't think there's that much to consolidate. So I
think it's fairly predictable, particularly for an analyst in this space as you are, to predict the kinds of things that people
are going to be looking at and there's not a lot out there to consider.
So I think for us, we know what our strategic priorities are. We know what can help our business. We know where
there's real pluses and opportunities. And the question is whether or not the other parties, whoever they may be, see the

same sort of opportunity and we can come together on an overlap evaluation and make something happen.
And I know that sounds like text book platitude, but that's really what it is. There's a lot of people at the dance looking
at each other and trying to decide whether they want to dance. But I don't think there's that many opportunities to be
made and everybody is in the same environment where they think their own valuations are low and they look at the
valuations from last year that were kind of high, and I think you're in a zone where people are adjusting to what's my
value.
And so having said all that, am I any less focused on it, no. I'm probably more focused on it if anything. But I'd say
we're also pretty analytical about what we can do with the businesses and what's the right valuation and what's the right
timing and so forth because we don't get swept up in deal heat. We're fairly strategic about it and I know that a lot of
people think that a lot happened last year and we should have been in the mix of it.
But I didn't see anything go by that I felt particularly bad about not being in the mix of. As I mentioned, there was one
particular one we were in the hunt on and the valuation at the end was so high I don't mind missing it at all. So I realize
that's a long ramble story, Mike, but that probably gives you a fair degree of insight into how I'm thinking about it.
We're definitely not inactive, that's for sure.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Understood. Listen, I have follow-ups, but I'm going to let some others jump in. Thanks,

Our next question comes from Ms. Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Ma'am your line is open.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to kind of follow up I guess along
Mike's line of thinking. Maybe talk a lot about more from a geographic point of view. I was just wondering if you
could talk more about the balance of Abbott from more of a business mix point of view. Has the way that you've looked
at the mix of Abbott from that perspective changed over the last kind of year or so, or really since the spin of AbbVie?
And if I look at the growth rates for this year, Medical Devices, the growth operationally was 1.5%. If that division
were to be separated out, I just look at Abbott and it would be even stronger as a company. And how you think about
that franchise and strengthening it or just kind of the composition of Abbott today? And the future.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I think I'd start with I'd be all about strengthening rather than separating out. But we're
committed to all four major segments that we have in the company. One of the important things about those segments
is that they are in relative balance in terms of size, sales, profitability, et cetera. They've all got somewhat different
dynamics, and they've also got a lot in common.
If you took EPD and Nutrition globally, they share a lot of channel dynamics and so forth, Devices, Diagnostics too.
And there's a lot of different things going on with these businesses. But I'd say first is balance matters in the mix that is
the investment identity of a company for an investor, because you want to be a reliable performer steadily over time.
And as you know, our proprietary pharma business fabulously grew to a terrific size, and based on one product in
particular, and so we were out of balance as a company, and so we split into two companies. But we've got balance in
these businesses.
That said, I'd say from an M&A perspective in the places where we're looking, to be perfectly fair, we're not looking to
do anything with regard to M&A in our Nutrition business today. I mean if something came along opportunistically,
we'd look at anything. But the fact is that business is, that's an organic business for us. And all of our performance
objectives and the things we want to do in the Nutrition business globally are organically driven, and we think we're in
a good position for all of that. So the kind of investments that we'd make in the those businesses are more capital, plant
and et cetera in the right markets of the world, and managing supply chain and so forth.
The other three businesses are each a different tale. Diagnostics, I'd say we got a very strong business here. It's actually
a diverse business, a lot of different segments of diagnostics, and if we opportunistically could add to it, we would.

Obviously all the criteria you'd look at have to make sense. But that's a business where we don't really have to, but if
we had opportunities, we look.
EPD, similar. We've got a gem of the business there. And having done a lot of things to shape that business in the last
several years, we are in the right growth markets. We're in high-growth markets. We're in markets where the
profitability and the market development, the retail facing, it's all the structural and channel dynamics for a brand of
generics are good. We've identified, let's say in priority, 15 countries in particular that meet all our criteria. And we've
got strong positions in most of those particularly important ones, and we're always looking to enhance our footprint in
those markets if we can and expand our brands in those markets. Latin America was a great example of that. And so
there is still many geographic opportunities to do so.
But I always make the distinction for investors and others that it's really where we can distinctively differentiate
branded generic pharmaceuticals, which means retail and channel and so forth, like India and other Latin American
countries and so forth. And so when we have those opportunities, it's great to add on, but what we've got as a core
business now is a very strong branded generic, international, largely focused on emerging market business where
there's a tremendous tailwind of market growth. So that's another one that's opportunistic.
And then Devices, I'd say it's some of both. We look at that one; we'd always want to strengthen that business. We do
wish to strengthen that business, but a number of ways we're doing that. Obviously there's organically in house, and
then there's our venture organization, where we're building a number of small companies or investing in other
early-stage companies and so forth and building our pipelines for the future. And then finally, if opportunistically
there's available opportunities where it fits our market segments and so forth, then there's always M&A. And so we're
always mindful of those opportunities, too.
But that gives you a sense of how we think about each of those segments. If you said, well would you think about
something completely unrelated, different, probably not. There's too many opportunities to build or strengthen the ones
we have, and their needs from a strengthening standpoint vary. Some have more need to have more breadth of product
than others, and some it's purely opportunistic, Kristen.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then just thinking about, I know one of the areas that you'd highlighted earlier
was building out the capacity for FreeStyle Libre. What about the US timing for that? And is that going to be a
consumer product or is that just going to be more of the physician product?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I think it depends on what timeframe you're asking in. It's going to be both eventually. I
mean right now I want the fastest regulatory path possible. This product has been exceptionally well received in
Europe, spectacularly well received I should say. And consumers and users and diabetics and so forth have just given
us an overwhelmingly positive response. So that's good, and we're just in the process now of releasing of all the new
capacity we invested in in the last year and we got the next wave of capacity expansion underway.
So it's kind of one of those great challenges where I'd say from my own perspective, the diabetic community in the
United States wants this product. And it's a regulatory pacing issue here. It wasn't so in Europe, and I would say no
more about that. But I'm in a hurry, because we know the value of the product. We know the reception of the product.
We know what the physician community reception of the product is. We know all of that. And the value proposition of
this product on top of the medical proposition is just fabulous. I mean I have great expectations for it. I'm excited about
it, and there's sort of two dimensions of that. One is enough capacity which for a while we'll have and then we'll have
another tranche coming on, and the regulatory process for how fast we can go.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Any sense on when the first product could hit market in the US?
<A - Miles D. White>: I'm one of those superstitious people that no matter what I tell you, I'm going to be wrong. And
so I don't want to jinx anything. So I would just say, I would optimistically hope toward the end of this year, but I don't
know.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much for your questions.
<A - Miles D. White>: You bet.

Operator
Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Miles, first question is on the Mylan stake. I'm wondering if
you could give us an update on the stake and what you're thinking is. I know in the past you said you're not going to be
a long-term holder. Are you any closer to selling that stake and will the sale be associated with some M&A? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, the good news is we really don't – you're right. We're not going to be a long-term
shareholder of Mylan. But the good news is we don't have to sell it right away. We have the freedom to sell it. We just
don't have an immediate reason to have to. So I'd say we could leave it in Mylan shares or we could leave it in cash,
either way. And you asked would it have something to do with M&A. Well, obviously that might trigger it. I think it
depends on what the price of Mylan is in the market and the manner in which we might market our shares and so forth.
And there's a couple of dynamics there, but I would confirm, no, we don't intend to be long-term Mylan holders, and
well, the only thing holding us back is probably trigger of M&A activity, maybe a little valuation.
But we're not particularly hung up on value right now. We did watch the entire Perrigo process and so forth pass, and
thought until that stabilized and was finished, there was no point in being in the way of that. So that's happened. That's
stabilized. That's finished. There is a stable market now for Mylan shares and we'll just wait and see what triggers it.
But we otherwise have no reason to move one way or the other until there's some trigger like M&A, I would guess,
Glenn.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay. Let me follow up for a second.
<A - Miles D. White>: If the price were to rocket north, we'd probably view that as a trigger too, to be obvious.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay. Let me ask a specific question on your vascular business, because if you strip out
currency, I think over the last 12 months even going forward, most of the businesses are on track, at least performing in
line with our expectations. But the vascular business continues to come – at least relative to our expectations, continues
to come in below. And I know you highlighted Absorb, but a lot of our channel checks are not very positive on Absorb.
So I guess my question is what's the commitment to this vascular business? Is this a business that you need to build up
through M&A? And is the reason why we haven't seen a lot of M&A is it because the targets have still unrealistic
valuations? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I'd say a couple things. First of all, we're committed to the business, and I think there's a
bigger market condition here. If you look at the markets around the world, not just the US, but literally every major
country in the world, the markets have stabilized among competitors. Share doesn't move a lot. If it does, it moves a
little. You know, the physicians in this space, they take a new product and they experiment with it a little bit and that's
about it.
The innovation here is at a point where I'd say the incremental value recognized by the healthcare system is limited. If
you think about what drug coated stents and so forth have done in the vascular space, it's been a tremendous boon to the
treatment of patients. But I think now what we see is this market is far more driven by cost than price as either
countries or hospital groups and others try to manage the overall cost of healthcare. So I think all of us see the same
dynamics where we're increasingly challenged on more value proposition than just innovation. And I think increasingly
the payer, whether it's a government or the purchasing people or insurer or whatever it is, are increasingly more
influential here than the preference of physicians.
So you'd say, well those aren't very good dynamics. We'll, they're not bad dynamics either. It means we have to
compete in this business just like we compete in a lot of other businesses. And I think we, and our competitors in this
business are all broadening our product lines, or innovating in other surrounding spaces and broadening those offerings
in the space. But there's still a lot of room for innovation, but it may not be specifically just on the stent.

So what behooves us is to expand our business, and to some degree or to a large degree, that is M&A. And in our case,
it's been a lot of small ball M&A, and looking to expand around those businesses, MitraClip, Absorb. Those kinds of
things are incremental, although MitraClip is fairly significant that way. We look at expanding into structural heart or
heart failure or other categories, and we're trying to build our breadth in those other let's say surrounding spaces that
way. I don't think that's very different for any of the companies in this business worldwide.
I mean I think what's been difficult for any market that had the kind a robust innovation driven growth that this one did
back in the early 2000s, it's a different market today. It's a different market everywhere today. So is it a slower growth
market, yes. Is it still a very attractive market, yes. It's still a very profitable market for all participants and that's why it
gets a lot of pressure from a cost standpoint from the payers, etcetera, and I don't think that's a secret to anybody.
So while others look at the performance of the business and say, gee, it's a little below our expectations, I'm beginning
to think it's just all of us adjusting our expectations to sort of the reality of the value propositions in the market today.
And so I think it's a very strong business. It's a very healthy one, at least in that respect. We still invest quite
substantially in R&D and innovations there, and clinical trials and so forth. We've got innovations that are in R&D and
in the clinical space and a lot of investments around it. So would it benefit from a much broader footprint, well it
probably would. The question is how to get to that broader footprint.
And I think that in the, call it medical device space broadly defined today, there is either a bunch of big companies or a
bunch of little companies. There's not much in the middle, and the couple of things in the middle are extremely highly
valued relative to their current performance, and I think there's a lot of speculation or question about whether or not that
kind of value will play out. So I think it will involve a little time here. We've made a lot of investments in smaller
companies and segments, as you know, whether a Tendyne or Cephea or others to expand our footprint here. So I
believe in the medical device space right now and long term, but I don't think it will be the same kind of space it was
10, 15 years ago.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: You had mentioned priorities. Is vascular higher up on your priority list now?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, that implies it wasn't before. I would say the device space has always been high on my
priority list, and whether it's in the vascular space or the optic space or whatever, this has been high on my priority list
for a while.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay. Great. Thank you, Miles.

Our next question comes from Mr. Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one clarification question and then two
real questions. On the emerging market growth in Q4, can you give us kind of the organic constant currency growth for
this quarter, please?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Yes, Larry, if you look at the quarter and you take out the impact of, as we talked about a little
bit slowing of Venezuela through the year, we're in the double digit range for emerging markets across Abbott's
businesses. The emerging market momentum...
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Sorry, Brian, that was Q4 2015?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: For Q4 2015 and for the full year as well, double digit growth. So the underlying momentum
continues into 2016 here as well.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then so for my two real questions, one is on deal size. Miles,
you've talked about in the past a sweet spot of $5 billion to $7 billion. That's one thing you haven't touched upon this

morning. Any color on that? Is that still the case? And then I had one follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I'd say in reality we've got a lot of capacity. And it just depends, Larry. We've obviously
done a lot of small things and small can be measured a lot of ways. I can remember when I thought $1 billion was huge.
Now people seem to think of that as dinky. We've done a lot of things smaller than that. And so mid-size, I don't feel
constrained at $7 billion. I don't feel constrained at $8 billion or $10 billion. I don't feel constrained. So I'd say, look, if
the opportunity is right, the strategic fit is right and the valuation is right, I don't feel constrained by size right now.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: That's very helpful. And then I hope you understand the spirit of this question, because it's
kind of a question that we'll probably get today. But I was struck by your comment earlier, Miles, when you said every
year there's some outlier somewhere when you were talking about Venezuela. And I think in the past, Abbott would
absorb those outliers. So I guess why not now and what can you do to kind of mitigate that in the future? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I think that's a good question, and I'd say what we always do everything we can to
mitigate. Here's what's different this time, Last year exchange was a strong headwind for any US based multinational
across the board. And I recall at this very time last year from December to now, you'll recall both oil and exchange kind
of hit a kind of sudden hit, except that the oil price drop at that point was a much higher level than where we are today.
But there was this sudden hit in sort of late fourth quarter 2014 and then early 2015, and everybody scrambled to
readjust their EPS guidance for the year to try to deal with what they saw coming as currency or was already
happening. And a lot of companies dialed back the single digit or whatever and laid it on exchange and so forth, which
was valid.
In our case, we said we think we can navigate through it and we did. And we had extremely strong underlying growth
in our markets, as we still do. And it wasn't just double digits, it's been healthy double digit all year long. And so in our
case, we were able to mitigate an awful lot of that exchange all year long and still deliver what was frankly very
differentiated higher growth than many, many of our peers, even multinational peers not in healthcare.
And what we've got now is another year on top of that, okay, of the same sort of thing. And if you look at the exchange
rate graphs, who would have thought these exchange rates could in a lot of cases be even bigger, even bigger exchange
rates, or however we want to translate it, stronger for us here on the other side. And then on top of that, nobody
predicted $25 to $30 oil. That's a curve ball for the whole world. And so when you throw that curve ball in there, it
dramatically unbalances the mix of your currencies because of the oil-based economies where lower oil prices really
affect the underlying performance of a country.
So you take a country like Russia or Venezuela or Saudi Arabia, these are countries that are all strong countries for us.
And to different degrees, they've been impacted by their own oil revenues and therefore their own ability to pay for
products. Now having said that, is Russia still a strong market for us, it is. Do we have the same kind of difficulties in
Russia that we have Venezuela, we don't. It is a fundamentally good market, strong underlying market, et cetera. The
only thing that's not strong is the ruble, which is dramatically weaker versus the dollar than even a year ago. And so
there's this disproportionate imbalance in the pressures in the currency basket, if you will, from a literal handful of
countries where they already had currency translation challenges just like the rest of the world except that they have oil
dependence on top of it, which amplifies it even more.
And when you start stack up all of those things, you'd say okay, could we navigate through this. And the answer is we
could. I can cut a lot of expenses. I can delay a lot of investments. There's a lot of things that frankly I have the
discretion to do, we as a company have the discretion to do and I could then say to you, we'll either have 5% earnings
growth or high single digit earnings growth. But in our judgment, this year is so unusual this way with the ongoing
depth of currency woes and the unusual circumstance of oil prices and its impact on these economies, that I look at it
and say I don't think it's prudent to compromise our ability to go after all this underlying growth for one year.
In fact, it's more prudent to take out Venezuela out of the assumptions. It's more prudent to take that one out and keep
right on going. And I think if you believe in the underlying strength of economies around the world, the ones that are
delivering growth, and if you believe in the underlying growth of healthcare and those economies and you believe in
the underlying growth of all our products at Abbott, and if you believe in Abbott's ability to continue to access all that

growth, then my judgment was, okay I'm going to roll out of the pocket here and take Venezuela out of the
assumptions. I mean if I hadn't taken Venezuela out of the assumptions, I'd be telling you right now that you're going to
have mid single digit growth on the top and bottom line. And you know something, you'd think that was terrific in this
environment. And if you compared it to all the other multinationals in our space, or frankly other multinational spaces,
you'd say you know that's right in there with everybody else.
So in this case we said if I don't want to artificially compromise our investments in a lot of these businesses, whether
it's an SG&A investment or R&D or whatever because of Venezuela. So I think I'm going to take that one out and keep
right on going, because I believe in the longer-term growth prospects of these economies and these businesses, and I'm
not going to compromise that for a couple of quarters of Venezuela.
So at the end of the day, could we manage through it, yes. And you know this. If you look back at even 10 years in fact
with Abbott, we've absolutely been reliable at double digit bottom line and high single digit top line, unlike almost any
other large diverse multinational out there. We've been a very reliable performer that way, in a very diverse world.
So I don't say all that defensively, even though it might sound that. I look at the world and say, man this is like a total
different circumstance than any of us have ever seen. And you have to kind of make a judgment of how far do I go to
push off what we ought to be doing to sort of wait out this oddball storm we're in. And this odd ball storm, I don't know
that anybody – I think there is a lot of people that would project oil prices are going to stay down for a long time, and
yet everyone says, yeah, but what is down. And at what point do these oil-driven economies start performing better,
$60, $70, $50? There's different thresholds where the performance of those economies change dramatically for a lot of
different business in the world, not just us. In our case, healthcare is pretty good no matter what the oil price it. The
dynamics of a Venezuela are unique. They're unique. And even the Saudis, are they still spending on healthcare, yes
they do. It's still a very strong important market or us, and so is Russia and so on.
So I don't know, that's a long roundabout way of saying we made a deliberate decision. It was discretionary. Could I
have made the decision to say I'm going to deliver high single digit earnings growth no matter what, yes probably. But I
would have had to compromise the underlying momentum in ways I didn't think was prudent. For exchange, yes we
can manage exchange. Venezuela, I think it's more prudent to just take Venezuela out of the mix in terms of what our
expectations are, and that's an unusual anomaly.
I mean I'd challenge you back to 2015, we lived through exchange. Can we live through exchange again, yes we can.
Yes we can. And the single biggest difference in our guidance for this year is actually Venezuela. I don't know if that
answers your question or not, but that was my judgment. It's not an inability; it's more of a decision. If you look at our
spending rates and stuff in our go-forward guidance, our spending rates are healthy.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Very helpful. Thanks, Miles.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: We'll take one more question, operator.
Operator
And all right, sir. Your next question comes from Mr. Rick Wise of Stifel, Nicolaus. Sir your line is open.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Thanks for the question. Miles, hard to resist just asking one more question on Venezuela, and I
totally understand the point you're making there. But you sort of said in your last comment that maybe a quarter or two
of headwind. Wouldn't it be more prudent to think this might be a couple of year issue and might be structural? And
then and just as part of that, maybe for Brian, is the simple monkey math on this, I mean you're really growing mid
teens, something like 15%. If Venezuela is a 5% hit to EPS growth and FX is 10%, I mean that's what you're really
growing on a sustained basis.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes, let me deal with your Venezuela question first, and then I'll let Brian wrap up with, close
on what you just said about our growth rates. You could be dead right about Venezuela. I don't know. I don't know. But
here's the difference for us. We're a healthcare company. And among our businesses, there are products that are

medically necessary. And we have to pay attention to medically necessary.
You don't have to lose money all the time. We don't have to be irrational for whatever reason, but we are mindful that
we're a healthcare company. We are mindful that we have medically necessary products. We are mindful that we've
been in Latin America and in Venezuela for decades, and a lot of times in the past in decades, foreign companies have
exited those countries immediately when the economics turned sour. And the long-term commitment to that continent,
the governments of those countries and the healthcare systems of those countries, they know that and they recognize
that. Abbott's never done that in 90 years in Latin America, and we are a fundamentally large healthcare provider in
Latin America.
So our judgment was we'll make these decisions one step at a time as we see how circumstances develop. It's a pretty
big decision that we've taken just to say we're going to take the sales and profit expectations out of our expectations for
the year so that our investors, frankly you're getting the news today that we're taking it out of our expectations, right.
And yet all I'm trying to do here is derisk your expectations, derisk your riding the roller coaster of volatility here with
that particular country because that one's unique. And so we've just chosen to take it out of the estimates because we
know we're going to continue to have medically necessary products there. But that's going to be in our view at a much
lower commercial level than in the past.
So for right now, Rick, think that's the right prudent place to be. Could that change, I suppose. Anything can change. I
mean I hope it changes more favorably frankly, but I'm not whistling through the graveyard. I just know they're in a
very tough circumstance as a country and they're volatile. They're unpredictable and it's not a very reliable market as
markets go. So I think this is the right step. You could say well shouldn't you just go a lot further, and I'd say you know,
you could say that if you were just in some common industrial consumer or whatever good, but I don't think as a
healthcare company, you can quite do the same thing. So I think we have to be a little prudent about the medically
necessary part. That's why we're where we are.
And Brian, you can address Rick's final comment there about underlying growth rate.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Sure. Rick, I mean if you think about Venezuela and the decision to derisk this and just assume
for a second that that's your reality, your growth rate, it doesn't change. Your growth rate's actually become better as
you move through time. So nothing's changed about Abbott's growth perspectives. They may even become better.
When you think about what I have said and what you've modeled in 2015, you know that we had mid teens underlying
growth but for the impacts of foreign exchange. And when you take these things that we talked about into account, be
that the derisking of Venezuela and what it means to our earnings as well as the FX, you're going to get right back to
the mid teens.
<A - Miles D. White>: Rick, I think you did a better job summarizing than Brian did.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Thanks, Miles.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay.
