Robert H. Benmosche
Thanks, Liz. And good morning everybody. For those of you who are following the presentation online, go to page 3 if
you would, and we're going to talk a little bit about 2011 and think about where you were a year ago. For us here a year
ago was probably a decade ago but it was actually only 12 months. When we started the year up, we had the whole
recapitalization of AIG with the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury and many of you said I don't think they can make
it. This just doesn't seem right and by the way we were three years early for what it is we were required to do at that
point in time but in fact we closed in January of 2011.
We had some divestitures to continue to reduce the level of debt in our SPB for AIA and Alico and you saw we sold
Star & Edison, a tough sale, but we got it done; Nan Shan in Taiwan, a tough sale, we got it done; as well as selling off
the remaining MetLife Securities so of bring the SPV down to the level we are today, which is well below the starting
point of $26 billion. We had to strengthen our liquidity during the year, continue to get access to debt markets and other
facilities, including banks. As you saw, we negotiated our revolving credit facility for $4.5 billion. We did our
continued capital note. And even ILFC was able to get out there and show its strength in the marketplace to deal with
its credit needs.
But one of the conditions of closing if you recall was we had to raise equity capital. That was a conditional closing that
we could access to market. And we saw in May, we were able to sell 100 million shares of AIG's stock alongside the
treasury's 200 million shares of stock. That demonstrated our ability to access the capital markets, and in fact we were
able to then extinguish the Series G, which was bridged to us until we actually made this accomplishment.
And so in the second half – we finished the first half, and as we started the second half, we told all of you that we're
going from saving AIG to building AIG; that our crisis was over. And so as we focused in the second half of the year,
some of the things we did that weren't anticipated until 2012 – latter part of 2012, we did our senior debt hybrid
exchange. We also repurchased – and have the authorization to repurchase AIG shares for $1 billion that was just done
at the end of the year. So that shows our beginning to do our capital management as we talked we're going to be able to
do.
But when we think about capital management and where we are, one of the things that we anticipate is we will be
regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is our assumption. And therefore, we're doing everything we can
to make sure what we do put in the disciplines and be ready for them when they arrive. One of the things they do
require is stress testing. And so we made our best guess as to how you would run the stress test. We don't have all of
the information; they haven't given us direction on what to do, but in attempting to understand what they announced
recently, we've run a stress test of AIG assuming we've got most of the major pieces correct.
We wanted to understand where our Tier 1 capital was and seeing if that's a binding constraint on capital management.
What we found is, okay, you have to have 5% minimum and maybe 1.5% on top of that to be a SIFI. We came out in
the 8% range of Tier 1 capital, which means, if we got it right in terms of our interpretation of the rules and we got
some other things right in terms of how we attempted to execute it, we could have as much as $10 billion of extra Tier
1 capital in this company. And we said we're over-solvent for capital early on because we want to make sure that
people understand we are financially strong. That doesn't mean it's $10 billion that we are going to put to work right
away, it just says that Tier 1 capital looks like it may not be a binding constraint.
What is a binding constraint is the operations of this company, our ability to generate cash and as you can see in 2011,
we generated almost $3 billion of dividends out of the insurance companies, almost $1 billion in the fourth quarter
alone. So we are continuing to see the cash flows come in, we are comfortable with our capital ratios right now and so
the real challenge is getting the operating performance right for this company. You see that in the fourth quarter.
We also had to deploy a lot of cash in 2011 because we had a huge pile of cash beginning the year because we thought
we're going to buy Maiden Lane II. We have succeeded in putting all of that cash to work throughout the year. You see
that in our income in the fourth quarter, so you see the evidence of that money working. We've been asked a lot of
questions about how much of Maiden Lane II did you get, so I might as well just answer it so that you don't keep
asking it. Up until now – there is one more tranche to go but up until now while we have added a lot of mortgage

backed securities to our asset class that we have for the general account and so on, we have only purchased just under
$2 billion of the assets coming out of Maiden Lane II. As we shared with you through the year we had found that other
institutions that wanted to reduce their risk-weighted assets, we were able to find some pretty good product, better
quality credit and a pretty good yield. So that's what we chose to do instead of competing for pieces of Maiden Lane II.
We felt more comfortable with the whole thing but if we didn't get the whole thing we were very careful about what we
bought within the Maiden Lane II. So just want to put that to bed if I could.
So our crisis is over. We had a good 2011. A lot of people say you made it, but – there is a but, so let's go to page 4.
What are some of the buts that I keep hearing. But it's a soft market. Chartis has to operate within the soft market. Rates
not coming back; you have heard us say throughout the year that we are now working hard to get – at least earn our
cost of capital, Peter has talked very eloquently about risk adjusted profitability and we've got to look at the risk we are
writing and do it in a more holistic way because our new organization allows us to do that. So you can see we got rate
4% in U.S., Canada, Workers Comp and we have been talking about issues in Worker's Comp now for the last
year-and-a-half. The market is beginning – our competitors are beginning to see the financial effect of that but when
you look at Workers Comp & Property, up 8%. So we are getting rate.
But the reserves, we are concerned about the quality of the reserves, and you see in the fourth quarter we added about
$13 million to the reserve. So on a year-to-date basis we added about $195 million to the reserve. When you think of
that $195 million for the year and again you saw it throughout the year it wasn't a surprise in the fourth quarter. When
you think about that keep in mind what percentage that is of a $71 billion reserve. It's very infinitesimal. So we are very
confident as we look at our reserves, we're still and many of our products above the central estimate of the outside
actuaries. We've got a lot of people focusing on our claims, our claims process and our reserve process. So I don't know
what more we can do other than give you another year to see that the reserves are in very good shape.
Can we generate cash flow to do capital management; that was a big piece along with the DTA so that we have the tax
cash flows as we earn taxable income as well as the dividends and so on; as you can see in here a very strong in the
fourth quarter, strong for the year.
But the low interest rate environment, you know the equity markets. Your franchises were damaged. It's tough to make
money in a low interest rate environment. If you look at our ability in SunAmerica, they have performed very well.
Remember it's not just the portfolio rate; it's what your crediting rates are. And yeah, there is going to be some
pressure. But it's not as dramatic as everyone wants to say and then sales continue not at the pace they were because
people still need to save their money. They can't just sit in cash. So look at our numbers, our flows; you can see, we had
net flows again of $673 million, very strong for the year.
But the housing crisis, the housing crisis is going to drag you down. You are in the mortgage business. Look at the
other primary insurers, you got a problem. We have told all of you over the last two years, we have redesigned the way
we write business at United Guarantee. They have a multi-variant model that is extremely successful. We are getting
better than expected returns and in fact the ROEs on the new business we're writing is in the 20% range. So while we
have a housing crisis, we see that pretty much behind this. And you are going to see this business which is now the
leader of the industry continue to pull out with really good numbers as we move into 2012 and 2013.
And so the last but is, but the DTA, it says that you really are not confident about your future profitability. Well, we are
and the DTA comes through and says we have a clear view now that we can use the tax benefits here within the
timeframe that's allowed for them. In fact we think it says that we're well on own way to our aspirational goals, well on
our way. And in fact as we get to 2015 and achieve those aspirational goals, we think we'll probably use up
somewheres around 65% of this DTA on the way.
So net to us is the fourth quarter is a clear demonstration that this company has not only survived, it's got its strength,
it's got its key people and we're moving in the right direction and we're going to continue to build value for our clients,
for our shareholders and have a great place for our employees to thrive in.
So on that note, let me turn it over to David Herzog who will take you through some of the numbers.

David L. Herzog
Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. This morning I will go over some of the highlights for the quarter and
then Peter and Jay will comment on specifically the results of Chartis and SunAmerica. And I'm going to build on
Bob's themes that he set forth.
And I would characterize the quarter as pivotal both for what did happen and for what did not happen. And what did
happen is our core insurance businesses made $1.3 billion despite $467 million of cat losses. What did happen is
SunAmerica had another solid quarter with strong sales, strong flows and driven by growing distribution. What did
happen as Bob referenced is continued capital flows from our operating companies to our holding company for capital
management, which is a key pillar of our long-term aspirational goals. And what did happen as Bob mentioned is we
completed our assessment of the DTA valuation allowance that we set out in our 10-Qs earlier in the year, where we
concluded that it is more likely than not that we're going to realize a substantial portion of our DTAs based principally
on our return to sustainable profitability. And what did not happen is the need for a significant Chartis loss reserve
development charge, in fact loss reserve development for the year and for the quarter were benign.
If you turn to Slide 5, you can see the increase in GAAP net income to $19.8 billion, which included $17.7 billion
related to the reversal of the valuation allowance. Net income per share was $10.43 which included $9.34 per share
from the valuation allowance. After tax operating income which is our principal non-GAAP measure was $0.82 per
share versus a loss of about $16 a share a year ago that included the reserve strengthening. Importantly our GAAP book
value per share increased 18% to $55.33, reflecting the valuation allowance and book value per share excluding AOCI
was $52.69.
Also impacting book value in the first quarter of 2012 but to a far lesser extent than the valuation allowance is EITF
09-G, that's the new DAC standard. In the 10-K we provide the GAAP after tax impact to book value of 09-G and that's
about $3.7 billion or about $1.95 per share excluding AOCI, and that will be recorded in the first quarter. The future
earnings impact of 09-G are largely related to the direct marketing activities at Chartis.
Moving to Slide 6 and core Insurance operations, Chartis pre-tax operating income was impacted as I mentioned by
$467 million in cat losses including $368 million from the Thailand floods. This was a record cat year for Chartis,
totaling nearly $3.3 billion. Despite the cat losses for the year, Chartis delivered $629 million in dividends to the parent
in the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the year.
SunAmerica, as I said, had another strong quarter with pre-tax operating income of $931 million. SunAmerica's results
included a little over $200 million from a favorable legal settlement, which was offset by a little over $100 million
from an IBNR reserve increase that Jay will comment on in a minute.
For both Chartis and SunAmerica, alternative investment returns were weak for the quarter compared to a very strong
fourth quarter a year ago. Total fourth quarter alternative investment income declined by a little over $700 million from
a year ago. Last year's fourth quarter alternative investment returns were roughly 14% on an annualized basis, making
for a tough comparison. For the full year, alternative investment returns were around 7% versus 9% in 2010.
Looking ahead to the first quarter, we would expect the returns to improve sequentially given the fourth quarter
performance and the one quarter lag for our private equity investments. We continue to expect an approximate 10%
annualized return over the long-term for the alternative investments.
Moving to our non-core operations, ILFC reported fourth quarter results of $119 million profit versus last year's loss.
ILFC is benefiting from managing its fleet aggressively. In the quarter, we reported about $40 million of charges
related to airline bankruptcies. As you know, we filed an S-1 last September, which is consistent with our view that this
is a non-core business. ILFC's book value was approximately $7.5 billion at the end of 2011.
One thing I want to share with you is the impact on our book value as it might relate to an IPO or a sale of ILFC. It is
possible that our book value could be negatively impacted. For example if we monetize ILFC at its net book value, our
book value could decline by approximately $2.7 billion or $1.50 per share.

Within corporate, we reported a $484 million gain due to the hybrid tender that Bob had referenced.
Turning to Slide 7, you can see the breakdown of our deferred tax assets for which we no longer hold a valuation
allowance against with the exception of the life insurance capital loss carryforwards for which we hold an approximate
$7.2 billion allowance. We are focused on strategies to capture a portion of the value of this asset but we are retaining
the allowance against this for now. Going forward, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of somewhere between
25% and 30% on our operating income. What is most important about the judgment we made with respect to releasing
the valuation allowance is it signifies our view that we have returned to sustainable profitability.
On Slide 8 you can see the impact of the fourth quarter and the full year from our capital management activities. In the
fourth quarter, our capital management activities included arranging an additional $0.5 billion contingent capital
facility and renewing a $4.5 billion credit facility. We also exchanged $2.4 billion in hybrid securities and began our
share buyback program. We repurchased $70 million of our stock at an average price of $22.75. We expect to complete
the $1 billion authorization in the foreseeable future. Capital management is a fundamental part of how we will run this
company with our goal of maximizing investor returns.
Slide nine highlight parent company liquidity sources of $14 billion at year end. For the full year 2011, our insurance
operating companies paid dividends and note repayments to the holding company of over $3 billion, and we expect to
reach $4 billion to $5 billion this year supporting our ongoing capital management plans.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Peter for discussion of Chartis.
Peter D. Hancock
Thank you, David. Morning, everybody. I have got a couple of Chartis slides in the earnings presentation, but they're
just for your reference. So I'm going to focus on a few notable items from the quarter, and those include catastrophes,
reinsurance strategy, reserves, our geographic alignment, our growth plans, especially in the direct marketing channel.
So, overall, I was pretty pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. Excluding catastrophes, actual business
results are pretty strong as were some of our key performance indicators, reflecting progress in our strategic initiatives
to improve profit, generate growth and better manage our risks.
As David noted, this was a historic year for cat losses. And I must say I'm very proud of how our 11,000 claims
professionals worldwide handled this by working extremely hard to deliver excellent claim service to our customers
and we received a very good feedback on that from both customers and regulators. We continue to consider our claims
organization to be really an important competitive advantage that separates us from the rest of the market.
As I reflect on the level of catastrophe losses in 2011, I'm satisfied with how well our efforts to manage our risk
appetite resulted in a level of losses in line with the industry, if you benchmark it as a proportion of capital, and that's
Chartis' capital, not AIG's. The effective management of our catastrophe exposure is also clearly recognized by the
reinsurance market during our very successful Jan 1 renewal season. Today Chartis has a more efficient blueprint for its
reinsurance strategy through a combination of managing our risk appetite, improvements to the structure of our
catastrophe reinsurance program, and the issuance of $1.45 billion in multi-year cat bonds over the past two years. That
reduces our reliance on traditional reinsurance.
Underwriting results in the quarter included a favorable prior year reserve development of $13 million and for the full
year 2011, Chartis had insignificant net adverse prior reserve development of $72 million. And our $68 billion in held
reserves are regularly reviewed by internal and third party actuaries as part of an enhanced risk management
framework.
Similar to others in the industry, we experienced increased frequency and severity related to the most recent accident
years in primary Workers' Comp. In environmental liability, we saw increases from multi-year policies written in prior
years. These were offset by improvements in excess casualty and executive liability products. Excess casualty,
Workers' Compensation, specialty Workers' Compensation and asbestos, the four lines with the largest reserve
increases in the fourth quarter of 2010, experienced overall net favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Chartis continues to reduce our writings in these lines of business. They represented 5.1% of our net premiums in the
fourth quarter compared to 6.2% in the comparable period in 2010.
Expense trends were consistent with the increase in higher value-added consumer lines, which have higher acquisition
costs but lower combined ratios and from our strategic investments in systems and processes that yield greater expense
savings and improved service and efficiency in the long run. We also expect an additional increase in our expense ratio
in 2012 due to our growth in direct marketing. And I'll discuss that a bit more later.
The fourth quarter premium trends are consistent with our emphasis on profitability and capital optimization. Our mix
of business demonstrates Chartis' flexibility in deploying capital across businesses and geographies, targeting them
where the greatest opportunity for profitable returns exist given current market conditions and our long-term strategic
view.
Our International business was 51% of our total net premiums in the quarter, an increase from 47% in the comparable
period the year before. And on the consumer side, it represented 43% of net premiums compared to 40% in the
comparable period in 2010.
So we're very proud of the leadership we're demonstrating in the marketplace with respect to rates and terms and
conditions. Rates in the U.S. and Canada region increased approximately 4%. Specifically, Workers' Compensation and
Property experienced the most notable increases and they were needed, at approximately 8% increase in both lines.
We recently announced the alignment of our geographic operations within three principal regions, the Americas, Asia
Pacific and EMEA. The new alignment promotes greater operational efficiency and allows us to utilize financial and
human capital optimally. It also provides greater focus on strategic growth economy countries such as China, India and
Brazil among others that are vital to our growth plans.
With respect to China specifically, this has been a very good month for further improving our prospects in that truly
extraordinary country. We've established a long-term strategic relationship with China highlighted by the fact that we're
the largest foreign owned insurer in China, with more operating licenses and premium than any other insurer based
outside the country. This past week, I visited with Vice President Xi Jinping in Washington and thanked him for his
commitment to open up mandatory third-party liability insurance for motor vehicles to foreign invested insurance
companies.
We were also able to renew our longstanding relationship with the People's Insurance Company of China in which we
hold 9.9% equity stake. And third, we celebrated the opening of our new office in Jiangsu province in China. This is
our fifth license in China and the region includes 80 million people with a per capita GDP equivalent to that of a
mid-size European nation. We are well positioned in China and we expect to broaden our relationship there including
through direct marketing opportunities.
Beyond China, we are executing a direct marketing strategy in approximately 50 countries. We are able to transfer our
successful DM strategies in Japan, Korea and Israel to other parts of Asia-Pacific and elsewhere. Even with an increase
in our expense ratio due to EITF 09-G, which we expect to be around a point on our combined ration depending on our
marketing costs, we believe that the DM-related business offers very attractive risk adjusted returns and we're going to
continue to grow that channel.
Let me conclude by saying that I believe that we are very much on pace to achieve our goals by year-end 2015. We also
continue to measure and refine the risk-adjusted profitability of all our businesses and we're directing capital and
resources to optimize profitability where we see the opportunities. We still have work to do, but our people and
platform give me great confidence that we're on the right track.
So next, I would like to hand over to Jay.

Thank you, Peter, and good morning everybody. SunAmerica delivered a solid fourth quarter with improved
year-over-year net flows, sales and base investment spreads. David mentioned the unusual items in the quarter. I just
want to add that the IBNR reserve addition of $105 million this quarter reflected new information about the death claim
verification procedures disclosed in recently announced settlements with other companies, including longer look back
periods and that's what drove that increase.
Taking a look at Page 12, compared to last year, SunAmerica's fourth quarter earnings were negatively impacted by
lower alternative investment returns of approximately 1% in the quarter versus last year's strong alternative investment
returns of approximately 14% annualized, as David mentioned earlier, and to a lesser extent, call and tender income
and the ML II fair value mark. If you just look at those three items alone, the alternative investment change, lesser call
and tender and the ML II mark, that accounted for a $530 million decline from the prior year. Looking ahead to 2012,
we would expect full year investment returns to reflect the benefit of last year's cash deployment and base investment
spreads to be relatively stable.
Sales were strong across all of our product lines and total net flows as Bob mentioned were positive for the fourth
consecutive quarter. We benefited from being reinstated on all distribution platforms and added to some new ones and
surrenders remained relatively stable.
Term life and private placement VUL sales delivered strong fourth quarter results leading to retail life sales growth of
9% and total life sales growth rate of 24% from a year ago.
We think the sustained positive net flows continue to reflect our product diversity. Sales of group retirement products
increased nearly 27% as our focus on individual rollover deposits continued to produce results. However, we do expect
sales of individual rollover deposits to slow in the near term due to the low interest rate environment. Variable
annuities, helped by stronger equity markets in the quarter also showed good momentum with fourth quarter sales up
24% year-over-year and this positive trend has continued into the first quarter of this year.
Our discipline in the VA market has served us well. For example, our guaranteed benefit rider fees remain above
industry averages and we were the first in the industry to index our living benefit fees to market volatility as measured
by the VIX index, reducing our exposure to changes in volatility. And just last month we launched our latest iteration
of a de-risked product with the Volatility Control Fund designed to reduce the impact of market vol on fund
performance. Also in the quarter, our mutual fund sales continued to accelerate due to strong fund performance and
success of recent product offerings. And while mutual funds are not are highest margin products, their modest capital
requirements allow into to contribute to our returns.
Sales of fixed annuities decelerated in the fourth quarter as expected given the very steep decline in treasury rates
between the start of the third and fourth quarters. For example, the base crediting rate on bank sold fixed annuities
declined between 25 and 45 basis points depending on the product structure from the start of the third quarter to the end
of the fourth quarter. And given the current interest rate environment, with base crediting rates on new fixed annuities
below 2% we would expect weak fixed annuity sales trends to continue. Despite that we will continue to actively
manage our product pricing; in particular new and renewal crediting rates. We review new money rates for fixed
annuities weekly and have the flexibility to manage crediting rates on over half of our inforce fixed annuity and
universal life inforce account values.
On Slide 13, we show the general improvement in base investment yields and base net investment spreads throughout
the year driven by our redeployment of cash and disciplined new and renewals crediting rate actions. In the fourth
quarter we saw some impact in base yield from lower interest rates and we would expect additional pressure into next
year all things equal with the rates.
On Slide 14, we assume a continued low interest rate environment and the implications for operating earnings. Given
our current new money rates, our disciplined approach to pricing and active managing of crediting rates, we would
expect our pre-tax earnings to be impacted between really zero and about $10 million this year solely from low rates
and between $65 million and $80 million next year due to the current low level of rates. While the macro environment
does present challenges, we've not changed our view on statutory capital over the next two years which remains strong

Thank you, Jay, and turning to Slide 15, we consider United Guaranty part of our core insurance business and it
continues to be an industry leader in the mortgage insurance market. The company led new business written in the
industry and in the fourth quarter we wrote over $7 billion of new insurance. United Guaranty's fourth quarter included
a $42 million favorable reserve development. I would like to highlight another sequential decline in delinquencies and
the delinquency rate of just under 14% at 13.8%. Reserves remain steady with a reserve per delinquency of $27,000. I
think more importantly, as I would note that we helped over 40,000 families stay in their home.
And finally we've also provided some additional disclosure on non-core assets in the appendix. I would like to highlight
that as a result of the recent sales of Maiden Lane II securities in February that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
senior loan will be repaid in March and as a result AIG will begin receiving payments on our Maiden Lane II interest
this year. Any proceeds in excess of our principal and interest will be allocated 5/6 to the Federal Reserve and 1/6 to
AIG. All proceeds from Maiden Lane II for AIG will be used to repay any remaining balance in the AIA SPV preferred
interest. With respect to ML III, payments continue to come in as expected and amounted to just over $1 billion in the
fourth quarter.
At this time, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to first congratulate you on the disclosure on reserves.
It's outstanding. It creates a lot of more questions, but I think it's what you guys need to be doing. Can you talk a little
bit about the loss emergence trend? You said in the 10-K that you use a shorter term development pattern to set the
reserves for excess casualty. That sounds like a contradiction to me, so maybe you can flush that out. And can you talk
a little bit about what's going on in environmental, so we can be confident it's not a recurring event but a one-time
event?
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Hey, Josh, it's Rob Schimek. Let me start with your question on excess casualty. You
might want to rewind back to the fourth quarter of 2010; it was actually in the fourth quarter of 2010 that we shortened
the period that we were looking at excess casualty trends. It actually resulted in us increasing our reserves in 2010 and
that was us giving more reliance on the development that we were experienced in the more recent years as it relates to
business that had been written previously. And so really we're simply saying we stayed consistent with that time period
that we shortened down in 2010, but it just so happens that the more recent years are showing better results than they
did just a year ago.
The next point regarding environmental, I think I want to highlight a couple of things. There is two pieces of disclosure
in the 10-K that I think people should be making sure they focus on. The first is there is a difference between the
"asbestos and environmental" and then the environmental line of business that we write. So with respect to that, you
might want to take a look at pages 93 and 102 of the 10-K although I am positive, I know that you have in particular
but I think some other people might benefit by taking a look at that disclosure.
What I would note is that, with respect to the disclosure we provide on page 93, we provide a discussion of the fact that
we write environmental business through a profit center referred to as the environmental profit center that sits inside of

our commercial business. You'd note that through the first nine months of the year, we experienced some level of
adverse development in the environmental book of business.
Following that adverse development, we spent a lot of our fourth quarter conducting a ground-up study of the claims in
environmental and our fourth quarter adverse development is the result of a very focused effort to try to make sure that
we were really getting at a claim-by-claim valuation of that exposure. Historically, we have used more traditional
actuarial methods. I think that this is an improvement on what we have been doing historically because in the end the
best way to get to this exposure is really on a case-by-case claims review in connection with the work that's being done
by the actuaries.
I also want to observe for you that this tends to be from accident years 2003 and prior and that most of that business
was business written by this environmental profit center. It was written on a multi-year basis and so we are at this point
in time dealing with those multi-year policies that were written 2003 and prior.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: And then on the policy years 2008 and 2009 which evolve into accident years 2009, 2010
a lot of your most sober critics say that they are worried about the reserves there and there was a little bit of reserve
development on the unfavorable side for those years.
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Yeah.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Can we just go through those and then I will disappear into the queue I guess.
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Yeah, no problem, Josh. I would say that consistent with what you are seeing from other
participants in the marketplace, it's been more so related to the workers' compensation line of business. So it's not
something broad-based across all of the businesses that we wrote in 2008, 2009, 2010 but in particular with respect to
Workers' Compensation we've done we think a very good job of pushing rate in workers' compensation and in
managing our exposure on workers' compensation, that book of business has continued to shrink and it's a place where
we've conducted a lot of work regarding the structural drivers of loss to get our hands around what's actually causing
the losses in the first place as well as using predictive modeling to help us do a better job with respect to risk selection.
And we think we will continue to get better with respect to all aspects of that as we move forward.
<Q - Josh David Shanker>: Well, thank you. The detail is much appreciated.
Operator
We will take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thank you. I just have one question Peter, in Chartis, the expense ratio looked like what
would be – I should say the combined ratio in commercial lines was a bit higher in the fourth quarter. It looks like the
expense ratio was a contributor there and particularly within International. Just trying to understand what happened
there? If you could, thanks.
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Mike, it's Rob Schimek. I will comment on that for Peter.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great.
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Let me start by making a couple of observations. First, as you know, our International
commercial business has a much heavier 1/1 renewal date. So if you actually go back and look at the premium trend,
one thing you will observe is that the earned premium and the written premium relationship changes throughout the
year. So for example, in the first quarter of the year our written premium outpaced earned premium for commercial
International by $700 million, but by the fourth quarter earned premium outpaced written premium, so the exact
opposite, by $400 million. That actually causes a pretty significant in change, a swing in our expense ratio. And you
will notice that it's almost a 10-point swing in the expense ratio from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. That's not
unusual for us; that actually if you go back and take a look over time, you will see that that same type of relationship
existed in the prior year, so that's one point to make.

The second thing I will make observation regarding expenses is, international commercial is really the heartbeat of
where a lot of our efforts are going with respect to some improvements that we're making with respect to our
infrastructure. So we were in the process of a very large SAP implementation, probably the largest and most complex
SAP implementation for a financial services company in the history of the world, occurring in Europe as we speak. In
addition to that, we have Solvency II and a significant legal entity restructuring. So there is truly some additional
expense there as well as typical seasonality.
The last point that I'd make regarding the loss side of the house for international commercial is that it's largely on the
casualty side of the house and we are continuing to use the same kinds of efforts with respect to international
commercial casualty as we do with respect to the U.S. commercial casualty, which is focus really on predictive
modeling, evaluating the structural drivers of losses and pushing for improvement in rates so that we can the
appropriate risk adjusted profitability. So I think it's really the combination of those three items focusing in particular in
the expense ratio in the quarter.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. And I mean if I think about so we're 99.4 for Chartis overall on a full year underlying
combined; thinking about 09-G, I am guessing that's 50 to 100 basis points on total Chartis; thinking about the
migration of the business towards consumer lines, some investments and technology; better pricing that you have kind
of talked about and any loss trends we experienced in 2011. Like how should we think about the basket or that basket
of attributes and as we had look at profitability from Chartis from here? Is it sort of a J in terms of profitability
declining and then starting to pick up or how should we think about that?
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: I'll reiterate the overall observation that Peter made, which is that we certainly believe
we continue to be on pace for our 2015 goals. That will result in different sort of dimensions to the solution. The first
with respect to expenses, you can expect our expense ratio to improve more in 2013, 2014 as we complete some of our
efforts with respect to the investments that I described for you just a moment ago in the international commercial
business.
And with respect to losses I think you should continue to expect that we'll be making ongoing progress and we're really
focused heavily on using the tools and the technical pricing expertise that we are focused on heavily these days to make
sure that that's a continual area of progress. So I think you should – what I would look at if I were you, is I'd look at, are
they making continual progress on the underlying loss ratio understanding that we think we have very strong plans and
a very determined view that we will achieve our expense goals by 2015.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Hi, Rob. I just add a little bit just on the direct marketing, the pace of growth there. Our
current course and speed would add about 0.8 to the combined ratio but I would love to deliver you the news that the
expense ratio impact will be twice that because we have the bandwidth to grow faster than that, because the prospective
ROE on that business is very, very attractive, well above our cost of capital. And so I think that we can demonstrate
that through greater disclosures going forward, if and when we accelerate the pace of our DM spend. But our current
course and speed would be just under a point on the combined from the DM but I think that our way of thinking about
that business is economics, not accounting.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: And what would be the loss ratio on that same basis? What will be the loss ratio impact if
you are getting 80 points of benefit from – or deterioration on the expense side, what's the offsetting impact on the loss
side?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: It's – the combined ratio of that business is in the high 80s depending on the country. So it's
very attractive business. The issue is bandwidth and how much of it you can do how fast and so we are expanding in 50
countries, prioritizing about a dozen and we have extended – extensive experience in terms of persistency, cross-sell,
up-sell ratios from our experience in Japan, Korea and Israel over the last dozen years.
So we have a good framework that applies in many countries. So – but I think that we can give you more disclosure on
that going forward as we fine tune the pace but right now our current pace of growth in that business would add about
0.8 to the expense ratio under the new EITF 09-G.

<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: And I would like to add that one of the things that I have said before and I want to
repeat now is that we have not invested enough in technology to really do the data mining – predictive data mining and
so on that we need to do. And so we're going to continue to see that number flow through the expense ratio. Our issue
here is to really position us well for the future and that is- for example, we have 27 million claim records in our
Workers' Comp area that we never extensively studied. We are now working with Johns Hopkins University to really
understand those claims, what they say, what they mean and how we use that as a standard processing claims and
understanding claims going forward. So we are investing heavily around this so that you will continue to see the pattern
of expenses from now and before continuing. But we did say we would get to $1 billion saved, but time to get 2015 and
we are on track to do that, but expenses are not a driver.
What Peter talks about is having the right growth and the right risk adjusted profitability of that growth and being able
to explain to you if the numbers because of the accounting come out a little different than before, we will make sure
you see what that is. But this is about growing smartly and still leveraging technologies as we do it, which as Rob said,
is going to cost us some money and that's not our driver.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thank you all very much.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Edward A. Spehar>: Thank you, it's Ed Spehar, and then I think Jay will have one question as well. I'm
wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about why you weren't more aggressive with the share buyback in the
fourth quarter. And sort of related question on capital generation, cash flow, the $4 billion to $5 billion of subsidiary
dividends that you see, could you tell us just approximately how that would break down between Chartis and Sun, and
again remind about the uses of cash at the holding company? Thanks.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Go ahead Brian.
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Sure. It's Brian Schreiber, how are you doing? Ed, on the first question about the share
repurchase, keep in mind that authorization was in November. So we had a very short window. We were also subject to
volume limitations on how much we could participate in daily volume and it was our intention to not be very heavy in
the stock on low volume days. So that's I hope, answers that first question.
In terms of the question on the uses of the parental liquidity, there are several. Obviously we run a variety of stress tests
and try and maintain a level of parental liquidity sufficient to meet those stress tests. We also have a variety of
obligations, short-term maturities, debt service that we have to meet. And we also have a plan to reduce contingent
liquidity risk at the company and take down the level of repos and funding arrangements that could result in additional
liquidity need. So we keep adequate reserves for that and again make sure that we do have adequate resources for our
planned and anticipate a capital management activities.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Ed, one another – I guess your other part of the question is with respect to the 2012 dividends.
About $2.5 billion of the $4.5 billion might come from Chartis and we'd expect somewhere around $2 billion from
SunAmerica.
<Q - Edward A. Spehar>: Okay. And just could you talk about just numbers on uses at the holding company beyond
the sort of contingent liquidity, just the normal uses of cash at the holding company?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Yeah. Debt service is roughly $400 million parental – per quarter parental holding
company expense is roughly $250 million or so per quarter.
<Q - Edward A. Spehar>: Okay. I think Jay has a question.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yeah. Just really quickly on the commercial pricing, obviously good to hear that you are getting
momentum in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what you saw in January? I assume probably a fairly active

January season on the commercial side. Can you talk at least qualitatively about the direction of pricing, did it continue
to accelerate?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think that the trend is certainly continuing but perhaps John Doyle, you want to give a little
bit more color on that.
<A - John O. Doyle>: Sure, Peter. Yeah Jay, we saw no slowdown in the momentum in January. We continue to be
encouraged by where retention stands relative to the prices we've been pushing. Rob mentioned Europe. 1/1 is a
particularly big day for our business there and retention was slightly below expectation but rates were ahead of
expectation. So we felt good about that. So there is decent momentum and we are continuing to push and lead the way.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Thanks guys.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Andrew Kligerman with UBS.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Great. Morning. Couple of quick questions. On your capital position, Bob, you threw
around a lot of numbers earlier. What would you estimate to be redeployable capital and would an opportunity, say,
come an equity offering, be the viable situation where you could deploy it?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I'm going to have David and Brian. There is a combination of what's available now, so
if something happened in the next two weeks, there is one availability. The other is dealing with the sale of assets;
recognizing we have the SPV here that has to be paid down as a priority, so we are looking at that priority. So I would
say that until such time as we clear up the balance remaining on the Alico AIA SPV, there isn't a whole lot of cash
based upon what we can do from sales and so on until that's done.
So we are working through that constraint, Brian and his team have given a lot of thought to that. That's why we said
we were looking forward to the IPO of ILFC but the markets really are not welcoming right at this time so we are still
seeing that as a delay until things improve in the airline industry as well as in the market. So I would say, Brian, it's
kind of limited in terms of what we really have in the short term.
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Yeah. As we explained when we were on the road for the equity offering last year, it was
that the bulk of the initial capital management activities would be funded by the monetization of core assets and then
the remaining portion through dividends from the operating companies. So – and again we set an expectation that
capital management wouldn't really start in earnest until 2013, I think you are seeing evidence now that we are a bit
ahead of plan but again it's the value of those non-core assets when they get monetized that will provide the bulk of the
resources for capital management.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Got it. And then just quickly, it's a nice opportunity there to get a gain on the debt
extinguishment. Do you see any near-term opportunities there maybe with some of the hybrid securities?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: At the current time, we don't have any plans for additional hybrid exchanges.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Okay. And then just lastly with regard to the international commercial operations, so
you had an expense ratio in the fourth quarter of 40.1%, it was 43.4%. and it looks like in past years you were kind of
low mid-30%s, so when does that expense ratio come down? I think you mentioned 2013, 2014. Do we sort of see this
elevated level of close to 40% through 2012 and then where should we expect it to come down to, low to mid-30%s?
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Hey Jay, it's Rob. On International commercial – Andrew, excuse me. On the
International commercial what I want to give you a flavor of is timing, with respect to those expense initiatives. So we
are doing a very significant legal entity restructuring in preparation for Solvency II. We expect the vast majority of that
will be completed at the end of 2012, certainly by the beginning of 2013.

We are in the process – separately, we are in the process of implementing SAP as I described. We have a very
significant rollout of SAP occurring in the month of March, but we will continue to roll that out across the rest of
Continental Europe through 2012 and all the way through 2013. So that's – the timing for the backbone infrastructure
work that we are doing will take us all the way through at least the end of 2013 before we start to see improvements in
that area of the world.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: At which time we would probably see a significant drop off in the expense ratio, maybe
down to the mid-30%s at that point?
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: Yeah. What ends up happening is, as you know, we can't get the benefits until we
actually put the technology in place. So we're doing both a complete change in our target operating model structure in
Europe, taking our geographies in which we are doing a lot of our efforts down from 20 different places down to a
handful of different places and that will create significant benefits but we're not going to get that until we actually can
roll the technology out in 2013.
So you're right, generally speaking you will start to see that and we hope it's – we plan for it to be pretty significant in
2014, 2015.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Thanks a lot.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Dan Johnson at Citadel.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Great. Thank you very much. Most have already been asked and answered. So I will just go
with a clarification on the ILFC valuation. I think you had mentioned that there is book value differences that I think
you said at book value sale for ILFC that's about a $2.7 billion difference. Very simply, is this linear, that if you end up
selling ILFC for $1 billion less than their carrying value – or their book value that the $2.7 goes to $3.7, or is there
something else that we need to consider?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah Dan its David. It's not exactly linear. It gets a little bit smaller but I think you have the
gist of it because again the driver of that is obviously the difference between book and tax.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Yeah understood. And then maybe just for Peter a rather broad question just given that you
have got almost 20% of the business in traditional Europe. Would love to just hear some comments of what your folks
are seeing on the ground in terms of how the economic conditions there are impacting the business currently and
thoughts on how it might impact it plus or minus for the rest of the year. Thank you very much.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, I think that in the short term the uncertainty in the euro zone is helping us. Some of
our competitors, especially local competitors, have experienced significant downgrades in their credit rating, while we
have had stable to a stronger credit outlook. And so there is a bit of flight to quality to us. I take small joy in that, even
though there is some short term gains from that growth because I think it's a symptom of a longer term deeper malaise
in the European economy and that can't be good in terms of ultimate demand.
So short term share gains, and I would even think about Greece where we have seen a pickup in our volume at very
attractive rate, it's to me a symptom of flight to quality but I do – I am concerned about long term growth rate in Europe
unless things stabilize, but there is I think some light at the end of that tunnel. I'm pleased by the results over the last
weeks in terms of policy at the macro level but it's an important part of our commercial franchise. I think that like the
U.S. market, it's mature. We need to choose our shots, we needed to manage the cycles well, keep our eye on the
expenses so that we don't feel we have to write bad business to cover our fixed costs and we need to use our capital
sparingly and target it at the more attractive growth economies.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Understood. Great, thank you very much.

And we will take our next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the call, and congratulations on a good quarter.
So wanted to expand the conversation a little bit about some of the capital thresholds, how much excess you would
have over time and some of the underlying drivers of that. And specifically wanted to get a little bit more color around
some of the other key capital and liquidity tests beyond the Tier 1 ratio you flagged. So if you could give us a sense of
what the ratings agency coverage ratios you think that you are being held to are for the holding company liquidity
versus debt service? You recently I think have put in place the capital maintenance agreements which have minimum
RBC levels, it would be helpful to know. And then also if you could just walk us through technically how we should
think about the DTA, the valuation allowance planning through into capital under various measures? That I think would
be a big help as we do our modeling in the future.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Okay. Josh, it's David. I will take the last question first on the DTA, how to think about that.
As Bob mentioned as we think about between now and 2015 we'll use about two-thirds of the total NOLs or the FTCs
in combination. And those cash flows will actually come to the parent company by way of tax sharing arrangements or
treaties that have been in place for a very long period of time. So those cash flows will ultimately flow to the holding
company and will be a part of the parent company cash. Because as you think about the cash that will come, it's the
dividends, the after tax dividends from the operating companies which we've talked a lot about, the tax sharing
payments that will come through the tax sharing treaties, and as Brian mentioned, the monetization of the non-core
assets and we've laid some things out in the Appendix pages 17 to 19 in the deck, can get a pretty good sense of what
those cash flows might ultimately be. And the combination of all of the above that gives us the confidence in why we
are committed to our long-term aspirational goals. It gives us the funding that we need. And also the capital resources
to fund the business growth as Peter and Jay have talked about. So that's the – that maybe the last part of your
comment.
I think and others can certainly chime in with respect to the capital hurdles. There really aren't any new constraints that
we are coming across. I think we've laid those out fairly clearly. Bob talked about the capital requirements with respect
to perhaps Fed oversight, but again there are other things. With respect to the rating agencies, our ratings are very
important. We place a very high degree of importance on that. That's an important consideration. So it's the coverage
ratios and the leverage ratios are not any different for us than they are for any other similarly rated company. So for a
single-A company, I think the coverage ratio is in the five to eight times range or again they are no different for us than
they are for others.
And leverage ratio and again I think this ties back to comments Bob made, leverage ratios are – we've got plenty of
headroom there. That's the – again when we did the recap we "over solved" for capital and that's not a constraint
although it's a consideration and we are mindful of that over time. So hopefully that's helpful to you.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Great, great. And so if I take from all this that sort of in theory you guys can model
forward some substantial capital excess in the future, but at the moment, combination of liquidity and things sort of
makes it much more modest number?
<A - David L. Herzog>: I think – maybe just to clarify again, I would say we are – are and remain committed to our
long-term aspirational goals as we laid out for the world on our recent offering last year. So, again, I think the pacing of
that will be driven by again the framework that I laid out, but as well as monetization, importantly, monetization of
non-core assets and how that plays into considerations of our Fed readiness and where and when we become – if we
become regulated by the Federal Reserve.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: No, I think that all makes sense. Of course, we're just on the business are trying to figure
out the timing of all of that. And just the one follow-up question then, related to I think Brian's comment about sort of
the slow pace of share purchases. I mean, obviously, float is a consideration. In order to make all these repurchases at
any meaningful level, presumably you'd have to be negotiating with the government. And I'm wondering if you can
give us a sense of what – to the extent that they've shared any view with you and sort of how they think about exiting

the remainder of the position. Obviously that's a huge concern or opportunity for investors today?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Yeah, that's a question you'd probably have to address to the U.S. Treasury. We're
focused on operating the business and don't engage in discussions about that. So, that's really what I can say.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: We might take one more question.
<A - Elizabeth A. Werner>: Operator, this would be our last question. Operator, this would be our last question.
Operator
Okay. We'll take our last question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to clarify one quick thing, it's – I've
pretty much got everything I needed. But just the ROE aspirational goal of 2010 and 2015, which book value do I to
use for that? Is it the 55 and grow that forward or is it some other book value I should be using. I am trying to tie it to
an earnings number?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah. We assume that aspirational goal that the DTA was not part of that – not part of that
calculus.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Okay. So just again just very simple – can you just do the math for me? What should I be
doing to the 55 book? Should I take it to something different?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah. It's a good question. We – and that's why we put it in the financial supplement both
with and without. So we've done the math for you. Without it for the quarter we were at 72, with 69 I believe is the
number that's in the financial supplement.
<A - Elizabeth A. Werner>: It's on Page 5.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Page 5 of the financial supplement.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you very much.
<A - Elizabeth A. Werner>: Thank you.
Operator
[audio gap] (1:05:23) today.
<A - Elizabeth A. Werner>: Bob, I will open it up to you for any closing remarks.
Robert H. Benmosche
I just want to say that this is another quarter and we got more to go and I think what you see here is the foundation is
extremely strong, the company is extremely strong, our clients have been with us all the way through it and are very
confident in us. And so look forward to talking to you at the end of the first quarter. Thank you all very much.
Operator
And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.
