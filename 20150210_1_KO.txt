Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. During our last earnings call, we articulated five strategic actions to
re-ignite our growth and committed to providing you an update on our progress as we move forward and into 2015. So
today, I'm going to start with some highlights from our fourth quarter performance and then review the progress we've
made against our five strategic actions.
For those of you following our webcast, you can see our quarterly performance on our new scorecard on Slide 4.
Overall, our performance came in slightly ahead of where we had previously expected. This was driven by some net
positives above the operating income line, slightly offset by higher-than-expected currency re-measurement impact and
profit before-tax.
At the top-line, structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 4% in the quarter, driven by a
balance between volume and underlying price/mix in what was a challenging macro environment.
At the profit level, structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral operating income grew 7% in the quarter, while
we continued to invest heavily behind our media with double-digit increases in the quarter and full-year.
Importantly, there are some highlights for the quarter. We've continued to focus pricing and revenue realization in key
developed markets, with North America and Europe both delivering positive price/mix in the quarter and for the
full-year. Our core strategies and our diversified global portfolio enabled us to gain global value share in nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink sparkling beverages as well as still beverages in the quarter. This is a key metric for us, particularly in a
challenging macro environment.
As we announced last week, we also continued to strengthen our overall portfolio of billion-dollar brands and, in
particular, our still brands. Gold Peak, a premium tea brand in the United States, benefited from great marketing, strong
media and stepped-up execution to achieve this status.
Furthermore, FUZE TEA, our popular mainstream tea brand now available in nearly 40 markets around the world,
reached this status in less than three years, demonstrating the strength of our systems' marketing and executional
capabilities. And finally, I LOHAS, our innovative water brand in Japan, regained billion-dollar brand status in 2014.
This brings our total number of billion-dollar brands to 20, out of which 14 are still brands. Just five years ago, we had
14 billion-dollar brands. Since 2010, on average, we've added more than one new billion-dollar brand each year to the
list.
Stepping back from our quarterly performance, I'd like to talk about the bigger picture in 2014, a year of significant
change for our company that will continue in 2015. Specifically, I want to discuss our five strategic actions to re-ignite
our growth, which are: first, targeting disciplined brand and growth investments; second, driving revenue and profit
growth with clear portfolio roles across our markets; thirdly, refocusing on our core business model; fourth, driving
efficiency through more aggressive productivity; and fifth, last but not least, streamline and simplify our organization.
While we're making solid progress, we have more to do. In 2014, we invested significantly in both our brands and in
incremental growth opportunities. We substantially increased our media investments in markets and categories where
our media was under-funded relative to the market opportunity, where we had the right price/pack channel
architectures, and where we had clear executional alignment with our bottlers. The quality of our media has been
increasing. And we intend to improve it even further under the leadership of our new Global Chief Marketing Officer,
Marcos de Quinto.

We're seeing initial success, as exemplified by North America where our incremental media investments, coupled with
our segmented price/pack strategies, drove revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio through a strong 4% price/mix in
the second half of the year. This gives us confidence that when we invest in our brands, align on our system plans and
focus on execution, we do see positive results.
And looking beyond our existing portfolio, we continue to focus on expanding our participation across a range of
consumption occasions. Today, the average household globally consumes 26 beverages per day. And of these 26
beverages, only 1.4 are Coca-Cola Company brands. Our opportunity to capture more beverage occasions is just
immense. And for that reason, we've announced strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain and Monster
Beverage Corporation. Both of these investments underscore not only our ability to adapt to changing consumer trends,
but also our commitment to accelerate innovation.
Next, we expanded our market segmentation, recognizing that each of our markets has a specific role in order to drive
sustainable revenue growth. Some markets focus on price realization, others on volume and the remainder on a balance
of the two. Importantly, our proxy statement will be coming out in the coming weeks and you will see the revised
incentive metrics which will add revenue growth directly aligned to those market roles.
We also made headway in re-franchising our bottling operations, both in the United States and internationally. In North
America, we closed several re-franchising transactions in 2014 and laid out a clear path and timeline to re-franchise the
remaining territories. Specifically, we re-franchised territories representing approximately 5% of the U.S.
bottler-delivered business in 2014 and have already signed definitive agreements to continue re-franchising a similar
amount in the first half of 2015.
These agreements, along with our ongoing work, give us confidence that we will continue to accelerate our rate of
re-franchising each year and achieve our goal to retain a maximum of about one-third of the U.S. bottler-delivered
business by the end of 2017. And it is our intent to re-franchise the remaining territories by 2020 at the latest. As we
reach the end state in North America, these actions will drive higher operating margins, lower capital spending and
invested capital, and improved ROIC for our company.
Outside of North America, we announced two transformative changes to our bottling landscape in critical, high-growth
markets around the world. First, in Indonesia, we announced a joint venture in Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia that will
help our system to capture the long-term opportunity in this extremely attractive emerging market. We also entered into
an agreement to re-architect our African bottling system, with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will
serve 12 Southern and East African countries and will be a top ten global bottler once the transaction is completed.
Importantly, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment
required to capture the strong long-term growth potential in Africa. These markets will be long-term growth engines for
our company, so it is absolutely critical that we invest sufficiently today to prime those engines for decades to come.
In order to reinvest our business and deliver against our long-term financial targets, we embarked upon an expanded
productivity plan that will result in a total of $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. As Kathy discussed in detail
during our modeling call in December, this represents a significant reduction to our addressable spend base and our
efforts are on track.
As you've seen in the press, we've begun work on reducing positions that are no longer aligned to our growth priorities
or are deemed redundant as we streamline our operations. While this is never an easy process, it is absolutely essential
to ensuring that our business is wired for greater speed, responsiveness, as well as innovation. And importantly, it also
frees up the resources that we need to reinvest in the business to accelerate our growth.
Fifth and finally, towards the end of 2014, we began the process of streamlining and simplifying our operating model.
We announced the streamlining of group functional layers and began standardizing three key processes across our
business units. This will not only reduce our cost structure, but, more importantly, will create a more nimble
organization that is wired to act swiftly and rapidly in today's dynamic landscape.
In summary, I am confident that these strategic actions are laying the groundwork for accelerated top and bottom-line
growth in the future and delivering the long-term shareholder value you expect. Looking ahead, we will continue to

make progress against our actions to regain momentum. But as we've said before, 2015 will be a transition year for the
company as we implement our new operating model. And our incremental media investments in both 2014 and 2015
take time to pay off in full. Further, we expect the global consumer environment to remain volatile. Geopolitical
hotspots around the world, a potential deflationary environment in Europe and continued softness in many emerging
and developing markets around the world could be partially offset by an improving environment in the United States.
So against this backdrop, what remains to be seen is how quickly and to what extent lower oil prices trickle down to
impact consumer discretionary spending, in both importing as well as oil exporting nations. Therefore, we will focus on
what we can control. We will implement our strategies with focus and conviction, investing for the long-term in
emerging markets as well as taking advantage of opportunities to solidify our position in the growth markets of today
and tomorrow.
While in 2015, we expect to grow comparable currency neutral EPS mid-single digits, from 2016 on we intend to be
back to delivering again our long-term target of high single-digit comparable currency neutral EPS growth. We will
strengthen our leading brands through incremental media investments in best-in-class marketing campaigns. We will
deliver a step-change in productivity and complete the majority of North America franchisings, both of which will
drive growth and improve our margin structure. And finally, we will continue to enhance our market-leading
capabilities to provide our customers and consumers with the innovative and refreshing products they expect from The
Coca-Cola Company.
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed
look at our financial performance as well as an outlook on our business for 2015.
Kathy N. Waller
Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our
expectations, due primarily to three factors. First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top-line
performance, thanks to a strong finish during the holiday season. Second, gross margins came in slightly better than
anticipated. And third, operating expenses were lower than expected, which led to comparable currency neutral margin
expansion. We are pleased with where the quarter landed. Structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral revenue
growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipments and 2% underlying price/mix. Concentrate shipments
outpaced unit cases in the quarter, driven by an extra selling day; however, for the full year, concentrate shipments
were in line with unit cases.
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by pricing initiatives in North America, Latin America and Europe.
Importantly, as we've done throughout 2014, we continue to invest behind our brands. During the quarter, our
marketing expenditures grew high single digits, resulting in mid-single-digit growth for the year. This increase in
annual marketing expenditures was driven by a double-digit increase in media investments, as we continue to drive
efficiencies within our overall marketing budget to put against our media spend.
Our fourth quarter comparable EPS was $0.44, which included a 10 point currency headwind. On a comparable
currency neutral basis, our EPS grew 5% in both the quarter and the full year. Items impacting comparability in the
quarter were primarily related to the impact of changing the exchange rate used to re-measure our Venezuela
subsidiary's net monetary assets into U.S. dollars, a write-down on the concentrate sales receivables from our bottling
partner in Venezuela, non-cash charges related to refranchising certain territories in North America, and costs
associated with our previously-announced $3 billion productivity program. Given increased uncertainty and lack of
liquidity in Venezuela, we re-measured our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at the end of the quarter using the
SICAD II exchange rate.
We are also using the SICAD II exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiary's local currency income statement
into U.S. dollars beginning in January 2015. The receivable write-down was recorded as a result of a revised
assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to receive.

Despite a difficult operating environment in Venezuela, the Coca-Cola system remains committed to the market and
will continue producing and selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a daily basis.
As you saw on our scorecard, full year free cash flow was $8.2 billion, up 3% primarily due to the efficient
management of working capital and cycling incremental pension contributions last year, partially offset by an
unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the deconsolidation of the company's
Brazilian bottling operations in July 2013.
For the year, cash return on invested capital declined 32 basis points, due to the $1.5 billion investment we made in
Keurig Green Mountain.
As we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate continued challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets around the
world. Despite this, we are on track with the actions we laid out during our last earnings call and we remain confident
in the outlook we provided in December. Therefore, we expect our comparable currency neutral EPS growth in 2015 to
be mid-single digits, roughly in line with our growth rate in 2014.
As you will recall from our modeling call in December, there are many puts and takes to our P&L in 2015. With the
exception of currencies, these have not changed. Therefore, I'm not going to detail on this call, but you can see the
various line items on Slide 13.
After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior-year rates, we now expect an
approximate five point currency headwind on net revenues, with a seven to eight point headwind on profit before-tax
for the full year 2015. This is a stronger headwind than the previously-communicated five to six points for profit
before-tax, due primarily to the effects from translating our bolivar-denominated profits at the SICAD II rate and to the
recent decline in several emerging market currencies which we do not hedge.
In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 2015. We also have near-term coverage in
place across several other major currencies. There are a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling
the first quarter. Due to our fiscal calendar, there are six additional days in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the
first quarter of 2014. Although that will benefit revenue, variable costs such as marketing, sales and distribution
expenses will also occur to a much greater degree in the first quarter.
We expect the Venezuelan pricing provision will continue to negatively impact our net revenue and operating income
in the first quarter of 2015 as we began to recognize the impact in the second quarter of last year. And we expect
structural items, primarily related to North America, to be a headwind in the first quarter.
Taken together, we expect structural adjustments and the Venezuelan pricing provisions to be an approximate two point
headwind on net revenue and an approximate three point headwind on our profit before-tax. In addition, we will cycle
the timing of expenses in the first quarter of last year when we had four points of operating leverage. Therefore, we
expect that comparable currency neutral operating leverage will be negative in the first quarter.
Finally, we currently expect currency will be an approximate six point headwind on net revenues and an approximate
eight point headwind on profit before-tax in the first quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year.
We currently anticipate closing the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation at the beginning of the second
quarter. Note that this is slightly later than our initial expectations of the first quarter, due to various closing
considerations. At this stage, we do not anticipate any material changes to our structural impact guidance from
December, but, of course, we will update you along the way if there were to be a change.
In closing, we are confident in our strategies and in the actions we have already taken to regain our momentum. 2015
will be a transition year as we implement significant change in our company and continue to reinvest in our business.
We absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in the nonalcoholic beverages
and to continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.
So, Operator, we are now ready for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Good morning.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Good morning.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: I've got a question about – Muhtar, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the consumer
environment remaining volatile in terms of your expectations for 2015. Can you talk a little bit about sort of what range
of volatility you might have embedded in your plans for 2015? Maybe talk a little bit more specifically about the
consumer environment, both in Europe and Latin America, where since those are really two important markets for the
company and where it seems volatile. And then finally, just maybe how that might affect your decision to spend more
marketing in those markets this year, given the volatility. I know there's a lot there, but thanks.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Sure. Thanks, Bryan. First, just at a very high level, 10,000 feet, 2015, I think we expect the
macro environment to even become a little more volatile versus 2013 and 2014, as the microeconomic vagaries get
worse in certain parts of the world. So rate of interest, currencies, certainly will add to the volatility. Growth gaps in
some parts versus other parts are going to grow. Take, for example, the United States and Great Britain, two large
Western economies starting the year 2015 strong, whereas the eurozone, Japan and most of the emerging world starting
the year slower.
So there is this kind of gap and some catching up to do. We are gaining share across the world in sparkling juices,
important categories. The industry – we see some evidence that there is some things that are working for us, but we
need to be cautious and take it quarter-by-quarter. I think that's really important.
And as far as Latin America is concerned, I think Colombia continues to do really well as an economy. And I think
there's some more lifting to do in Mexico and Brazil and the South Cone. But I was recently in Latin America and our
business there continues to – we have a fantastic group of bottling partners investing for the short and long-term
growth, and we continue to gain share. We have a very strong package product channel segmentation and architecture
and pricing – competitive, but, at the same time, great revenue growth management strategies working there.
And so, and Europe, as per the last quarter, quarter four, which we're just reporting on, the Southern European
countries continue to be challenged. Germany, our business was very much in the positive, Northern Europe had a
better environment for us, was a better environment for us than the South. And Eastern Europe is again challenged by
some of the macro volatility that spills over across from the east. So I think that's how we would see it. And then Asia, I
think we're still very bullish and Africa and you see the actions we've taken related to re-organizing our bottling
structure to even better suit the growth potential and the opportunities there in both Indonesia, the fourth most populous
nation in the world, as well as the very dynamic 1 billion-plus consumers plus in Africa.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: And just fair to say that you've got a wider range of volatility or contingencies for that type
of volatility built into the 2015 plans, just maybe than normal, just since it's such a volatile environment?
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Yes, and I think when you look at LRB or nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, Bryan, I think
that what you will see probably is maybe a 100 basis points less growth versus the previous year's, but it's, again,
anybody's guess as to how quickly some of those economies are going to come back. So, we have definitely those
contingencies built in and maybe I can refer to Ahmet to give you a few more snapshots of the world in terms of the
micro and macro picture. Ahmet?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Thanks, Muhtar. Bryan, the only thing I would add to Muhtar's characterization is that
volatility sort of comes on top of a slowdown, but what's working for us is that we're getting more and more traction on

our plans and programs working with our bottlers. I was in about four or five different countries over the last couple of
weeks. And even though we witness economic volatility or uncertainty even in Northern Europe, yes, there is
quantitative easing. Yes, there is lower oil prices, but it is uncertain yet whether the consumer will really benefit from
that. But even within that, our plans that address the right pricing and packaging and the right level of media investment
and our alignment with our bottling system is giving us confidence that we could actually weather this volatility, in line
with the guidance that has been provided.
So there are a couple of bright spots, too. I was in India, probably one country where there is a lot of optimism inside
the country in terms of economic development. And, as you know, we have an incredible momentum in India over the
last seven or eight years, especially last year. And our plans continue to build on each other from year-to-year, so that's
strong. I was in Brazil, again a similar story, after the elections there was some cautious optimism and that sort of
caution side of that continues. There's still a bit of optimism, but we do continue to deliver our results despite that
environment. As you know, Brazil had a mid-single digit growth at the end of the quarter. Yes, it was cycling better
numbers from last year, but we've also had very strong share gains in Brazil. So I would say that is our story. There is
volatility on top of a slowdown, but we do have traction with our plans and programs in the marketplace with close
alignment with our bottlers.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: All right, thanks.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Bryan, last thing I'd add to what Ahmet said and what I had said earlier to your question about
does it make sense to invest in media and marketing and the answer is absolutely yes. When we are able to target our
investments in media and the way we're doing it, segmenting them by the different countries and the different regions
of the world, and improving not just the quantity, but also the quality of the media, that's what's one of the main
important factors that we see driving a better revenue number, a better price/mix number. So the two are really
connected. And that's what I really want to – so gaining share, improving on the top-line, through all the actions we're
taking, of which targeted media increased and improved quality media is one of those.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: All right. Thank you for that. I look forward to seeing you next week down at CAGNY.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, me too.
<A - Timothy K. Leveridge>: Thanks, Bryan.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning. So I guess my question is really relating to the strong price/mix that
you saw in North America in the quarter. Obviously, you've been focused on getting mix impact and rational pricing.
Can you just speak to how much of the improvement was mix driven, as opposed to maybe cycling some of the
heightened promotional environment last year and as you think about 2015 and beyond, just thinking about some of the
mix acceleration potential in the pricing side in North America?
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Sure, Judy. Good morning. Thanks. I'll let Irial answer that question. And then also Sandy will
add flavor to that, too.
<A - Irial Finan>: Okay. Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, Judy. Listen, I think the most important thing is four
quarters ago, Sandy and I spoke on this topic and we reiterated our belief in having balanced price/mix volume growth
in North America. And we've delivered on that in every quarter this year. And our plan is to deliver again next year in
the same way. In terms of your question on mix and headline price, it's a balanced approach. Yes, in the fourth quarter
last year, we were trending some lower numbers where we had some heavy promotional activity, but when you look
over the half year, as Muhtar said, we grew pricing 4%.
So we feel very good about the actions we're taking. We're feeling very good about how the trade is reacting and, more
importantly, we're feeling very good that our marketing and our execution are coming together in a way that really adds

incremental value to our system. But I'll maybe ask Sandy to add to that. Sandy?
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr.>: Sure. Good morning, Judy. As Irial said, it's a consistent strategy. And the
strategy is born of where the consumer wants us to go. The consumer is buying smaller special packages of our
sparkling beverage brands and accelerating that purchase. And we're seeing the kind of mix benefit from that that you
described. But that couples with a disciplined approach to rate and volume, because, in the end, what we're trying to do
is expand the value and usefulness of our brands and create value for our customers. And through the consistent
execution of that strategy, we're seeing in 2014 a solid year, but a year of improving performance through the year and
we'll continue to pursue that disciplined strategy in 2015.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay. And then, Kathy, if I can just have a quick follow-up just in terms of the
commodities in 2015, what have you locked in, in terms of your exposure there? And as you think about different
commodity complexes that are turning more favorable, how much of that could we expect to see drive some of that
margin improvement, particularly in markets like North America?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Okay, Judy. Our commodities environment for 2015, commodities we expect really to be
benign for us, right. There are some that are absolutely favorable, but then we have other challenges. And depending on
– not in North America, but outside of North America, we also have the impact of secondary exchange embedded into
our commodities. So we really anticipate it being more of a benign commodity environment for us versus having any
significant benefit from it.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Understood. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMC.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to follow-up a little bit on, Muhtar, on your
comments on Europe, and, obviously, it's been a difficult market over the past couple of years. And what's the right
way to think about sort of a glide path getting back to growth there? Is it something where if QE works and we start to
see the economy come back, do you think you can get back to consistent growth? And what are some realistic ranges of
expectations for 2015 and potentially into 2016? Thanks.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, well, I think we're all going to watch what's happening with quantitative easing, John, in
Europe. 18 months of the planned amount, $60 billion a month of euros kicking in, whether that'll have an impact or
not, we will watch and see. I think stability is the key word for Europe as we go into 2015, so not getting much worse,
and I think in some areas continued volatility. And South Europe is going to continue to be – certainly to be challenged.
So I don't think there's going to be suddenly a lifting of the clouds for the consumers in the Southern belt of Europe. I
think German – the current exchange rates, I think will help exporting countries for sure. How soon will that trickle in
related to Germany, related to other export markets from Europe, but that's a positive.
The quantitative easing is a positive. The notion that most consumers now are used to this environment and feel that it's
not going to get much worse make it a little better because of the QE. So we'll have to see. But we think that it will
continue to be challenged. And then, you've got, of course, the whole political environment to sort of basically weave
into the equation. Weave into the equation that political environment is something that is an unknown for us all. I think
that's how I would see.
As far as growth, yes, there will be pockets of growth in Europe, and there will be continued pockets of challenges, but
I think what we see with our – we have very strong plans in place with our bottling partners for growth in Europe. And
we will see how – we have all kinds of contingencies built into the plan in Europe also and we're going to take it
quarter-by-quarter.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Great. Thanks. And if I can ask one follow-up to Kathy, Kathy, you talked about your FX
coverage on translational for 2015. Obviously, what this can lead to sometimes is sort of a year two impact. Any

thoughts on 2016 and how you'll manage what could potentially be some FX headwinds there as the hedges roll off?
Thanks.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Yeah, so, John, so for 2016, we are also hedged on our major currencies at this point, and also
have some on the – on other currencies as well. So we will manage the impact and we have pretty good rates at this
point with our hedging, so basically we don't think that there's a relative issue at this point.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess one quicker clarification question, then a slightly more
thematic one. First, obviously, there were a lot of moving parts driving price and mix in the quarter globally. And I
wondered if you could just focus in on rate increases and talk about trends there, because my guess is that rate lagged
overall price/mix in North America, which you talked about. But Europe, the Bottling Investments Group, Latin
America, and then rate was probably stronger than price/mix in Eurasia, Africa, Pacific, and across the whole company.
So any help there would be great, just parsing out overall rate trends.
And then more broadly, it sounds like your productivity targets remain unchanged from last fall, which isn't really
surprising as it's only been a few months. But, at the same time, we've already seen announcements of head count
reductions that likely were not envisioned prior to your October update. So I'm wondering why we're not seeing more
incrementally sooner on that front, or perhaps we are. It's just being absorbed by the macro headwinds. So if you could
clarify that, that'd be great.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Steve, this is Muhtar. Good morning again. As far as the rate versus mix, I think it's
basically completely dependent on the country and the environment and the region. So there's no trend globally. This is
– on average, this much rate and this much, it all depends on our price/pack channel architecture, our position in the
market, the strength of our brands, how effective is our marketing driving the results that we need, which is all work in
progress. So I think it all depends. And I'll let Sandy comment on the United States on that, but it's very much
dependent on the region and dependent on the country and dependent on the circumstances. I think that's really what I
would say. And then, Sandy, you want to just address the United States part of that question?
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr.>: Sure. I mean, our strategy in the U.S. is – again, as Irial said, very consistent. We
view there to be a significant upside pricing opportunity in the sparkling beverage category. We are driving that with
significant investments in brand building and execution of a price/package architecture that will expand margins for our
system and also for our customers, and that involves a very healthy rate program. But at the same time, we're executing
with a tremendous amount of energy, multiple proprietary and other small packages that the consumer is buying at
accelerating rates. I mean, for example, Mini Cans increased by 15% in the fourth quarter. And that's us following the
consumer to smaller package sizes of the brands they love. And that combination of rate and mix is creating a good
balance with volume to a healthy top-line growth picture.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: And, Steve, just on your question on productivity, I will say to you that the re-org and how we
are flattening the organization and the number of – and announced cuts, were all part of the program, totally part of the
program, so there's nothing that – and it just being executed, that's all. So, and as Kathy – we stand by what Kathy said
in the modeling call in December. We're on track with the $500 million-plus piece of the productivity program for
2015, and we're on track with that. So but just to emphasize, all of what you see, what you hear, what you read, was
part of the program.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Okay. So just two points of clarification just to follow up on those answers, thank you very
much. On the price/mix I guess maybe just, Kathy, specifically to Eurasia, Africa, where I'm assuming you have rate
pricing in Russia, for example, is quite positive. Should we be expecting this negative mix trend to persist in 2015?
This was one follow-up on pricing. And then, Muhtar, to your point on the – part of the plan, does that mean the head

count reductions, for example, that were announced, was that part of the original $1 billion, or is that part of the
additional $2 billion that was announced last fall? Thanks.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Just quickly on the last piece of your question, it was part of the additional $2 billion. And then
as far as the rate increases, I'll defer to Ahmet if you want to just refer to that part of the question?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Yeah, hey, John (sic) [Steve]. On markets like EAG, we price in line with inflation. We may
be slightly below inflation, slightly ahead at times. So you should expect to see consistent rate increase more or less in
that range. Fourth quarter for EAG was a bit of an anomaly. There was a sort of a geographic mix impact that was
driven by cycling of down shipments. So if you look at full-year price/mix realization at EAG, it's a healthy four points,
so I wouldn't look at Q4 to draw any conclusions.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. So given the pressure that currency is placing and all this macro volatility, do you
anticipate or can you actually accelerate anything around your cost-cutting plans to offset this? Or do you plan taking
even more pricing in places like Europe, Eurasia, Africa or Asia Pacific where it does not look like you're offsetting
your currency moves as much?
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I think, Ali, just on a broad-base answer to your question, I think it's really critical that we
balance the needs in the marketplace and the needs for us to be healthy in the marketplace on a both medium and
long-term basis. That's why we hold accountable all our business unit Presidents for local currency. And I think that
we're very happy with our progress so far with what we are doing with our productivity initiatives and what the current
results are for those productivity initiatives so far. Early days, but we certainly are looking to do more where it makes
sense, but one thing you will not see us is taking basically actions in the marketplace that weakens our position for the
medium and long-term. That's the critical piece that I want to stress.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So in other words, we should anticipate more pricing as FX continues to be a negative pressure. And
if you could answer that also in the context of the benign-ness of commodities in 2015, and if that's a limit on your
ability to take pricing again to offset FX in the broader price context.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: I think we work with all the different levers that are available to us, how our better marketing,
more marketing is working driving results, how the investments are working we're putting in the marketplace with our
bottling partners, our basic brand strength in the marketplace. All of those things and essentially, in terms of
commodities, again, that's something that is very volatile in the world that we live in. Four or five months ago, if
someone said we'd be looking at the current price of oil, no one would have believed us.
So I think everything is changing very rapidly. And we are remaining flexible on what we can achieve to the best of our
ability, both in pricing, both in terms of investing for the future as well as making sure that our investments are targeted
and our segmentation works. So I think there's not one solution. The segmentation is really driving better results than
we had anticipated when we put that programming into place.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay, so I'm just trying to understand, so we could anticipate if the consumer is ready to do it and if
the segmentation suggests, we could see more pricing aligned with inflation because of currencies being so negative. Is
that fair, what you're saying?
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Ali, I'll just leave it at what I said.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. Okay, thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Financial.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Thanks. Morning, everyone. Just a quick one, Kathy, a technical question, the six
additional days in the first quarter, is there some level of give-back later in the year? Do we see a reversal of that in the
fourth quarter, for example?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Yes. Based on our 4-4-5 calendar, the six additional days get pushed into the first quarter, but
they come out in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Okay. Fair enough. That's all I've got. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Good morning.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey, one just sort of housekeeping question, can you just tell us what the pricing would've
been in Latin America if you were at SICAD II for this year and last?
<A - Muhtar Kent>: That's all local currency, so it is what it is.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Yeah.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I think what we talk about is all pricing in terms of the local currency we take, so whether
we re-measure that in SICAD I or SICAD II, it'll be the same number.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. I was trying to get at what impact Venezuela had on the price, just for modeling for next
year, if there was a sort of Venezuela anomaly this quarter that might've – take that pricing down next year.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: So for next year, what the impact of fair pricing law will continue in Venezuela. That is what
actually impacts our revenue in Venezuela. So it caps our ability to take revenue. That does continue, obviously, it
starts over in 2015, but it will not be a structural item because we cycle it as of the second quarter. So then yes, we also
do have an impact to our revenues from a different exchange rate, and that would be considered currency.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. No, that's very helpful. Thanks. And then just on Asia Pacific, it came in a little bit
lighter than our expectations and I think it was one of the lowest volume outcomes in a while. And in your prepared
comments, it seems like you were fairly sanguine about that segment. So was there an anomaly this quarter that took
the volume a little bit softer in the price/mix so negative? I know there was a mix element there, but any comments on
that would be very much appreciated.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Hey, Bill. This is Ahmet. I'll try to address that. So one big thing was the timing of the
Chinese New Year, but I wouldn't conclude my comments without saying that the market in China, especially the food
and beverage market, has been weakest in the last 10 years, but I would also say that we've been consistently applying
our strategy that we have covered with you guys a number of times before and resulting in fairly significant share gains
in China. And, as you know, in Japan, in the middle of last year, there was increase in taxes and we're continuing to see
the effect of that, but still delivering almost close to flat, but not that close. It's minus 1%. So – but the biggest item
there was the timing of the Chinese New Year as well as continued sort of industry headwinds in China.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Great. And I can ask one quick last one if I could, just to kind of gauge the progress of the
productivity program, is a good metric to look at the corporate unallocated line on the segment data? Does that come
down as kind of the restructuring savings come through?

Operator
Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.
Muhtar Kent
Thank you Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Tim. In summary, we're moving quickly to re-ignite revenue growth, while
simultaneously driving cost out of our business through an aggressive productivity plan. While we've already made
progress against our five strategic actions to regain our momentum, we're just beginning. 2015 will be a transition year
as we rewire our operating model for growth amidst an uncertain global consumer environment. While the
macroeconomic environment remains challenging in the near-term, we are confident in our ability to return to
sustainable growth as the long-term dynamics of our industry remain promising, our brands and our global system are
unparalleled and we are fully dedicated to strengthening our position as the world's leading beverage company.
As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.
