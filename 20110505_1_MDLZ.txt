MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to Kraft Foods' first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Today's call is scheduled to last
about one hour, including remarks by Kraft management, and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Jakubik, Vice President, Investor Relations for Kraft. Please go ahead, sir.
Christopher M. Jakubik
Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; Tim McLevish, our
Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Brearton, who will succeed Tim as CFO beginning next week.
Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release. The release along with today's slides are available on our website,
KraftFoodsCompany.com.
As you know, during this call we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. The statements
are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to
the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our
forward-looking statements.

Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP
reconciliation within our earnings release, and the back of the slide presentation.
Let me now turn it over to Irene.
Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon.
I'm very pleased that we got off to a strong start in 2011. On the top line, organic revenues grew more than 4.5%,
despite the Easter shift into the second quarter. And on the bottom line, our operating EPS increased more than 6%,
despite a number of headwinds. These included the continuing rise in commodity costs, the Easter shift, and the
additional interest and higher share count from financing the Cadbury deal.
These headline numbers are very encouraging. And as we look to the balance of the year, there are three reasons that
give me great confidence that we're on track to deliver top tier results. First, it's clear that our continuing investments in
marketing and innovation are delivering good returns. Around the world, higher levels of brand support are enabling us
to take pricing to offset rising input costs. In the face of these price increases, I'm especially pleased that our strong
brand equities have enabled us to maintain solid market shares.
Second, the end-to-end cost management initiatives that Dave Brearton laid out at CAGNY are driving significant
improvements in productivity and overheads. Underlying operating income margin rose by 60 basis points, reaching
13.9%. Margins improved despite the fact that our commodity costs were up about 7% to 8% over last year. In
addition, we increased our investments in advertising and consumer support by more than 14% on a like-for-like basis.
Third, we're seeing early benefits from executing as one company following last year's Cadbury acquisition. This is
most pronounced in our developing markets. Sanjay Khosla put it well when we reviewed his first quarter results last
week. He said we saw the power of the $50 billion gorilla at work.
Indeed, we saw it play out in our ability to deliver our results in the wake of the tragedy in Japan. Despite numerous
obstacles, we've leveraged our diverse supply chain to get our products to market. As a result, our sales in Japan were
up 11% in the first quarter.
And in India, our recent launch of Oreo provides a great example of what we can now accomplish by leveraging our
extensive sales footprint. In March we launched the world's favorite cookie through our chocolate sales networks, and I
can tell you Oreo is off to a very strong start. In less than a month, we've reached more than 300,000 sales outlets
across the country.
In fact, Oreo's performance is on fire across our entire developing markets region. In the first quarter, sales of Oreo
were up 56% versus prior year. This year we expect Oreo to be a $700 million business in developing markets alone.
That's up from about $175 million in 2006, more than a threefold increase.
Now let me turn it over to Tim to provide more details on our first quarter results.
Timothy R. McLevish
Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon.
Overall, we were quite encouraged by our first quarter performance. Actually, it was even stronger than we had
anticipated. As Irene noted, our continued investments in marketing and innovation are strengthening our brands. This
has enabled us to take necessary pricing actions to help offset higher input costs in all of our geographies. As a result,
we delivered strong top line growth of 4.6% in the quarter. Our power brands led the way, up 7%.

We also delivered positive vol/mix despite higher pricing. This is proof of the power of our portfolio. In fact, vol/mix
was positive even with the Easter shift, which tempered growth by about 1.5 points in the quarter.
We're also pleased that vol/mix held up so well even though many of our competitors have not raised prices. Please
note that we have simplified our definition of organic revenue growth to exclude Starbucks, as well as the favorable
impact of accounting calendar changes. We've done this to provide a clean comparison on a like-for-like basis.
Turning to margins, we continue to make progress. Our underlying operating income margin increased 60 basis points
to 13.9%. Our pricing actions are catching up to higher input costs. And end-to-end cost management is making
important contributions in procurement, in customer service and logistics, and in manufacturing with Lean Six Sigma.
These cost savings in turn funded a significant increase in A&C [Advertising & Consumer] This is our virtuous cycle
in action, driving top tier revenue growth through investments in marketing and innovation, while end-to-end cost
management expands margins and generates savings to reinvest for future growth.
Turning to EPS, as we outlined in February, we thought operating EPS would be down a few pennies from last year,
but actually EPS grew from $0.49 to $0.52. This is driven by stronger operating earnings and from the timing of
mark-to-market gains. Let me walk you through the specifics.
Gains from operations added $0.03, while the impact of an extra month of profit from Cadbury added $0.04. The
year-over change in the mark-to-market of commodity hedge positions added $0.04, but that favorability will reverse in
coming quarters. And finally, interest expense, and the impact of more shares outstanding were $0.07 higher due to the
Cadbury acquisition. Bottom line, we posted a solid increase in operating EPS, and we did so in a high quality manner.
This was despite the Easter shift, and the negative $0.02 to $0.03 impact from Cadbury.
All regions contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. Here is a breakdown. North America's first quarter
showed the virtuous cycle is taking hold. Organic net revenues were up 2.2%. As expected, pricing was the key driver,
representing 3.3 percentage points of the growth. What's more, we priced earlier than many competitors. But despite
this, vol/mix declined only modestly, In fact, if it hadn't been for the 1.5 point impact from the Easter shift, vol/mix
would have been positive.
As Tony Vernon outlined at CAGNY, we're continuing to invest behind our power brand and new products in North
America, and they're responding well. Power brands were up nearly 4%, led by double-digit growth of Chips Ahoy!,
Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, and Halls.
Several of our innovations also contributed. Our new MiO liquid beverages mix and Oscar Mayer Carving Board cold
cuts are trending well in terms of consumption, velocity, and consumer feedback.
As Irene mentioned earlier we're encouraged by our brands' ability to maintain market share in an inflationary
environment. Early results indicate our prior estimate around the price elasticity of demand might have been a bit
conservative. Nevertheless, we remain cautious. That's because the impact of our pricing is not likely to be fully
reflected on store shelves until midyear.
Now let's take a look at profitability. Operating income margins have increased slightly in a difficult environment. As
we said last quarter, in the face of substantial input cost inflation, we've implemented a series of price increases across
our North American portfolio. Today, pricing is catching up to higher input costs, and so further actions are likely in a
number of categories. But we're confident that the combination of pricing, productivity, and overhead savings will
enable us to increase A&C, and deliver solid margin performance for the full year.
Our European business remains on solid footing. In fact, Mike Clarke and his team posted their fifth consecutive
quarter of both top and bottom line growth. That's despite sharp increases in commodities, and a still fragile economy,
most notably in Southern Europe. Organic revenues grew 4.4% in the quarter, led by more than 6% growth in our
power brands. Growth was balanced, with nearly equal contributions from pricing and vol/mix.
We're encouraged that our marketing and innovation investments are paying off here as well. With stronger brand
equities than just a few years ago, we're now pricing to offset higher input costs. And despite these increases, our
market shares remain solid across the region. We've implemented a first round of pricing. However, at current cost

levels, further pricing may be necessary later in the year.
I would also point out that Europe's solid vol/mix performance came despite the Easter shift, which negatively affected
it by about 2.5 percentage point; the bulk of that was in chocolate. Top line growth was broad-based, with coffee,
biscuits, and cheese leading the way. Coffee was up double-digits, with pricing as a key factor. But we also realized
significant gains in vol/mix, driven by Tassimo growth of almost 30%.
In addition, our new Kenco Millicano is off to a strong start in the U.K. Consumer feedback to this whole-bean instant
coffee has been very good. We expect more than 75% distribution by the end of the second quarter as we step up our
marketing support.
Biscuits grew mid-single-digits behind our focus on growth platforms like Choco-Bakery. Milka biscuits continued to
perform well in Germany, as did Cote d'Or in France and Benelux. We also realized robust double-digit growth in
white-space markets, with Oreo launches in France and Germany and Velveeta Breakfast Biscuit in the U.K. This
helped drive overall Oreo growth of nearly 40%, while Velveeta nearly doubled.
Our cheese business delivered solid growth as well. Philadelphia grew double-digits behind a versatility strategy to
encourage it as a cooking ingredient. This has been so successful that we've now imported it to the U.S. as well. In
addition, the launch in Germany of Philadelphia with Milka, a lower fat alternative to Nutella, exceeded our
expectations. In fact, we reached our full-year target in the first quarter.
Operating income margins in Europe rose 30 basis points to 11.9%. Lower overheads drove the margin expansion.
As I mentioned earlier, input costs have increased significantly. Our European business is pricing accordingly, but
hasn't yet caught up. As we look at the balance of the year, we're confident that the combination of pricing,
productivity, and overhead savings will deliver another year of strong profit performance.
In developing markets, solid execution of our 5-10-10 strategy: our focus on five key categories, 10 priority markets,
and 10 power brands, continues to deliver quality growth. Organic revenues grew 9.6%, with a good balance between
pricing and vol/mix. In fact, except for the Easter shift, this region would have posted another quarter of double-digit
gains. Power brands grew 16%, led by 56% growth of Oreo in the quarter.
Several other power brands also performed well. [ph] Toot (14:51) and Club Social crackers grew more than 25%,
while Tang and Cadbury Dairy Milk each rose nearly 20%.
Within the region, Asia-Pacific and Latin America continued to grow double-digits. CEEMA [Central and Eastern
Europe, Middle East, and Africa] revenue rose in the mid-single-digits despite weak economic conditions, and the
Easter shift.
Several markets stood out in the quarter. In India, our business grew more than 40%. And with our recent launches of
both Oreo and Tang in this market, we're confident that robust growth will continue. China and Indonesia each grew
more than 20%. Brazil continued to drive growth in Latin America, with revenues up mid-teens. And the Ukraine was
up double-digits, leading the way in CEEMA.
Operating income margin in developing markets declined to 12.2%, largely due to a substantial increase in A&C.
Pricing and cost management savings and favorable vol/mix more than offset higher input costs. As in Europe, pricing
has not yet caught up to input costs, but we expect a better alignment of price versus cost as the year unfolds.
Now before I turn over to Dave, I'd like to take a moment to say how much I've enjoyed working with everyone here at
Kraft over the past 3-1/2 years, including our analysts and shareowners. I have great respect for the Board, Irene, and
the rest of the leadership team. Together, I believe we've put Kraft on a solid path to deliver consistent top tier
performance. And I'm turning over the CFO reins to a great colleague and a good friend. You'll be in very good hands
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on our guidance.

David A. Brearton
Thanks, Tim. For those of you who have met Tim in person, I know you'll understand when I say I'll have very big
shoes to fill, in more ways than one. But I look forward to building on his progress, and the company's excellent
financial foundation.
Turning to our guidance, on the top line we're confident we'll deliver organic net revenue growth of at least 4% in 2011.
That excludes the impact of the loss of the Starbucks CPG business, and the favorable impact of accounting calendar
changes. As you've seen, we've started the year strong and we remain cautiously optimistic with regard to the balance
of the year. We're realizing better alignment between pricing and input costs, and volumes to-date have held up well.
But we're cautious on near-term demand as the impact of inflation on the consumer has not yet fully played through in
the marketplace.
At the same time, we believe we're well-positioned as we continue to fuel the virtuous cycle we outlined at CAGNY.
Our end-to-end cost management will drive productivity and overhead savings. And we'll continue to increase
investments in marketing, innovation, and other brand-building investments to drive top tier growth.
On the bottom line, we now expect operating EPS of at least $2.20 this year. We've adjusted our numbers to reflect a
$0.05 to $0.07 impact from recent changes in our U.S. premium coffee segment. These include the loss of the
Starbucks CPG business, some-related trapped overhead costs, and the launch of Gevalia premium coffee coming in
August.
Most important, our overall business momentum remains strong. Excluding the changes in U.S. premium coffee, our
earnings outlook for the balance of our business remains consistent with prior guidance of 11% to 13% growth.
Now I'll turn the call back to Irene for some concluding remarks.
Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Dave. Our strong start this year demonstrates the power of the virtuous cycle we've created around the world.
This is due in no small part to the work that Tim has done over the past 3.5 years. Tim has been a terrific partner since
joining Kraft Foods in 2007. And I want to thank him for all he did to help me lead our organization through great
change. We went from an operating division of Altria to a standalone public company and now a leader in the food and
beverage sector.
Tim was also instrumental in several important transactions that have transformed our portfolio, especially the
acquisition of Cadbury. We will certainly miss Tim's perspective and commitment, but we're fortunate to have an
experienced and knowledgeable leader like Dave ready to step in and seamlessly assume the role. I'm quite confident
that we won't miss a beat on our path to sustainable top tier growth.
Now we'd be happy to take your questions.

Your first question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks, congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask you about the Cadbury business in particular,
and then in gum and progress in gum and also, maybe a comment on chocolate in particular. I know you had – we had
some weakness, particularly in some of the developing southern European markets there in gum. How are things
trending there as we head later into the year? Do you feel like things are trending the right direction? Thanks.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: David, there's no question that Cadbury has transformed the business, as we had hoped it
would, in terms of our portfolio, our distribution capabilities, and the geographic footprint, and it's certainly playing out
in our results. We also feel very good about overall how the business is performing, as you are aware. It's exceeding
our financial expectations. It's going to be EPS accretive this year, and our cash flow more than doubled last year, and
we see further opportunity. So, in aggregate, we feel quite good about it.
And certainly, the chocolate business in general is performing quite well. We had some short-term impact in the first
quarter, as we've discussed, due to Easter effect. But we feel quite good about our chocolate business, and especially in
our developing markets. We saw Cadbury Dairy Milk grow almost 20% versus historical growth in the range of 7%.
So, we feel quite good overall about chocolate.
Gum continues to be a challenge. It is very much an attractive category. We feel very confident that it has good
long-term growth prospects, but we are seeing two very specific problems in the short term. Certainly, the category is
not as robust as it has been historically. In large measure, as we've discussed, we believe that's due to macroeconomic
conditions. And the other piece is that our U.S. business is not performing, as well as we'd like. Both of the key
competitors in the category have been investing to stimulate category growth. I think we're beginning to see
macroeconomic recovery in a number of markets around the world, and I feel that the category will come back over
time.
In the U.S., though, our challenge is really that our first half innovations have not lived up to our expectations. We
launched Trident Vitality. It has been a solid single, but Trident Layers last year was a home run. And so it has not only
been below our expectations, but it's up against a tough comp. The fact is we're on the case, and I'm quite confident that
we will see recovery in the back half of the year.
I'd also say that elsewhere in the world, we're seeing some very strong growth in the gum category, markets like Russia,
Turkey, South Africa, all up solidly over 30%, Japan up 20%. So, net-net, the overall business is doing well. Chocolate
is on track. Gum continues to be a bit of a challenge, particularly in the U.S. But I'm quite confident that it will recover
as the year progresses.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Investment Research.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: I'm getting too many earnings reports here. I just wanted – effectively one big question on
coffee in a couple of parts. Does the guidance assume that you will receive proceeds from the Starbucks CPG business,
and does it assume use of proceeds? And I'll just tick off a couple more and let you guys pick on how you want to
answer them in what order.

And then the coffee strategy, I'd like you to talk about the advertising budget. It is my perception that one reason why
the U.S. single-serve coffee business with Tassimo has not done so well is because that advertising budget was cut
years ago, and it looks like you have to really replenish that to get it going again.
And then finally, can you just comment on Gevalia and this premium strategy? What kind of backing will it get on its
launch, and how long would you expect to sustain it? Thank you.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: So let me see if I can take those one at a time. Our guidance does not include any proceeds
from the arbitration. We feel quite confident in our position. We built a very solid business together, and we do expect
to be compensated for that. But exactly what time, and what the magnitude would be is uncertain at this point, so we
did not factor that in.
With respect to Tassimo, we continue to see very strong performance, particularly in our international markets. It's up
over 30%, about 35% globally. And the North America business is up over 50%. It is true that we cut back on our mass
market support of Tassimo simply because we discovered that it made more sense to target this offering to people that
were coffee lovers. And so we continue to support the brand quite actively, and we feel very good about its
performance in North America. In Canada, we're doubling the size of the business. We've got a strong number one
share. In the U.S., the business, as I said, continues to grow. And in fact, even our business ex the Starbucks discs was
up a healthy – over 20%. So, we feel good about the performance of Tassimo, and we are continuing to support it.
With respect to Gevalia, we've given it a nice launch. It's a very important part of our premium strategy, which we've
shared with you. And it's a strong business. It's a very good coffee. It's a leading brand in Europe. And what you may
not realize is it's actually already over a $200 million business in the U.S. that consumers already know. And we've got
some very good brand awareness to be tapping into. So, I feel very good about the launch of Gevalia. We've got a fairly
robust plan to introduce it, and that's part of the investment in coffee that Dave alluded to, the $0.05 to $0.07 we talked
about. And we're quite confident that we've got a very robust pipeline in our European business that we will be able to
bring over to the U.S. now that we don't have the constraints of the contract.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Good evening, everybody.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hello, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: So Tim, best of luck.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Thank you, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess a couple of questions. First is just looking at the balance sheet, it looks like there's
been really no progress on the debt. In fact, maybe it's the cost of inventories or stuff, but it looks like debt actually
increased from the December to the March quarter-end. Could you talk about that for a second?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yes, seasonally, first quarter usually is a higher working capital quarter. If you looked at
it historically, you will see that our cash position in the first quarter usually is negative seasonally. This quarter that was
exacerbated a little bit with Easter shift. We were assembling inventories for the Easter selling season that sat there, a
lot of them sat there at the end of the first quarter. The year-end run-up in FX as the balance sheet was translated to
U.S. dollars also pushed it up a little bit. And further, the higher input costs reflected higher inventories. So,
consequently yes, the working capital was higher, which ultimately resulted in lower cash flows and debt about – I
think it's a little over $1 billion higher than we would have anticipated.

Also note that we made a $500 million pension contribution in January of this year. So, the combination of higher
working capital and that pension contribution are in the net debt levels. But we do anticipate getting back on track or
remaining on track and bring the debt levels down to the levels that we have identified consistent with our ratings
targets by year-end.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, thank you for that. And then I guess, Irene, it looks as if over the last four quarters that
U.S. snack operating profits excluding various charges, et cetera, have been down. I'm surprised. Maybe that is a
function of the gum weakness. But is there anything else going on there, or has it just become a pretty competitive
category whether we look at gum or biscuits?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, actually, Eric, actually gum is a piece of it. It's really primarily due to the fact in that
business, pricing hasn't yet caught up to rising input costs. We've been very sensitive to making sure that we get the
right balance between protecting our shares and our underlying momentum. There's some impact on that business as
well from the Easter shift because crackers tend to be more skewed – will be more skewed to the second quarter. But a
big part is just they haven't fully been able to recover their input cost increases, as well as we have continued to invest
in a number of our core brands. And that's part of the reason that we're seeing very strong top line performance from a
number of the power brands, but that will equalize over time.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, and last question. It looks as if in the first quarter, if I read the table correctly, Cadbury
was $0.03 dilutive. And yet you're saying it is going to be accretive for the year, even though the sales are not where
you want them to be. So, can you bridge those two? And is it more of a cost savings story now, at least for the moment?
Is that how the accretion is going to ramp up so significantly here?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Eric, I'll answer at least the first part of it. The first quarter, actually we didn't give you
quite enough information to determine the accretion/dilution in the first quarter. There are pieces of it that are delta
from last year. In fact, Cadbury was modestly dilutive, not the $0.03, but probably close to $0.02 dilutive in the first
quarter. But that's right on track with what we expect to be for accretive this year.
A lot of the increase is going to be the synergies. We've said that we'd be at a 70% run rate or the $750 million by
year-end coming out of 25% last year. We added, I think, another 7% or 8% in the first quarter. So, we're right on track
on generating synergies. And, although revenues in some of the Cadbury categories were a bit soft, we would anticipate
that to pick up in the back half of the year.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I would say just to correct the assumption, we feel quite good about the aggregate revenue,
so we're not concerned about that at all.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I wanted to ask you, if I could, in relation to pricing versus cost inflation. So, in this
quarter, was that a drag on the gross margin?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Actually pricing overall for Kraft was modestly ahead of the cost environment.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, and then I wanted to ask really from a broader standpoint. But Europe in general
has been a difficult area to price in. This quarter did show good pricing on your part. But I would suspect just given
some of the categories you compete in, you need more. Are those price increases in place already, and they'll start
phasing in, or is there more pricing still to take in Europe; and just if you could talk generally about the environment
there for trying to get price realization?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Chris, we have taken pricing. It is playing through. And we are likely to see another round
of pricing in response to some of the significant spikes in our input costs. But we feel pretty good about the way our

volumes have held up. So far, we've got good programming in place. We've used a number of promotional tactics to try
to leverage our scale; so for example, the Delicious Difference Days that we ran in France with Carrefour has been a
nice way of us helping to bridge the consumer as we've raised prices in a number of our core categories. But we feel
pretty confident that we will be able to protect our margins, not actually – certainly our dollar margins. There will be a
bit of a denominator effect as we significantly increase prices. But we feel pretty confident that we can protect our

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good afternoon.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Andrew.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: The first thing would be just you talked about how you're pretty happy with the progress in
market shares, despite obviously the pricing, the tough environment. Maybe however, you want to define it because I
know there are different ways that you track it internally. But is there a way to give us a sense overall of how that is
tracking relative to what we've seen the past couple quarters?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Certainly as we look around the world, our market shares in our core categories are holding
their own, despite the fact that in many of our categories, we were the first out in terms of pricing. I know there has
always been a great deal of interest in North America. And we feel very good about how the focus strategy that Tony
laid out is playing out behind our top 20 brands.
We've stepped up marketing investments. Our shares are improving. And I guess what is most telling is our pound
shares are quite significantly up versus prior years, despite the fact that we have an Easter shift. So, we feel very good
about the extent to which our shares have held up around the world in the face of pricing. It certainly is reflective of the
investments that we've made in our core equities, as well as in our innovation pipeline.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: And then I'm sorry if I missed this. But Tim, you said inflation was 7% to 8% in the quarter. Is
that still the estimation for full year at this stage?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yes, that's correct.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: And then last one, on the last call, I think you said that foreign exchange was as of the last call
going to be relatively neutral impact on the year. How does that shape up for you now?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Andrew, it's Dave.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Hi.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Currency on the quarter was about in line, frankly, with last year. We have a pretty broad
basket of currencies, so the implications of any currency moves get muted somewhat. If I was honest, looking at the
currencies where they sit today, it would reflect an upside versus the guidance we've given today. But as you probably
saw in the markets today, they move a lot in any given day, and I think it would be a bit early for us to bet on that and
build that in. So, we've looked at the first quarter and said it's about flat to year ago. And the guidance at this stage
reflects how we were thinking of it back then. If there is any upside, if these rates hold longer, we'll come back to you.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks, Dave, and good luck, Tim.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thank you.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Hi, Rob
<Q - Robert Moskow>: I wanted to know regarding inflation, we're getting a much higher number for inflation for
Kraft, but we're using a lot of spot markets. And I was wondering if you feel like your hedging has helped you quite a
bit this year. Do you feel like you're beating those spot markets?
And then secondly, there's been management turnover at the Cadbury side. A couple of the key people have left. And I
was wondering, Irene, if you can comment on why these people are leaving, and what kind of bench you have to
backfill. Thank you.
<A - David A. Brearton>: I can start with the commodities and Irene will talk to the management. I think our
commodity cost increases are actually quite consistent with what you're seeing from other companies. They're going to
be in the high single-digits. We have a pretty wide business across multiple geographies, so I think it would be harder
for you to model that precisely, but we're looking at high single-digit increases. We're pricing, we priced in the first
quarter to cover that. And we believe we'll be pricing to cover those as the year unfolds. So, we don't see any major
issues on commodities. We just need to keep in front of it. We need to use the end-to-end cost management to make
sure we have money to invest in the brands and innovation, which then will allow us to do that pricing. So, I think
we're pretty comfortable with the high single-digit numbers that we've given.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Rob, with respect to some of the management changes, there's no question I was sorry to
see some of our talent leave, but I feel that we've got a very strong pipeline. We've made great progress since I had first
laid out the rewiring strategy at CAGNY in 2007.
We've got a nice pipeline for most of our key positions. And it enabled us to make some very quick announcements in
the wake of the departure in snacks, Jim Chambers' departure. For example, we've got Mark Clouse stepping in to run
our snacks business. Mark was the architect of our global biscuit strategy, and he is well prepared to lead that important
business. In turn, we backfilled Mark as leader of our global biscuit category with Lorna Davis, who is the General
Manager of our China business. She actually came from the LU business initially. And she was the person who grew
with her team, grew our China business from $50 million to an over $500 million business over the last couple of years.
So, I feel very good about Lorna's experience in biscuit and her capability to add value in leading our global biscuit
team. And then in turn, we backfilled Lorna Davis with Sharon Warren, who has been the architect in our Asia-Pacific
region of the Oreo growth that I alluded to in my remarks. And so we feel very good about the pipeline, and I think you
see it playing out in this most recent announcement.

<Q - Alexia Howard>: Can I ask about the distribution trends on some of your new products in North America? You
obviously had, I guess for the first time in several years, you've got a decent lineup of new products, and those are
ramping up. Have you got further benefits to come from additional distribution gains in the second quarter, or is that
largely now behind us from Q4/Q1?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I think we have benefits that will come yet from distribution, although I feel actually quite
good about the speed with which we got a number of these innovations to market. I think our innovation pipeline is one
of the strongest we've had possibly ever, but certainly in recent memory. And the focus on fewer, bigger, faster has
really played out nicely. And so we're seeing very early wins on a number of the new items. But we do have some
incremental distribution opportunities. But also for most of these products, the marketing support will just begin to kick
in, in the second quarter. And so of course, we'll expect to see some pick-up in velocities as well. So, we feel quite
good about the innovation pipeline in the U.S., as well as elsewhere in the world, and I think it's going to be an
important contributor to our performance this year.

Your next question come the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: First, Tim, I just want to wish you good luck. And there's been a lot of moving parts in the
time that you've had this job. And you've been very helpful in helping us keep up with it. So, I want to thank you for
that and wish you good luck in the future.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Thank you, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: A couple of questions; first, in terms of the advertising and consumer spend in the quarter, if
looking at the first quarter, assuming that it was running ahead of plan, did you actually end up spending more in A&C
in the quarter than you had originally anticipated?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yes, modestly more than we had in our annual plan, but it was up about 14% from prior
year.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: The large part of that was fully planned.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then in the full-year guidance as well, has that got a higher degree of A&C
spending in it than you originally planned?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Not at this stage, Bryan; it's more or less in line with the guidance we gave at the start of
the year. So, it's more a question of the overspend in quarter one was just a bit of phasing. But right now, we're still on
track.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then just in terms of a clarification on the organic sales growth guidance for the
year, the calendar shift, I'm assuming that pulls out the extra week. Does that also normalize for some of the
calendarization changes in LU from last year?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yes. The organic revenue growth of 4%-plus that we gave excludes any calendar changes
either this year or last year. So, we've tried to keep it as clean as we can. We'll do that going forward, to make it clearer
for people how we're doing on our business.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then finally, just in terms of how we're looking at phasing out the balance of the
year, I guess there are some tailwinds in the second quarter. We'll get some benefit for Easter, but it sounds like you're

still going to be putting pricing in to cover inflation, so the net benefit of that doesn't really kick in fully until the
second half of the year. So, as we're just trying to phase the rest of the year, could you give us a little bit of color in
terms of just how to think about EPS growth or profit growth as it phases out through the balance of the year?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Sure. Yeah, we don't normally issue quarterly guidance, so I won't give you formal
guidance, but I will say a couple of things. Firstly, you're right. Organic revenue growth in quarter two will benefit
from the Easter shift, so we'll get the tailwind from the 1.5 points we talked about this quarter.
But on the EPS side, I think Tim said in our last earnings call that we would have more normal seasonality of our EPS
this year. Last year was a bit of an anomaly. If you look back over time, we've traditionally delivered a little less than
half of our earnings in the first half, around 48%, and about 52% in the back half, just because of the seasonality of
some of our products. This year, we would expect to be in line with that historical trend; whereas last year, for a lot of
reasons, it was the reverse. We actually had a higher profit delivery in the first half last year than we did this year.
In terms of comparisons, our comparisons are going to be tougher in first half than the back half. It's not because of
anything this year. It's not because of pressures we're seeing. We're actually quite comfortable that 2011 will be a good
earnings profile across the year. We're just comparing against an unusual 2010.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then if I could just sneak one more in, Irene, just in terms of pricing to inflation
in developing markets, has it become more difficult to take price increases that cover or even more than cover inflation
this year than maybe has been the case last year or the year before?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I think we're seeing some sensitivity. And so there's no question that it is a little bit more
difficult. But as you can see from our results, about half and half – our revenue was about half and half vol/mix and
pricing. And so we've been able to get those price increases through, again, because of the investments that we've made
in our core franchises.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, thanks.

<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Maybe I missed it, but did you give an organic sales number for Cadbury in the quarter?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, we're not – at this point, the business is fully integrated, so we gave the organic number
for the entire company.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay, and there are no comments that you want to make other than the gum comments that
were made earlier?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, I think it has been in line with our expectations, as I've said, other than the one issue.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: And then one last one, last quarter, you brought back out the U.S. revenue metric that was
gaining share, and it was a very impressive number. Do you have that number for this quarter as well?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: As I mentioned earlier, we feel very good about the fact that we're holding or growing share
in the majority of the business, despite the fact that we did take pricing and we've seen a shift in Easter. So, we're
certainly way up in where we would hope to be. And as I mentioned, on volume basis we feel very good that we're in
the 80% range. We feel quite good about that.

Your next question comes from the line of Terry Bivens with JPMorgan.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Hello, Terry.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: I just have two, I think, relatively quick things. Irene, this gets back to Alexia's question on
distribution. At least in the syndicated data, it seems to be roughly equal with last year. I would have probably expected
it to be up a little, but it gets back to Wal-Mart in a way. So, Action Alley hasn't really come back like we might have
thought a year ago or so. Do you think that's a fair statement from your point of view?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: It has come back. I would say that we certainly are seeing better trends. It's not quite yet
where we'd like it to be. But we certainly are – we did not find that we lost a lot of distribution as part of their change in
strategy. So, you wouldn't have expected that as an impact on our distribution numbers. The numbers that we look at,
we are gaining distribution in aggregate, partly related to the fact that we've got some very strong new products, as I
mentioned earlier.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay, thank you for that. And just in terms of the revenue synergies, I was certainly surprised to
see how well Oreo is doing over in India. I believe you set a goal for $1 billion, if I'm remembering correctly. I don't
have that in front of me. But could you just talk for a minute about how the revenue synergies part of the Cadbury
acquisition is going? And that's it for me. Thank you.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yes, we feel good, Terry. You're right, we set a target of about $1 billion, and we think
we're on track to deliver that. We said about 0.5 point of our growth in 2011 would come from our revenue synergies.
But I think there is a whole host of examples. Certainly, India is one good example where we've been able to put both
Oreo and Tang through the chocolate distribution network to terrific results. In Brazil, we're currently expanding our
base legacy Kraft products into almost 700,000 outlets, up from less than 300,000. So, we're seeing – and that has been
an important contributor to our high double-digit growth in Brazil.
Mexico, I talked about the fact that we've been able to put Oreo that was only in about 100,000 outlets into Cadbury's
380,000 outlets that they had with the gum business. Russia, we're seeing some opportunity to be able to put the total
portfolio together.
And even just some simple merchandising ideas; there were some small retail refrigerators that Cadbury used in India
for their chocolate business that we've now been able to take to use for cheese in markets like Indonesia, and for
chocolate in markets like Brazil. So, there's a whole host of examples.
But as we've shared with you, most of the $1 billion of revenue synergies will come in 2012/2013.

channels. Is that still the case, or is there a slowdown in the channels? And can you talk about the distribution between
the different alternative channels?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, we're having terrific performance in the alternative channels, mid to high-teens growth
rates in drugs, in mass, in dollar, so we feel very good. Particularly now with the stronger portfolio, we have a wider
range of offerings for a number of these channels; and that's playing out quite well for us. It's an important part of our
growth. And we like it a lot because typically there's a lot less competition there, and we like the margins.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. And then the second question I have is you talked a couple of points about certain
power brands. Can you round it out a little bit with a couple more comments about other power brands that you didn't
actually talk about in your notes, just seeing how everything else did?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I think we gave you by geography; in North America, our power brands grew about 4%.
And in fact, if you look at our top 20 brands, 15 of the top 20 grew more than 5%. So, we feel very good about the
performance in North America. As we talked about in Europe, we grew an aggregate 4%. Our power brands grew over
6%. And in developing markets, where we grew almost 10%, our power brands grew 16%.
So behind that, we've given you a couple numbers. We talked about Oreo up 56%. I talked about Cadbury Dairy Milk,
up almost 20%. We've got a number of very good stories behind each of those aggregate numbers, but it would be a
little bit late to go into all of them. I think we've given you a good flavor for them.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Are there any ones that we should be – that might need a little bit more advertising or new
product innovation that might not have performed yet that might be coming online? I guess that's really what I'm trying
to get at.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I think certainly, products like MiO are just getting started. It's really a beverage. We served
it to you at CAGNY. It's a water enhancer, and people are just beginning to get it in their hands. We have high hopes
for it. We're just getting started. But we've got a pretty good pipeline. Certainly, as I mentioned, our innovations are out
in the market for the most part, but they're just beginning to get consumer support. So, we do expect that the
performance of those products will accelerate as we move along.
Tim mentioned the products in Europe. In the U.K., our Millicano coffee product, we have great hopes for that one, and
it's off to a good start. Our chocolate Philadelphia with Milka is off to a very good start. We're actually selling more
than we can make. I think if we go around the world, we feel very good about the pipeline, and we do feel very good
about the marketing support behind the pipeline.
But I'll tell you, when I look at businesses like Tang, it took us 50 years to build Tang to a $500 million business. And
in the last three years, we've essentially doubled that. And Tang is almost a billion-dollar brand in developing markets.
So, we talked about brands like Oreo that are quite mature that are growing like teenagers. Many of these established
brands are responding quite well to the marketing support and to the innovation in the marketing, as well as some of the
new products that I talked about.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great, I appreciate it. Thank you.

<Q - Diane Geissler>: I guess my question really is about what are you seeing in the competitive set. Irene, you talked
about your performance on a volume basis if we account for the Easter shift, which is fairly solid given the pricing that
you've put into place. Are you seeing your competitors price behind you now? And is it your expectation that you
continue to see this sort of volume traction? Could you just talk a little bit, particularly in categories where you do have
significant private label competition?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I do feel good. We've been able to take pricing. Our shares are holding up well, as we've
said. We have found in most of our categories that we have priced earlier than many of our competitors. And the reality
is always that costs are going up for everyone, and so we would expect over time that we will see prices increase across
the board for our customers, as well as for our branded competitors.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: And are you seeing that on the shelf now, or do you think there's still a lag between – because if
you go back all the way to the third quarter of 2010 is when you really started to take the pricing. It seems to me that
we should have seen some of your other competitors pricing behind you, so I guess -
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Most of our categories – given the extreme spike that we have seen in input costs, it is
almost impossible not to price them, and we're seeing that playing out. Some people, some businesses have done it at
different rates than others. We're starting to see it play out in the marketplace. But as Dave said, it's one of the reasons
that we are cautious about our guidance because we feel very good about where we are so far, but we do need to
continue to see this play out. But I would say in general, we are finding that our elasticities are holding up better than
we might have thought.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay. Are there any particular categories you would highlight where you think there needs to
be further pricing? I know it's broad-based commodity inflation, but particularly thinking of things like the meat
category, dairy?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I'm not going to get into any specifics, but I think you can see we're the largest spikes have
been.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Hi, everyone.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Hi, Judy.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: A question about capital allocation and just your thought about your portfolio. So, on the capital
allocation side, we're seeing share count creep up a little bit as options get diluted. You're going to end this year with
roughly three times leverage. Financing costs are pretty attractive. You get potential proceeds from Starbucks. So, can
you just give us a perspective on when you would feel comfortable maybe buying back stock?
And then on the portfolio side, it looks like we're seeing increased deal activity in the space, so any thoughts in terms of
looking at your broader portfolio, how you could participate? I'm looking at maybe some of the brands or non-core
products that you could potentially sell.
<A - David A. Brearton>: I think right now, we're pretty focused on getting to the leverage targets that we've laid out
through both EBITDA growth, as well as the natural maturity of our existing debt. When we get to that point, we will,
obviously, consider all options. So, that will be a discussion with the Board. So, I don't think we can go into that here.
In terms of M&A, we never comment on M&A. So, I'm sorry, we won't be able to do that here. But we're happy with
the portfolio we've got right now. And our focus is really on driving top tier growth, top line and bottom line, with the

<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And your earlier comment about just focusing on debt reduction and getting to the
leverage target, how would that focus change if you did get sizeable proceeds from Starbucks?
<A - David A. Brearton>: At this point, I don't want to get into a hypothetical discussion on any Starbucks proceeds.
We need to let that process play through.

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Thanks, good afternoon, everybody.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Ed.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: I wanted to just circle back to the discussion earlier about the phasing of the year in terms of
quarters. I think your comment implied maybe a mid-$0.50s type of number for the second quarter, which would put a
pretty strong onus on the back half in terms of – from a year-over-year growth perspective to get to the numbers on a
full-year basis, something in the range of 20% to 25% in the back half. I guess I know in Q4, you had some margin
pressure. But it doesn't strike me as having been anything so unique about last year from a comparison standpoint to
cause such a big growth rate this year. So, I was just hoping you could help me understand that a little better.
<A - David A. Brearton>: I would go back to – this year is going to be pretty normal. So, I would not get hung up on
the growth rate versus last year. Last year was the anomaly. So, this year, we will have an earnings profile across the
quarters that is going to be pretty much in line with prior years with, as I said, about 48% in the first half and roughly
52% in the second half would be our normal historical levels. And there are some things that you just have to keep in
mind as we go into quarter two, the Easter shift, just that normal distribution. And as well, we're going to see the
mark-to-market reverse out.
The mathematical calculation of what that means to growth in the back half, again, I think I would look at that as part
of ongoing historical profile rather than versus last year. We had an unusually high earnings level in the first half last
year, and equally and an unusually lower earnings level in the back half. Yes, it will mathematically look like a big step
up. But we're pretty comfortable that the profile this year is more normal, and it will reflect our ongoing business
profile.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: The profile last year is 54%/46%; and normalized is more 48%/52%, so we're expecting
to revert back to normal.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Okay, and then one follow-up, if I could, just on the coffee change with Starbucks. It looks like
there was an $87 million divestiture in the quarter. I guess if that's – you only didn't have that business for one month
out of the quarter, and $87 million seems like a high number for one month. Am I missing something there?
<A - David A. Brearton>: The number you're looking at on the chart was actually the takeout Starbucks revenue out
of both years. So, the $87 million was actually taking out January and February.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Understood, thank you.

<Q - Eric Serotta>: Thank you for taking the question. Most of my questions have been answered at this point. But
could you touch upon the U.S. grocery segment? It seems that you had really some of the largest volume declines there.
Was that a segment where competitors were late to follow?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Actually, the biggest impact in our grocery segment was Easter. That is, of all of our
businesses, we've got a lot of products in there that are very sensitive to Easter, Macaroni & Cheese and sold stuff in
1:01:10 a number of products. Our JELL-O business, our Cool Whip business, all of those are highly sensitive to
Easter, and that was the major driver of the net revenue decline. I'm quite comfortable that we will see over the first
half positive organic growth in that business unit.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay, thanks. Then did you give what the target is for A&C increase for this year?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No. As we've said, we have a longer term target of getting ourselves in the 8% to 9% range,
and I think we're on track to continue to make good progress.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay. With that, I'll pass it on.
Christopher M. Jakubik
Okay. I think we can end it there. I appreciate everybody listening today. And for those of you in the media that have
questions, Mike Mitchell will be available to take your calls. And for the analysts who have further follow-up, Dexter
Congbalay and myself will be available. Thanks very much and have a good day.
