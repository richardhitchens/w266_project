Good morning and thanks for your interest in Lowe's.
This quarter, we delivered comparable sales growth of 1.9%, driven by a 3.5% increase in average ticket, partially
offset by a 1.5% decline in transactions stemming from weaker outdoor performance. We posted positive comps in 8 of
11 product categories while one category was flat. A solid macro backdrop combined with our project expertise drove
above-average performance in indoor project categories across the appliances, kitchens, and flooring categories.
We also continued to advance our sales to Pros customers, driving outperformance in rough plumbing and electrical,
lumber and building materials, and tools and hardware. We drove 27% comp growth on Lowes.com and above-average
comps in in-home sales, demonstrating the continued strength of our omni-channel foundation. Our ability to connect
with customers in our stores, online, through our contact centers, or in their homes ensures that we provide solutions to
customers across the most relevant moments of their project journey.
We're pleased with the progress we've made to enhance our product and service offering for the Pro customer,
delivering another quarter of comps well above the company average. And we continue to expand our capabilities to
better serve this growing customer group. Last week, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire Maintenance Supply Headquarters, a leading distributor of maintenance, repair, and operations or MRO
products to the multifamily housing industry in the Southeast, South Central, and West. This is an important step in our
strategy to deepen and broaden our relationship with Pro customers and better serve their needs.
When combined with our November 2016 acquisition of Central Wholesalers, a prominent MRO distributor in the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, this acquisition will substantially expand our ability to serve the multifamily housing
industry as both a primary and secondary supplier, while also increasing our presence in major metro markets and
strengthening our foundation for future growth. This combined multifamily MRO business is expected to generate
more than $400 million in annual sales, with 16 distribution centers and over 200 additional outside sales
representatives.
From a geographic standpoint, our U.S. business achieved 2% comps for the quarter, with positive comps in 12 of 14
regions. Internationally, we delivered double-digit comps in Mexico, while comps in Canada were flat in local
currency. Canadian comps were pressured by unusually high snowfall in addition to four years of high single to
double-digit comps.
Last week marked an important milestone, the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of RONA. This acquisition has
fortified our presence in Canada with a market-proven asset. We remain excited by the compelling opportunity to bring
together Lowe's global scale and resources with RONA's local expertise, and we're well positioned to capitalize on the
market's strong long-term fundamentals.
We're pleased with early wins in key synergy areas such as: introducing our best-in-class appliance offering in
RONA-branded stores, serving a new portion of the market and positioning us to capture additional market share;
building out our e-commerce capabilities which are already delivering strong growth above initial expectations;
converting as many as six RONA big-box stores to Lowe's branded stores in fiscal 2017; and driving improved
profitability by leveraging our shared supplier relationships. Through the great work of our Lowe's Canada team, we
have begun unlocking the value of the acquisition and remain confident that we will deliver the revenue and cost
synergies we expected.
For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $0.70. These results included a $464 million pre-tax loss associated
with the early extinguishment of debt from our recent tender offer. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, an 18%
increase over last year's adjusted earnings per share. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to
shareholders, in the quarter we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $304
million in dividends.
Turning to the economic landscape for the balance of the year, the home improvement industry should continue to see
solid gains. Job and income growth should drive solid gains in both disposable income and consumer spending. And
revolving credit usage remains favorable, supplementing the spending power generated by stronger incomes and
supporting bigger ticket purchases.

Housing is expected to remain a bright spot. Increasing household formation is encouraging and is expected to continue
amid steady job gains. Home price appreciation should persist, as mortgage rates have eased from their post-election
increase, which will support home affordability. And as we survey the consumer, we're seeing similar favorable trends.
Our most recent consumer sentiment survey revealed that homeowners have an increasingly favorable view of the
national economy and their personal financial situation.
Rising home prices are continuing to encourage homeowners to engage in more discretionary projects in addition to
ongoing maintenance and repair spending, and we believe that this trend will continue, as well over half of
homeowners we surveyed believe their home values will continue to increase. Also, nearly half of homeowners we
surveyed indicated that they intend to engage in a home improvement project in the next six months, and home
improvement spending is expected to continue to outpace overall spending.
As we reflect on the quarter, we're very pleased with the continued growth of our Pro customer sales and excited about
the opportunity we have to further expand that business and gain additional market share. For the DIY customer, we
recognize the near-term opportunity we have to drive more traffic with improved messaging and an optimized
promotion strategy. Mike will share more with you on that in a moment.
Longer term, we continue to focus on actions and invest in capabilities that will add the most value for customers and
shareholders. We're focused on omni-channel project experiences and expanding the reach of home improvement,
ultimately serving more customers, more effectively. We're developing capabilities to anticipate and support customers'
evolving needs. We're also focused on improving operating discipline and execution, and are committed to making
productivity the core strength for Lowe's.
Before I close, I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and ongoing commitment to anticipating and serving
customers' needs. Our employees are truly the foundation of our business.
Thanks again for your interest and, with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.
Michael P. McDermott
Thanks, Robert, and good morning everyone.
In the first quarter, we achieved positive comps in 12 of 14 regions, and posted positive comps in 8 of 11 product
categories, while one category was flat. We delivered a comp of 1.9% on top of 7.3% last year, despite softer
performance in outdoor categories, which gave rise to a modest decline in transactions.
As you know, Lowe's has built a very strong seasonal business over the years, with approximately 35% of Q1 and 40%
of Q2 sales historically driven by outdoor categories. Given the tough comparison to Q1 last year, we designed a spring
strategy intended to balance indoor and outdoor projects. However, as the quarter unfolded, we found we weighted our
messaging too heavily towards indoor categories. We made the appropriate adjustments to our messaging mid-quarter
and saw corresponding improvement in April.
As we look to capitalize on strong demand for indoor projects and customers' continued desire to invest in their homes
with our project inspiration and expertise and targeted promotions, we drove above-average comps in interior
categories such as appliances, kitchens and flooring. Once again, we achieved strong comps in appliances, leveraging
our investments in customer experience both in-store and online. In-store, our appliance suites allow customers to
visualize how their appliance purchase will look in their refreshed or remodeled kitchen. Online, we've enhanced the
customer experience and presentation to make it easy for customers to select their products.
Our omni-channel customer experience together with leading brands, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing,
knowledgeable sales specialists, as well as delivery and haul-away service continues to drive our performance in
appliances. Kitchens also benefited from our omni-channel customer experience. In order to provide a holistic project
solution to a simple kitchen refresh or a full remodel, we display our kitchen solutions, including cabinets and
countertops immediately adjacent to our appliance offering, so customers can both envision and design their dream

kitchens.
Following the trend from last quarter, we again drove above-average comps in kitchens through a combination of
project, inspiration and expertise, our investment in project specialists and targeted events. We also drove
above-average comps in flooring, leveraging our strong assortment as well as targeted promotions to capture indoor
projects.
We continue to advance our Pro customer sales, driving comps well above the company average by further optimizing
our product and service offering to better serve the Pro. We achieved strong comps in lumber and building materials,
driven by strong Pro demand, continued recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew and Louisiana flooding and
inflation. Pro activity also drove solid comps in rough plumbing and electrical, and tools and hardware.
We captured Pro sales by improving our brand assortment with exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the number one
and number two brands in pneumatics, and the extension of brands like Vaughan, Owens Corning and GAF. We
continue to be excited about the effectiveness of destination brands in attracting Pro customers.
This strength is evidenced with the addition of Marshalltown, a trusted Pro brand and a leading supplier of masonry
tools, which drove double-digit comps in the category. In addition to our outstanding portfolio of brands, we're also
deepening and broadening our relationship with the Pro customer with our strong value proposition, as well as
advancing our capabilities to connect with Pro seamlessly across channels through LowesForPros.com and our growing
Pro services team.
The addition of Central Wholesalers, along with our pending acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters, further
expands our capabilities to serve multifamily property management customers throughout the country with enhanced
product and service offering, while strengthening our platform for future growth with this important customer. We
continue to drive Pro awareness with targeted marketing, including expanded digital capabilities, as well as Pro
exclusive offers, to grow our share of wallet with existing Pros, while also generating new business. We've also
enhanced our Buy in Bulk program, with new signage in-store, messaging on LowesForPros.com, and marketing
campaigns designed to drive awareness of the great values we provide for the Pro.
Our focus on further strengthening our portfolio of brands, continuing to build upon our omni-channel offering through
our growing Pro services team, and LowesForPros.com are all part of a broader commitment to build our strong
foundation to anticipate and serve the needs of the Pro customer. We also continue to focus on our strategic priorities,
leveraging our omni-channel capabilities to help customers achieve great project results.
Customers can engage with our associates in-store for expert advice, on Lowes.com for content and inspiration, with
our contact center for ongoing support, or with our project specialists to bring their solutions to life. As customers
engaged in both indoor and outdoor projects, we leveraged our omni-channel capabilities to help them throughout their
project journey, driving 27% comp growth on Lowes.com and above-average comps for in-home sales.
Our interior and exterior project specialists represent another important element of our omni-channel strategy, as they
serve the do-it-for-me customer, who needs a bit more help navigating their project; meeting them in their homes to
design, plan, pull together products across multiple categories and manage their project through to completion. We're
also advancing our omni-channel experience, making it even easier for customers to engage with our in-home project
specialists. On Lowes.com, we've added online scheduling capabilities to our in-home selling model, and we've seen a
very strong response to these enhancements with increased leads and appointment requests.
For the quarter, gross margin contracted 64 basis points. We had 35 basis points of impact from product mix and
RONA. The remainder of the decline was primarily the result of promotional activity, inflation predominantly in
lumber, and pricing investments in key product categories. Looking ahead, we're working to refine our promotional
strategy by improving the balance between big ticket and smaller ticket projects, eliminating less effective promotions,
and reducing the overall margin impact to the business.
We continue to make progress in driving productivity throughout the enterprise, while investing in the areas that matter
most to customers. This quarter, we drove 40 basis points of payroll leverage as we realized the benefits of our new

store staffing model. We took decisive action to design and implement a new structure that provides better leadership
and accountability, allowing us to grow sales with more efficient staffing.
We're also working to drive productivity in our supply chain by introducing new international carriers into our system
and realigning our network to balance our volumes against three new shipping alliances in Southeast Asia. As these
improvements are implemented, they're expected to benefit gross margin in the back half of the year.
As we look forward to the remainder of 2017, we're proud to welcome two new additions to our outstanding portfolio
of brands that appeal specifically to Pro customers; SharkBite, the industry leader in plumbing fittings and A. O. Smith,
the leading brand of residential water heaters. And for DIY customers, we're leveraging our MyLowes platform to drive
additional brand loyalty.
We're proud to announce that we've simplified our military discount program by allowing active duty and veterans to
register through MyLowes. We're also offering free parcel shipping exclusively for MyLowes members. And as we
move to Q2, we look forward to our compelling Memorial Day, Father's Day and July 4th events, as well as our
outdoor entertaining event featuring unique omni-channel experiences, such as online tools to build the ideal backyard
retreat.
We are well positioned to capitalize on a favorable macroeconomic backdrop for home improvement, as we continue to
execute on our strategic priorities and make progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth while improving
operating discipline, productivity, and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the
course of the year.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I'll now turn the call over to Marshall.
Marshall A. Croom
Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.
Sales for the first quarter were $16.9 billion, an increase of 10.7%. Total customer transactions increased 6.4%, and
total average ticket increased 4% to $70.79. Our transaction growth was aided by the addition of RONA. RONA's sales
were approximately $630 million, or 4.2% of sales growth. As a reminder, RONA is not included on our comp
calculations until the second quarter of this year.
As a result of the calendar shift from the 53rd week of fiscal 2016, this year's first quarter included one less week of
winter and one more week of spring than last year. While this had no impact on comp sales, it did benefit first quarter
total sales by approximately $500 million, contributing 3.6% to sales growth. Comp sales were 1.9%, driven by an
average ticket increase of 3.5%, partially offset by a transaction decline of 1.5%.
Looking at monthly trends, comps were positive, 3.8% in February, negative 1.2% in March, and a positive 4.0% in
April. Lastly, new stores drove 100 basis points of total growth.
Gross margin for the first quarter was 34.4% of sales and, as Mike mentioned, decreased 64 basis points from the first
quarter of last year. We had a combined 35 basis points of impact from product mix and RONA combined. The
remainder of the decline was primarily the result of promotional activity to match the intensity of the marketplace,
inflation, primarily driven by lumber, and pricing investments in key product categories.
SG&A for the quarter was 22.99% to sales, which deleveraged 73 basis points. The deleverage was driven by the
comparison to an unrealized gain in last year's first quarter when we recorded $160 million associated with the foreign
currency hedge we entered into in advance of the RONA acquisition. This year-over-year comparison drove 105 basis
points of expense deleverage.
And in the first quarter of this year, we experienced 40 basis points of payroll leverage in the stores, as we realized the
benefits of our new store staffing model. We also experienced 37 basis points of leverage in incentive compensation
due to lower attainment levels relative to last year. Somewhat offsetting these items was deleverage from our private

label credit portfolio due to an increase in program costs, driven by higher losses as well as risk insurance, which was
driven by a favorable actuarial adjustment last year that didn't repeat this year.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $365 million, which was 2.1% of sales and leveraged 20 basis points.
Operating income decreased 117 basis points to 9.25% of sales. The RONA impacts associated with the mix of
business and integration costs negatively impacted operating income by approximately 65 basis points in the quarter.
Additionally, the comparison to the prior-year unrealized gain of the foreign currency hedge negatively impacted
operating income by 105 basis points.
This quarter we completed a cash tender offer for $1.6 billion of our higher coupon bonds. And as a result, we
recognized a $464 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt. To fund the tender offer and finance current year
maturities, we issued $3 billion of unsecured bonds in April. The issuance consisted of 10 and 30-year notes with a
weighted average interest rate of 3.58%. For the quarter, interest expense was $161 million. The effective tax rate for
the quarter was 35.5% compared to 38.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The year-over-year change in our effective
tax rate was primarily driven by the implementation of a new accounting standard for excess tax benefits associated
with share-based compensation.
Earnings per share was $0.70 for the first quarter, including a benefit of approximately $0.06 from the calendar week
shift. The loss associated with the early extinguishment of debt reduced EPS by approximately $0.33 for the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.03, an 18% increase over last year's adjusted earnings per share of $0.87.
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was
$1.96 billion. The lower cash balance this year is the result of a larger April 2016 bond issuance in anticipation of the
RONA acquisition. Inventory was at nearly $12.3 billion at the end of the quarter and increased $1.2 billion or 10.8%
versus the first quarter of last year, with roughly 60% of the increase related to the addition of RONA. Inventory
turnover was 3.95, an increase of 12 basis points over the first quarter of last year. Asset turnover increased 5 basis
points to 1.83.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, accounts payable was $9.9 billion, representing a $1.1 billion or
12.3% increase over the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the timing of purchases year over year, terms
improvement, as well as the addition of RONA. At the end of the first quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was
12.27 (sic) [2.27] times. Return on invested capital was 15.6%. The prior year charges offset by the net gain on the
foreign currency hedge related to the RONA acquisition negatively impacted return on invested capital by 225 basis
points.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows, operating cash flow was $3.3 billion and capital expenditures were $202
million, resulting in free cash flow of nearly $3.1 billion, which was up 2.7% to last year. In March, we entered into a
$500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement which settled in the quarter for approximately 6.1 million shares.
We also repurchased approximately 9.2 million shares or $750 million through the open market. As Robert mentioned,
in total, we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock in the quarter. We have approximately $3.8 billion remaining on our share
repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in our Lowe's business outlook. We expect to recover
our first quarter sales miss over the next two quarters by increasing our media weight with a focus on value, improving
our promotional effectiveness, and rebalancing our indoor/outdoor strategy. As a result, we are reaffirming our
operating outlook for the year.
We expect a total sales increase of approximately 5% and this sales increase is driven by a number of factors. First, we
are forecasting comp sales increase of approximately 3.5%. Second, the RONA acquisition drives about 2% sales
growth. Also, we plan to open 35 stores, which adds roughly 1%. To offset that, total sales growth will be reduced
roughly by 1.5% to the comparison of 52 weeks in 2017 versus 53 weeks in 2016.
On a GAAP basis, we are anticipating an operating margin increase of approximately 120 basis points. Regarding
operating margin, a full year of RONA results versus roughly seven months last year will pressure operating margin by

an estimated 15 to 20 basis points for 2017. Effective tax rate is expected to be 37.8% for 2017. For the year, on a
GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.30. Please refer to page 13 in our supplemental
reference slides for a summary of adjustments as you compare 2017 to 2016.
We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.9 billion, and capital expenditures of
approximately $1.4 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of approximately $4.5 billion for 2017. Our
guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for this year.
Regina, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Is your decision to make price
investments in response to something that you're seeing in the marketplace, or is it more proactive in an effort to regain
some of the share that seems like you might be losing today?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Michael, throughout the quarter – this is Mike McDermott, throughout the quarter we
saw an opportunity to improve our DIY value perception. We feel good about our competitiveness, our assortments,
our brand portfolio and the innovation we're bringing to market, but we've had to adjust our marketing to more
frequently include lower price point values that are already in place throughout our product offering to drive increased
traffic.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: So, it seems like you're maybe making some changes in response to the market. Are you
seeing pressure from more of your big box competitors, or is it coming from the online channel?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: I think we're seeing a significant opportunity in both DIY and Pro, as home
improvement continues to do very well. As it relates to the competitors, there are many, as you know, many
competitors in the marketplace and we've got to face them all.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. And my follow-up question is on the outlook for the year. So, the first quarter fell
short of where you thought it was going to be. You're going be a little bit more price competitive. So, to still achieve
your prior expectations, is it that sales will come in better than what you previously thought, or you're going to find
other ways to offset some of the cost pressure – some of the margin pressure you might feel from the price
investments?
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: It's really the latter. We're looking at geography shift with the gross margin pressure we
experienced in the first quarter. We're going to experience pressure for the year in total, and we're anticipating roughly
20 basis points. But we do expect to be able to offset that on the SG&A line as we're going to get some visibility and
traction through our productivity efforts.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Thank you so much.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Mike.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks, good morning, maybe a question for Mike on the marketing. I think over the
summer or maybe postmortem from looking at last year, you talked about a little too much marketing geared towards
the millennial and then this quarter we heard maybe you were more indoor-oriented and maybe this quarter was just a

tactical change in how the seasons and sales were playing out. But how do you feel about the marketing plan the rest of
the year? And I'm sure you want to avoid these type of missteps if you characterize on that and how do you do that?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: I'll tell you, we continue, Simeon, to optimize our media and improve our flexibility
and responsiveness to the market opportunity and the weather, ultimately driving improved productivity as we spend –
on the spend and as we continue to drive traffic. We tried to toggle in and out of weather opportunities throughout the
quarter and found that we sub-optimize. Our objective, obviously, is to better connect with our customers through more
personalized messaging tailored to their specific needs, and we continue to build capabilities to do that. We'll also
continue to look for the most effective and efficient ways to drive traffic and build our brand across all of our assets.
So, that continues to be something that we fine-tune over time.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And my follow-up is on RONA. Can you talk about when? I think you said after
Q2, that comes into the comp base, what kind of comp lift should we assume and then the timing and magnitude of
synergies as they flow through?
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: So, Simeon, this is Marshall. I'll address the RONA question. Basically, it will come in
towards the tail end of the second quarter. Then, we'll be able to roll that into our comp numbers for the company. And
once we do that, we've already baked that into our guidance for the year.
<A - Richard D. Maltsbarger>: And this is also Richard. To play off what Marshall said there, as well as the comp
guidance, all the synergies that we have for the year have also been baked into the guidance that was provided for the
year.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dolph B. Warburton>: Hi. This is Dolph on for Dan. Thank you for taking my question. Around the
outperformance of the Pro category, are you able to quantify how much faster Pro grew or how many bps above the
average Pro-category Pro sales grew?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: This is Robert. I'll just say, overall, as Mike alluded to in his comments, we have been
investing heavily in the Pro. Recently, certainly with the addition of things like Marshalltown, SharkBite more recently
and A.O. Smith, as well as the other initiatives we've had over the past few years, the launch of LowesForPros.com,
[indiscernible] (36:04). So I would just say that we saw a significant growth in the Pro customer, more than 2X our
overall comp.
And then when we take – and then, as I said in my comments and how I did the acquisition of Maintenance Supply
Headquarters, the definitive agreement, and we'll get that acquisition closed. Combining that with Central, I think it's
just going to give us opportunity to continue to perpetuate the great momentum that we had with the Pro customer. So,
really pleased with what the team delivered in the first quarter, and also really excited about the opportunity that lies
ahead as we continue to deepen our relationship, particularly with the opportunity we see in the MRO business.
<Q - Dolph B. Warburton>: Okay, thank you. And if I could ask one last question, I think you mentioned some
deleverage on some credit costs. Can you give us an idea of where credit – Lowe's card penetration is now? And does
the deleverage this quarter have you rethinking any terms or standards for that card? Thank you.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: I'll just say that our credit card penetration for our private label brand is roughly 28%.
So, we've seen that steadily grow over time, so we look at the overall portfolio. Just keep in mind that we are coming
off of historically low delinquency rates and loss rates. So, we're beginning to see a little bit of inflection there.
We believe that our portfolio is performing relatively well versus others in the marketplace, but something we will keep
an eye on. You have to be sensitive to how you adjust those terms for your customers, because we do see this as a sales

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Thanks. You all talked about in 4Q a big focus on productivity in the business. I'm curious, as
you look at 1Q and as you look out through the balance of the year, what ranks kind of first on the emphasis in that area
looking at this quarter with gross margin and SG&A and sales? I'm just curious what's at the top of the list when you
think about productivity as you define it with the metric that you're most focused on achieving or improving.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Eric, as we talked about on the fourth quarter call and our Analyst Day in December, we are
increasing our operating discipline and our focus on productivity across the business to drive a core strength and a core
mindset. The big thing we want to make sure that we get across is this laser focus on productivity doesn't deflect or
detract from our efforts to continue to drive our customer-centric omni-channel strategic initiatives. In fact, we see
them as complementary. We believe this will continue to allow us to invest and grow in those key areas as the
consumer continues to shift.
In the quarter, we really focused on two areas. First, that was the rollout and the change of our store staffing models,
which was in place to help us drive improved leadership across the store, improved training and oversight to drive a
better customer experience across the store. And we also changed our management complement here at the CSC
[Customer Support Center] to drive to drive a leaner organization, to become more nimble and drive more speed of
decision-making. So we're very pleased with how both those initiatives are going and how the organization has
responded to those actions.
As we think broader about productivity, we're really focused on a few key areas as we continue to move forward, some
that are strictly productivity initiatives, others which we believe will have consumer experience impact as well. First,
expanding our central production offices will continue to be a focus as we look to expand that into our Southern
division during the second half of the year, which really improves the communication of our installed sales business,
drives it into our contact centers from the store model, improving our communication and efficiency and connectivity
to the customer during that complex install process.
We're also optimizing our freight flow from the distribution centers. Mike spoke about that earlier, as we look to
optimize lanes and flow, as well as how we flow the product to the customer, as this is the single biggest utilization of
non-selling labor in the stores. So the teams are continuing to focus on how to get more effective, more efficient there.
Third, we continue to have alternate delivery options. We have supervised delivery tests ongoing in four markets
currently, both small, medium and large to understand how we optimize our delivery networks more effectively, more
efficiently. And then we'll continue to leverage our indirect sourcing opportunities across the enterprise to get stronger.
So the core aspects of productivity we think will continue to drive the organization and help us deliver against our
targets for the second half of the year. And we're pleased with the outcomes that's been implemented to date.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: I guess just one follow-up. When you talk about the outcomes, and great job on leveraging
payroll and leveraging SG&A. Is that the scoreboard you're focused on? How are you balancing that relative to
growing sales and sales productivity and market share? How are you thinking about balancing those two?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Eric, the big things that we look at when we're looking at it from a store standpoint is holistic
measures of success from efficiency of process through our customer service metric. So we're measuring our close rate
performances, we're measuring our customer satisfaction scores, I would say are the two dominant drivers of our
overall measurement of success. And then we'll continue to measure it against the anticipated benefits that we have
wound out. So we're pleased with what we saw across both those attributes in the quarter. As a matter of fact, we saw

increases in our overall customer satisfaction scores compared to Q1 2016. So, really proud of the way the teams in the
field have rallied around this and responded and continue to work to meet the needs of our customers in the aisles every
day.
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: And, Eric, this is Marshall. I'll just follow on just real briefly that we're looking for ways
to drive sales productivity, so anything to do with process and capabilities that we need to deliver to drive better sales
productivity, as well as keeping an eye on our expenses, eliminating waste, and are there more effective ways to utilize
our spend. So I hope that helps.
And if I could just inject one clarification, I just received a note that the lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR, it's 2.27
times. I think I said 12.27 times. The rating agencies are on the line. I don't want to get them too excited, but it's 2.27
times, and we anticipate getting to 2.21 by the end of the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the sales performance in the quarter being
a little bit lighter than you expected. Can you just clarify? Do you think that was driven by some seasonal factors, or
was there more of a share loss component here and that's why you're making some of the promotional changes?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Seth, this is Robert Niblock. I'll start. As we look at the quarter, as we indicated, there were
certainly some weather challenges that impacted our seasonal performance. As you know, seasonal is a big category for
us. We had strong comps that we were going up against last year from a seasonal standpoint. So as Mike indicated, part
of what was done with the heavy reliance on seasonal was to try and pursue some opportunity that we saw in indoor
categories.
As we toggled between those two, we recognized that we probably had some opportunity to continue to improve our
messaging around seasonal categories, value-driving and traffic-driving items. So Mike and his team started making
those necessary adjustments. But when we look at the quarter, as we look at it on balance, even with weather
challenges, we were only slightly below our plan for the quarter. So all in all, considering weather, we ended up with a
good performance against our plan. And as we said, we're making adjustments to continue to capitalize on opportunity
that we see in the market.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Got it. And then the regions and the categories that did underperform in the quarter, did you see
signs of improvement late in the quarter in April? And if you could just give us a general sense of how you're feeling
about May, because it does seem like there's some confidence that the business is going to re-accelerate. Thanks.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: We did see the most significant pressure in our lawn and garden, and seasonal and
outdoor living business. From a lawn and garden perspective, we saw some inconsistent performance throughout the
quarter, really aligned with that weather that Robert just talked about, leading to a slightly negative comp. We weren't
able to offset the underperformance in live goods with some of the positive performance in other areas in that division.
But certainly, as weather has improved, we have seen improvement there as well as in our seasonal and outdoor living
categories, particularly in patio. So, as time moves on and weather stabilizes, we are seeing improvement in those
categories.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: From a geographical standpoint, we had negative comp performance in two regions, our
Boston or most Northeast region, primarily driven to the changes in weather from last year, we saw the biggest impact
there; and then in our St. Louis region, which we saw with the significant flooding events that took place during the

quarter. So, both those regions, as Mike said, as these – as the product categories have performed better, those regions
have also improved from a performance standpoint as well.
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: And this is Marshall. I'll just say that from March to April, we liked that trajectory. So,
thus far in May, we're pleased with what we're seeing.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay, great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks so much, and good morning. I want to dig a bit deeper into the promotional and
pricing actions. If you could just reiterate, were these focused in seasonal where you were seeing some of the
challenges? Were they focused in some historically promotional categories like appliances? And where else might you
have undertaken them? And were they pretty much directly connected to some of the changes in marketing? Or should
we think about these as two separate efforts?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Matt, this is Mike. I would tell you that some of the select pricing investments that we
made were really tied to seasonal products, and we executed those mid-quarter and certainly saw some improvement,
as I just mentioned. The other area of focus has been an investment in special order products, really across our digital
assortment, supporting our omni-channel to engage customers, both Pro and DIY, that they build out their projects and
leverage our extended line design through our digital properties. So, they're the areas of most significant focus in regard
to those investments.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: And just to think for a second about that seasonal business, you spoke about the weather
which clearly was an impediment. So, was this an effort to try to overcome that impact? Or were you simply saying,
hey, whatever it takes, whether – whether or not – or did you feel like there's more of a share issue in that category for
you?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: It was really designed with the market adjustments we made to try and capitalize on
seasonal traffic, recognizing that both in the first and the second quarter, seasonal traffic is a significant driver of the
traffic that engages with the portfolio. So that's why we did it, to really complement the marketing adjustments and
revert on the traffic.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: And to the extent that the full year gross margin outlook seems to be better than what you
showed in Q1, presumably a little bit less of a drag from RONA as you cycle the acquisition, but would you expect
some of those investments in pricing and promotions to subside?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Yeah. For the remainder of the year, Matt, we expect to partially offset the impact of
some of those promotions and pricing investments. We have cost improvements from our line review process as well as
refining that promotional strategy and eliminating the less effective promotions as the year unfolds, as well as
fine-tuning our pricing actions based on the results that we're seeing. As you know, we constantly adjust our approach
to optimize gross margin, making sure we deliver value to our customers, while balancing the traffic and ticket
equation. That process is managed daily and we do think we'll see improvement.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thank you so much.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Matt.

<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: Hey, good morning. Just to clarify a couple of those statements earlier. Could you
specify which categories were negative in the quarter? And then also any impact from Easter as you had estimated on
the monthly comps, March and April?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Yeah. I can talk to the categories of negative comp. They were the lawn and garden
category, and seasonal and outdoor living categories.
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: Yeah. On the Easter shift, Dennis, it was a negative 0.5% in March versus the 1.2% stated
earlier and then it was 3.2% on an adjusted basis for the Easter shift in April versus the 4% that I highlighted earlier.
<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: Okay. And then can you also clarify – when you talked about the Canadian pressure in
the quarter, I think that was on the core business, but more broadly can you just talk about what RONA is comping at
today just to give us a sense and what that would – how that is impacting the comp when it does come in?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Dennis, this is Robert. The comps, as you know, that we mentioned are for – I mentioned in
my comments are for the legacy Lowe's business that we have in Canada. The RONA business that we acquired, as
Marshall said, it won't roll into comps until late in the second quarter.
<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: Yeah. I understand it's not in the comp base, but can you give us a sense of what it is
comping at today?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Go ahead, Richard.
<A - Richard D. Maltsbarger>: So, this is Richard Maltsbarger. The current RONA business is comping at the
expectations that we had for Q1 with the exception very similar to what we're seeing in the U.S., to the pressures that
Robert mentioned in his remarks regarding the unseasonal late spring snowfall that we experienced especially across
Quebec.
<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: And those expectations were consistent with the domestic business or plus or minus?
<A - Richard D. Maltsbarger>: They're consistent with the domestic business.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, wanted to get your thoughts, I've been asking some
companies this. As you look at the business, do you think compares really matter from the same-store sales perspective
as you think about the cadence of the quarters for the year? In other words, at this point in cycle outside of the weather
variability that obviously shifts demand, is your comp trend a comp trend or do you look at the next two quarters and
think there were specific items that impacted the business last year that would suggest we should think more about
comp stacks versus the overall trend in the industry?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Well, certainly, Chris, when we look at comps, as we said, first quarter of this year, we were
going up against tougher compares from a year ago and that's why I think we had previously indicated on our fourth
quarter call that we expected the best comps in our second and third quarter of the year where we're going up against
our weakest compares.
So, if you take the combination of being up against the tougher compares, weather challenges, and how they hit in the
quarter, I was thinking you make a good point that you have to kind of look and bring all those factors to bear when
you look at the performance. As we said, overall, when we look at the business, in the first quarter, even with the
weather, we delivered sales that were just slightly below our plan and with the actions that Mike and his team were
taking, we think we have good line of sight to being able to recover that top line, as well as being able to continue to
mitigate some of the margin impact we had for the first quarter when we get past the anniversary of the RONA

acquisition and those things.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Understood. And then, two quick follow-ups. First on Maintenance Supply
Headquarters, have you included that in the outlook? I know it hasn't closed quite yet, but is that included in the
outlook? And if it's not, or either way, can you give us some understanding on how that might impact gross margin and
SG&A when it comes in? Will we see any impact at all? Is it just too small relative to the total?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Yeah. I would say one, it's still a pending acquisition, we haven't received final
regulatory approval for that. We did not bake that into our guidance.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: And so, once we get through the acquisition, then we would roll any impact that we see
from that into our guidance, first time we update after the acquisition.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Okay. But you mentioned that you do expect it will be accretive this year, any indication
on what it might be?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Yes. We do expect it to be slightly accretive this year.

Your final question will come from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on two things. One, housekeeping, what was inflation in the
comp? I think you mentioned the gross margin, but not the comp.
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: Yeah. We had about 50 basis points, again, primarily driven by lumber in the first quarter.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. And then it sounds like – I don't want to put words in your mouth, the comp trend through
the quarter, that 450-bp deceleration from February into March, and then coming back in April, but that change was
entirely traffic driven and the ticket was pretty steady. Is that a fair assumption?
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: Yes, it is.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. And then, finally, maybe just to help frame it a little bit as we think about flow-through the
rest of the year, credit profits remind us – that shows up entirely in SG&A, or does some of it show up in gross margin?
And could you remind us roughly how much of SG&A is a profit share from the credit card? Thanks.
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: Well, I will disclose that it does show up in SG&A. So, the whole program, income and
cost flow through below the margin line, but it is in our operating margin.
<Q - Greg Melich>: So the costs are in gross margin, but the...
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: No. No. No. No.
<Q - Greg Melich>: ...profits, or the lack thereof...
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: The entire program...
<Q - Greg Melich>: ...in the portfolio is SG&A?
