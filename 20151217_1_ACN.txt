Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We had a strong first quarter, and I'm very pleased with our
results and the continued momentum in our business. Our revenue growth was again broad-based across the different
dimension of our business, including double-digit local currency growth in three of our five operating groups, and in
North America and Europe, our two largest geographic regions. I'm particularly pleased with our results in
Digital-related services where we delivered very strong revenue growth of more than 20%.
Here are few highlights for the quarter. We delivered $7.7 billion in new bookings which were in line with our
expectations. We grew revenues 10% in local currency, gaining significant market share. We expanded operating
margin 20 basis points to 15.2%. We delivered earnings per share of $1.28 which includes a negative impact of $0.07
from a higher tax rate in the quarter.
We generated solid free cash flow of $517 million, and we returned approximately $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders
through share purchases and the payment of our semi-annual dividend. So we are off to a good start in fiscal year 2016,
and given our strong performance, we have raised our outlook for revenue growth for the full year.
Now, let me hand over to David. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre. Happy holidays to all of you, and thank you for taking the time to join us on today's call. Let me
start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, especially as it relates to our
strong and broad-based top line growth. Our differentiated growth strategy, which focuses on five businesses delivered
in an industry-relevant context, continues to resonate with the market and yield strong value for our clients and our
shareholders.
Before I get into the details, let me comment on a few of the highlights this quarter. Strong local currency growth of
10% represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth as we continue to outpace the market and take
share. The durability of our growth model is evident in our results with double-digit growth in three of the five
operating groups in both Europe and North America. Digital-related services continues to be the dominant growth
theme as we continue to be a market leader in the rotation to the new.
Operating margin of 15.2% reflects 20 basis points of expansion, consistent with our objective to expand margins while
investing significantly in our business and our people. Free cash flow came in as expected at just over $500 million,
and at the same time we returned roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And we
continue to invest at scale in our business, closing four acquisitions in the quarter with invested capital of over $600
million, which represents a great start towards our fiscal 2016 objective to invest as much as $900 million to $1 billion
to add scale and capabilities in key growth areas.
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $7.7 billion for the
quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.4 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $3.3 billion

with a book-to-bill of 0.9. This level of new bookings follows our typical pattern of lower new bookings in our first
quarter which then build throughout the year. It's important to note that this level of new bookings represents 9%
growth in local currency over last year's quarter one with a significant portion expected to convert to revenue in fiscal
2016.
The highlight of the quarter was strong Consulting bookings, which reflect 24% growth in local currency over last year,
fueled by demand for Digital-related services across Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and Application
Services. Looking forward, we're very pleased with the expansion in our pipeline and expect strong bookings in the
second quarter.
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8 billion, a 1.5% increase in USD, 10% in local currency,
reflecting a negative 8.5% FX impact consistent with the assumption we provided in September. Quarter one revenues
were roughly $60 million above the upper end of our guided range, primarily driven by stronger than expected
Consulting revenues. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 6% in USD, and 15% in local currency.
Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, down 4% in USD, and an increase of 5% in local currency.
Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter, Digital-related services grew over 20% in local currency
and fueled strong double-digit growth in Strategy, and Consulting and Services combined. Operations and Application
Services came in as expected with high single-digit growth and mid-single digit growth, respectively.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology grew 12%. The sixth consecutive
quarter of double-digit growth. Growth was broad-based and led by double-digit growth in North America and the
growth markets as well as Communications and Media and Entertainment globally. Financial Services' strong
momentum continued with 12% growth driven by very strong growth in Banking and Capital Markets and in both
Europe and the growth markets.
Products also delivered broad-based growth of 12%, led by our industrial and life sciences industries with continued
very strong overall growth in Europe and the growth markets. H&PS grew 8% in the quarter. We continue to be
pleased with the performance of our Health industry, which again delivered double-digit growth, and additionally
H&PS grew double digits overall in North America, including in both Health and the Public Sector.
And finally, Resources delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of 6% growth led by strong double-digit growth in
Utilities, as well as strong overall growth in North America and Europe. Revenue performance in the energy industry
and in the growth markets was challenged this quarter due to industry and country-specific cyclical headwinds.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32% compared with 32.2% in the same period
last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.9% compared with 11.5% for the first quarter last year,
down 60 basis points. General and administrative expense was 5.8% compared with 5.6% for the first quarter last year,
up 20 basis points. Operating income was $1.2 billion in the first quarter reflecting a 15.2% operating margin, up 20
basis points compared with quarter one last year.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.1% for the first quarter last
year. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations and other
adjustments to prior year taxes compared to the first quarter of last year. As you know, our quarterly tax rate can vary
and our view of our full year tax rate has not changed as you'll hear when I'll provide our business outlook in a few
minutes.
Net income was $869 million for the first quarter compared with net income of $892 million for the same quarter last
year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.28 compared with EPS of $1.29 in the first quarter last year. As I just
referenced, there was a $0.07 impact to EPS this quarter from the higher tax rate compared to the first quarter last year.
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continue to be industry-leading. There were 41 days compared to 37
days last quarter and in the first quarter of last year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $517 million resulting from
cash generated by operating activities of $611 million, net of property and equipment additions of $95 million.

Moving to our level of cash. Our cash balance at November 30 was $3.1 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August
31. The current levels reflect both the cash returned to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, and our
investments in acquisitions.
Turning to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global head count of 373,000 people, with
270,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. Utilization was 90% compared with last quarter, consistent with last
quarter. Attrition was 13%, down 1% from quarter four and consistent with the same period last year.
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed
6.5 million shares for $658 million at an average price of $100.53 per share. At November 30, we had approximately
$7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid the semi-annual cash dividend of $1.10
per share for a total of $721 million. This represented an $0.08 per share, or 8% increase over the dividend we paid in
May.
So, in summary, we are off to a very good start in fiscal 2016. Our top line results and our increased revenue outlook
for the year, which I'll cover shortly, reflect continued strong momentum in our business.
Now, let me turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David. Our strong results in the first quarter demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our
growth strategy. At our Investor & Analyst Conference in October, we provided an update on the actions we have taken
and investments we have made to position Accenture to Lead in the New which we define as Digital, Cloud, and
security-related services, all enabled by new and innovative technology. In the first quarter, we continue to rapidly
rotate our business to the New with Digital, Cloud and Security revenues combined already approaching 40% of our
total revenue. So the investments we are making in these areas are clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace
and driving significant growth.
Let me bring this to life with a few examples. Digital is all about enabling our clients to unleash the power of Digital
technologies to create new sources of value. We continue to see very strong demand in this area, and are leveraging our
digital capabilities with clients in nearly every industry around the world. We are working on a five-year Digital
transformation with a European aerospace company, bringing our capabilities in mobility, analytics, and the Internet of
Things to drive productivity improvements. We are helping a global pharma company, improving supply chain by
leveraging our advanced analytics capability, including the Accenture Insights Platform, ultimately giving patients and
doctors access to the diagnostics and medicine they need faster than ever.
Cloud is increasingly becoming a starting point for clients who want to create new services faster, and get access to
computing capabilities in a more cost effective way. We are working with a leading U.S. energy company to deliver a
new operating model underpinned by the Accenture Cloud Platform and our Hybrid Cloud Solution. With this new
As-a-Service model, the client can leverage our Cloud-based data analytics while benefited from a flexible
consumption-based pricing structure.
At Accenture, we have a Cloud First agenda to help clients move their businesses to the cloud quickly and easily. And
we continue to invest to build our capabilities. In September, we announced the acquisition of Cloud Sherpas, and in
October, we announced a new partnership with Amazon Web Services. The newly formed Amazon AWS business
group will offer integrated Consulting and Technology solutions to help clients take advantage of the flexibility of
another service model.
Turning to security, in the digital and connected world, security is increasingly important to our clients. We are now
leveraging FusionX, a cybersecurity business we acquired in Q4, in our work with a global high-tech company. We
identified gaps in the client's defenses by simulating a sophisticated cyberattack, and we are now working with them to
improve their security strategy. And of course, we continue to work with clients on large scale, mission-critical
transformation programs. We bring a full range of services in Strategy, Consulting, Digital Technology and Operations,

together with our industry expertise, to deliver tangible outcomes for clients.
As an example, we are working with a global apparel manufacturer on an enterprise-wide transformation to reduce
back office cost by 50% and position the company for growth. As a first step, we are enhancing the efficiency and
quality of the clients' finance and accounting processes across 26 countries while significantly reducing cost.
Turning now to the performance of our three geographic regions. In North America, I am very pleased that we again
delivered double-digit growth. The 11% increase in revenues was driven by strong double-digit growth in the United
States.
In Europe, we had another great quarter with 12% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in
many of our major markets, such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Switzerland, as well as high-single digit
growth in Germany.
And in growth markets, we delivered 6% growth in local currency, led by Japan, the largest country in our growth
markets. Japan has delivered eight quarters in a row of double-digit growth. At the same time, we are carefully
monitoring the situation in Australia and Brazil, which have been affected by commodity price volatility in the energy
and natural resources sectors.
Before I turn it back to David, let me comment on talent and leadership at Accenture. I am extremely pleased that we
just promoted a record 723 people to Managing Director and Senior Managing Director. And I'm particularly pleased
that 28% of our new promotes are women. These promotions reflect our commitment to career growth for people and
to developing the talented leaders we need to serve our clients and run Accenture as a world-class business.
So, with the first quarter behind us, I'm pleased with the continued momentum in our business. We are executing our
strategy very well, and our rotation to the new, combined with our unique ability to deliver end-to-end solutions to
clients, continues to drive strong demand.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues
to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $7.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 6% compared to the
second quarter of fiscal 2015, and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year
2016, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our
results in U.S. dollars will be negative 5% compared to fiscal 2015. For the full fiscal 2016, we now expect our net
revenue to be in the range of 6% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal 2015.
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year 2016 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 basis point to 30 basis point
expansion over adjusted fiscal 2015 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of
25% to 26%. For earnings per share, we continue to expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of
$5.09 to $5.24, or 6% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal 2015 results.
Turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal 2016, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1
billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million, and free cash flow to be in
the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. We continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share
repurchases, and now expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we
remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?

Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as
possible to ask a question. Greg, would you please provide instructions for those on the call?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Good morning. Solid results. Consulting was a little bit stronger obviously than I
thought, but outsourcing was a little softer, came in at I think it was 5% constant currency that was down from 9% in
the fourth quarter. Just trying to figure out any one-timers, or anything going on there in outsourcing and what the
outlook is going forward in outsourcing?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, there's certainly nothing unusual in terms of one-time events. I mean when you pull
outsourcing back, as a type of work, and then related to our business, our five businesses, a large part of Operations, a
significant portion of Operations is part of the Outsourcing type of work, and then the application maintenance piece of
Application Services is part of the Outsourcing type of work as well.
Within Operations, the core driver is BPO, and I'll say we continue to feel very good about our BPO business. The
growth rates have been such that we've continued to take significant share. And if you look at our Operations business
overall, our expectation for growth remains the same, no different from what I communicated at IA Day where we
think our Operations business will grow very well in the upper single to low double-digit range, and of course, BPO is
a key anchor to that.
If you look at the other component of outsourcing, which would be application maintenance within Application
Services, let me say that for Application Services we now see mid-single-digit growth as we've talked about, there's
kind of two component in Application Services. There is the maintenance of the existing kind of legacy applications for
our clients, which is an important function. And then on the other end of the spectrum, there's the investment in new
technology and the deployment of new technology.
So when you look at App Services, we see extremely strong growth in the project-based work in Application Services.
That work related to deploying and building new technology. That is reflected in our Consulting-type of work which is
why you see Consulting-type of work growth so strong. What we see is clients are looking to reduce their cost of
ownership of their existing applications, so therefore there's relatively less investment in the maintenance piece in lieu
of higher investments in the development piece.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. And then when we look at the full year now, the 6% to 9% constant currency guidance,
if you split that between Consulting and Outsourcing, what kind of growth rate should we see in both those segments?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, so for Consulting for the full year, I'm talking about Consulting type of work, to be
clear, we see low double digit growth. For outsourcing, we need to see mid-single digit growth. And then underneath
that, you got the components of Operations and the maintenance piece of App Services as I described.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And we are very pleased with that mix.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Thanks so much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you. Thanks, Bryan.

Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Hi. Great.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Tien-Tsin. How are you?
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Good morning. Similar question to Bryan's. I guess, just on the outsourcing side with the
book-to-bill below one. I heard the answer but, is there simply just a mix shift going on towards Consulting from both
your side as well as from the clients? And I'm curious if also you've been able to maybe have some tougher comps
because you've had some large $100-plus million deals earlier in the year, how is the pipeline on bookings as well? Did
you give the $100 million-plus number of contracts this quarter? Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I'll just mention quickly that we had six clients with bookings over $100 million. Let
me just mention a couple of data points and then let Pierre add some commentary as well. We feel very good about our
pipeline. And if you think about our pipeline and the type of work view, if you will, we feel good about our pipeline
pretty much across the board and we've seen good expansion in our pipeline. We see a lot of market activity at least
from our perspective, and good dialogue with our clients across both Consulting and Outsourcing. So, feel good about
our pipeline. Again, we expect that we'll see an uptick in bookings in the second quarter, and are very encouraged by
what we see.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, just to add on this and as well answer to Bryan, I feel extremely comfortable with where
we are with Outsourcing and Consulting business. The uptick on outsourcing is lower, because Consulting is doing
extremely well. And that is why we have the results we are. And it's all our ability indeed to take advantage of any
move or shift of the budget of our clients from indeed outsourcing type of work to Consulting investments. And this is
exactly the opportunity we are taking to grow. And if you look at our rotation to Digital, and to the New, the path of the
Consulting business in this rotation is more important than the outsourcing part of it. So it's explaining that Consulting
is back with a strong growth and we are pleased with the growth we have in outsourcing. So from my standpoint, I have
zero concern.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Makes sense. No, Consulting was very strong. Just a quick follow-up then, just the Navitaire
timing. I know I always ask about Navitaire, forgive me. But when should we expect that to come out of the P&L?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, we – yes. So, Tien-Tsin, we can't – I wouldn't run the risk of predicting the timing.
What I can say again is that the deal has already been approved in the U.S. and in Brazil. We have been in the process
of cooperating with the European Commission as they go through their review process, and it'll conclude when it
concludes.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Okay.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Timing is hard to predict.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Okay. So probably nothing explicit in the guidance?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. Right.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: All right. Thank you. Have a good, safe...
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, yeah.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Have a good, safe end of the year.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right. Thank you. Same to you.

<Q - David J. Koning>: Yeah. Hey guys. Nice job. And I guess, first of all, just acquisitions have ramped you've
talked about you how that might contribute I think 1.5% to 2% to revs. Is that largely in Consulting? Since half of revs
is Consulting is that maybe benefiting now by 4% from the acquisitions while outsourcing isn't benefiting from
acquisitions?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Answer is, yes, indeed our acquisitions are creating more impact in our revenue growth in
Consulting compared to Outsourcing. So it is another driver explaining the difference between both businesses.
<Q - David J. Koning>: And is that maybe – is maybe 90% of acquisitions, or maybe what's the mix between how
much of those acquisitions are benefiting Consulting relative to Outsourcing?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I would say, if you look currently in recent quarters, it's a very high percentage, and of
course, it reflects the market opportunity in a way our business is evolving. If you went back, let's say, a year, year and
a half ago, two years ago, they would've been more outsourcing-oriented. But it's a very high percentage, and you are
correct to identify that the overall inorganic contribution is in the 2% range, and you're correct to identify that the
majority of that is reflected in our Consulting type of work growth.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, but to be clear, the vast majority of our acquisitions are contributing to Consulting
business.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Great.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. And your 4% is in the right zone, to be clear.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up then, revenue per billable employee, that's been
declining a little bit. It's now probably in the mid-single-digit declines on a constant currency basis. So it's gotten a
little, I guess you could say, worse, but is that really just you significantly ramping hiring kind of in anticipation of
what has been and probably continues to be really good growth? Is that the right way to think of it, or maybe you could
just kind of outline what's happening there?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, certainly if you look at the last two quarters, that influences that metric which I'll look
out obviously as well. So if you look at it, let's say, in the recent two quarters, you have the impact that we have very
intentionally built, and key skill areas, key growth areas. And you have seen that our utilization, let's say, in quarter one
of this year compared to quarter one of last year was down about 1%, and that reflects that building of bench. And so
that does go into that calculation when you look at it all in as you do.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Okay. Great. Thanks. Nice job.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you. Appreciate it.

<A - David P. Rowland>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Hey, how are you?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Fine.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: So on the guidance raise for the year, the 1% increase, how much of that is from some of
the incremental acquisitions, because I know you did spend a bit there in Q1 versus how much is just kind of pure
organic?

<A - David P. Rowland>: It's really no change in the incremental acquisitions. We still see about 2% for the year. And
you may remember at, I guess it wasn't the earnings call, but I think it was IA Day I stated explicitly that the deals that
had signed, that we anticipated closing in the first quarter, which have ultimately closed, we had reflected that in our
initial guidance. So this is a – you could interpret this as an increase in our organic revenue outlook.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Okay. Good to hear. And just for a follow-up, I had a question on cash flow. I know it
can obviously be lumpy on a quarterly basis. And you did reiterate the full year outlook here. But Q1 at least relative to
our model was somewhat light. Maybe you can just remind us as far as timing of bonus payments, which quarter that
will fall, and is there anything in the cash flow performance this quarter that makes you feel any less confident,
reiterating the full year target, I mean I looked at unbilled, it seem like those grew a little faster than revenue in the
quarter; was that just timing or any other factors that might cause that dynamic to continue?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, so one of the factors was the increase in DSO in the first quarter. We had signaled I
think both at IA Day and probably the fourth quarter earnings call that our cash flow guidance allowed for the
possibility of an uptick in DSOs. That's what we've seen. On one hand, we're very happy with 41 days. On the other
hand, we always are working to do better. We have a very, cash is king, kind of culture, and so we did have an uptick.
That reflects in the first quarter results. And then the second factor that influences, there are actually three factors or
four factors, but the second one that I would call out would be the timing of tax cash payments. Those can ebb and flow
across the quarters of a year. And that was a factor in the first quarter this year, compared to the first quarter of last
year, doesn't change our expectation for the full year, it just means that we had a higher percentage of tax cash
payments in the first quarter this year relative to the first quarter last year. Those were really the two drivers of tax cash
payments and DSO.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Okay. I appreciate the color. And have a good holiday.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right. You too. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Mark Togut>: Thank you, and good morning.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning.
<Q - David Mark Togut>: The Digital-related services growth was very strong at 20% plus, but down from the 35%
you generated in FY 2015, which was an extraordinary result. Can you give us a little more color on why the
magnitude of the slowdown in growth? And in the new guidance you provided today what is your embedded
assumption about Digital-related services revenue growth?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. So I'm going to get the first part of the answer, and I'm delighted with the growth of our
Digital-related services, over 20%. This is exactly the zone where we expect our Digital-related services to grow. As
you said, fiscal of 2015 posted some extraordinary growth, and – beyond our expectations, if you will, and so we are
now planning our investments on the growth of Digital-related services to be in that category of growth, and we are
very pleased with that. It doesn't signal any form of slowdown. I mean, we are growing on back of big numbers. If you
remember last year, our Digital-related services, they do represent $7 billion, what we're calling Digital, and this is
where we measure our Digital rotation. So growing double-digit on back of that base is what I would qualify a tour de
force.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, and David, this is – just to add – this is entirely consistent with what we expected and
signaled. We see the outlook for Digital for the year and continued strong double-digit growth. I think we mentioned
again at IA Day that, while we were incredibly pleased with the growth in 2015, it was much higher than we would've
expected, and it's higher than it would be prudent to assume as we plan our year. Having said that, one of the things
about our model is the flexibility and our know-how to ramp up resources as we need to if the growth opportunity

presents itself even stronger than we expected. So we'll see how it plays out, but if we have Digital growth above 20%,
we are doing a heck of a job executing our strategy.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Especially as the vast majority of this growth is organic.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah.
<Q - David Mark Togut>: Understood. As a quick follow-up, are you able to get differential pricing for
Digital-related services from your clients?
<A - David P. Rowland>: We do see some differentiated – well, first of all, it's hard to talk about – in that context, it's
hard to talk about Digital overall because, as you know, we have Digital work that we do in Accenture Strategy,
Accenture Consulting, Accenture Technology, meaning App Services, and Operations. I would say, as a general
statement, we have favorable economics in Digital and I can assure you, we are always pushing, whether it's Digital or
any other part of our business, where there is a high value service offering in the marketplace, and where we have
highly differentiated skills and capabilities, that plays in our favor from a pricing standpoint, and we try to get the yield
from that.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity. Please go ahead.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Hello, Rod.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Hi there, guys. Hey. So I just wanted to talk a little bit about where your partners are spending
their time, because I wonder if some of the variation in growth rates across your business are really a function of where
they're devoting their attention. Right now you've got your growth markets, which currently looks a little bit like a
misnomer, right? Your growth markets are growing at half the rate of the U.S. and Europe. And Consulting, even on an
organic basis, is growing a lot faster than outsourcing. Is that partly a function of where your partners are spending their
time in the pipeline, and it's really – it wouldn't be feasible for us to expect you to grow Outsourcing and Consulting
right, at this sort of double-digit pace, because your partners can only spend their time on certain things in one given
quarter?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I think I understand your question. Let me just start with the growth markets, as you
characterize it, as a misnomer. I think it is important to kind of peel that back and you'll understand that growth markets
is appropriate when I say this, is that we've talked about the cyclical challenges in energy and natural resources, which
is reflected in our Resources Operating Group results. I can tell you that if you look at the growth markets, absent the
Resources Operating Group, which are attributed to the cyclical challenges that we know and understand in energy and
natural resources, the rest of the Accenture business is growing double-digits in the growth markets. And so it's
important to peel that one layer back so that you can be exposed to the fact that we actually have a very vibrant
business in the growth markets.
I think I get the essence of your question, is that we have a fixed capacity of partners in the channel, and if they direct
their focus to our Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting and the development part of Application Services, is it
simply a function of, if our capacity is focused on one part of our spectrum of our five businesses, does that mean by
design that Outsourcing goes down? And I would say, not necessarily at all. I do think that there's a lot of activity in the
Consulting type of work, which is Strategy, Consulting and the development part of App Services, there's a lot of
market activity and a lot of demand, and I think that's what the growth reflects. It's not so much about partners spending
time on activity A versus activity B.

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: No, no, absolutely. We have clear and differentiated strategies for our three regions. We have
clear leaders in the three, with Julie Sweet in North America, Gianfranco Casati in Growth Markets, and Jo Deblaere in
Europe. They are executing their strategies so there is not a priori or some biased views on this. Indeed, in the growth
market, the explanation of the growth slowing down compared to prior quarters is all coming from this cyclical impact
of energy and natural resources, otherwise we are very pleased.
I mentioned Japan, part of our growth market, again, posting a double-digit growth for, I think, eight quarters now in a
row, which is, frankly, a fabulous result. And we are taking opportunities in each and every market, as per our strategy
in Outsourcing and in Consulting. I think we did comment, the difference between Outsourcing and Consulting
momentum, because of the Digital-related services nature of the business, which is more around Consulting than
Outsourcing, which is just a demonstration that the budget from our clients are a bit moving from this outsourcing type
of business to the Consulting type of business. And as you see, in Europe with 12% growth we are definitely putting
our act together to create our own growth, almost against the economic condition of the markets.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, and I want to say again so it doesn't get lost that Operations, and BPO within
Operations, we're very pleased with that growth, very good growth and growing above the market taking share. That is
a very vibrant business for us.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: All right. Great. And then the follow-up is, especially given that your demand today is very
weighted towards Consulting, do you expect any budget uncertainties as we move into early calendar 2015? And has
your guidance accounted for the potential that the year gets off to a slow start as we've seen sometimes in other years,
particularly when demand is coming from Consulting, the early calendar year budget can be somewhat of an
uncertainty? And I just wonder to what extent that's accounted for in the guidance?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, we have – of course, our range, Rod, is three points to cover scenarios like that on the
downside. So we've accounted for it to the extent we have a three-point range. And we don't have any evidence of any
notable change in client budgets to the worse, which is your question, we don't have evidence of that through our
channels.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Great.
<A - David P. Rowland>: And again, our pipeline looks very good, which is indicative of the level of client
discussions that are underway currently.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Excellent. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Edward Schneider>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Relative to the Financials vertical,
wondering if you could talk a little about what you're seeing there which seems to be stronger than almost of all of your
peers some of which team to be talking about a little bit of a down tick in the business. Could you maybe talk about
specific elements or sub-areas where you're seeing strength there, and then particularly as we head into 2016 with rate
hikes, whether you think your clients are messaging a little bit even more optimistic spending expectations next year
than this year?

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Okay. So commenting on FS, we continue to be pleased with the results. I mean obviously,
again, double-digit growth in Financial Services. This is an industry if you look all together which is one of the largest,
I think we mentioned at the IA Day that if you put together Capital Markets and Banking would be one of the largest, if
not the largest industry at Accenture and of course this is an industry historically and currently investing in technology
and in transformation. So we continue to be very pleased with the opportunities offered by Financial Services. They
have to transform, and of course, Digital-related services are extremely relevant in Financial Services almost by
definition. It's a B2C, and it's enabling a lot Digital native technologies to maximize connectivity with the clients as
well as digitalizing their operations.
This is an industry where historically we made the right investments, and think about the investments we made in
insurance, where we are extremely well-positioned with our Software Solutions, and think about the investment we
made in Credit Services where we are now building a leading independent mortgage processor in the U.S. and very
pleased with the momentum we're getting in Brazil where we are expanding our services in Credit Services to again
[indiscernible] (45:09) position. We just announced this quarter a very niche, and very good acquisition in Boston on
asset management, called Beacon, and very pleased with that adding super deep expertise.
So overall, we are very pleased with what we are doing in FS, which is quite broad-based across the different regions as
well. If you look at North America, if you look at, especially Europe, where we're doing very well, excellent result in
growth markets. So this is the industry where I'm coming from, and this is the one I love the most.
<Q - James Edward Schneider>: That's helpful. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, to earlier question on head count,
billable head count increased I think the fastest growth rate we've seen in quite a few years. Could you maybe first talk
about how much of that is driven by the M&A that closed? And then specifically within this, any specific areas outside
of Digital where you're seeing a lot of uptick in the head count growth? And I guess, more broadly speaking, I assume
it says something pretty positive about the outlook you see for the business over next few quarters?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I mean in the context of the overall Accenture organization, the acquired head count
is just not that – it's an important skills that we're acquiring, but in the context of the overall head count, to your
question, it's just not that material. I mean, we see growth in head count really across our business including by the way
in our GDN, you'll see in the statistics that a high percentage of the head count is in our Global Delivery Network. And
again, I think the theme that underpins it, whether you're talking about Strategy, Consulting, Application Services, or
our Operations, the common theme is this Digital rotation and the services and the type of work we're doing in that
regard really is a driver of the skills we're acquiring, as a general theme.

Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Friedman>: Hi. David, in your prepared remarks you had called out the timing of bookings to rev rec. I
was wondering, are there any either operating groups or business dimensions where the revenue recognition is faster
than others?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, I would say as a general rule, if you look at Accenture Strategy, Accenture
Consulting, and the project-based work in Application Services, which is the deployment of new tech, and let's just say,
packaged software even more broadly, the turn to revenue is, in all of those cases is faster than let's say the rest of the
business that I didn't call out. And those are structural differences. So when you see such strong growth rates in our
Consulting type of work business, that just reflects bookings that convert to revenue faster than, let's say, certainly the
typical Operations contract would, or an application maintenance contract would.

<Q - James Friedman>: Got it. Just writing it down. And then I had a housekeeping question as a response to one of
your prior answers. I want to make sure I heard this right, you were mapping the two sides of Application Services
between application maintenance, and what I think you would describe as application modernization. Did I hear that
right that part of it goes towards Outsourcing and part of it goes towards Consulting in terms of the disclosures?
<A - David P. Rowland>: That is correct. So Application Services has what we've traditionally called application
outsourcing, or application maintenance work. That maps to our outsourcing type of work. The rest of Application
Services which is really about fundamentally development work, application development work, whether it be new tech
or could be development around existing legacy applications, packaged software, deployment, et cetera, that is what we
would've historically referred to as systems integration, and that maps to the Consulting type of work.
<Q - James Friedman>: Thanks. That's helpful.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you. Appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Hi. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on just as Digital is becoming a
bigger part of your business, what the margin profile is for the Digital work that you're doing? And is it fair to
categorize its bookings realization as a faster rate than the rest of the business?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, we're not going to comment specific, I mean, not in specific terms on margin for each
dimension. I think we've said before that the nature of Digital, just as a general statement, it tends to be in high demand.
We have unique and differentiated skills and capabilities and arguably position in the marketplace. And all of those
things lend itself to better economics. It's our job to deliver on that, but it certainly creates the right environment for
better economics. Your last question was – the other part of the question was, so Digital economics?
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Yes. It was on the bookings. Is it a faster realization rate on the bookings?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, there is to the extent that a high percentage of our Digital bookings are Consulting,
and Consulting has a higher velocity.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Okay. And then Just as a follow-up, we've heard some commentary in the market of maybe
some pricing issues within outsourcing. Has that increased or changed at all as the pricing – I know it's always difficult
in some of the maintenance stuff, but I'm just wondering if you've seen any changes in the market.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Specifically, I think you're referring to the application maintenance, application outsourcing
piece of Application Services. What I would say is that there is no doubt that that continues to be a highly competitive
market. When we comment on pricing, we comment on pricing in terms of the profit percentage on work that we sell.
And in that part of our business we see stable pricing.

<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: I was hoping to get a little bit more color around your shift to the new operating units. It's been, I
guess, 15 months or 18 months now that you started this transition to Strategy, Consulting, Operations and Technology
with Digital as an overlay. How deeply is that [ph] plumbed (52:21) in the organization I guess either now or you're
planning to? Meaning, are these truly distinct business units at this point as labor-fungible across them, or do the staff
sort of reside within a business unit and do they have different investment profiles, pricing models? Can you just give a
little bit more color around that?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, absolutely. Happy to comment on this, because I truly believe that we are proposing to
the marketplace and organizing Accenture in a very unique and differentiated way, and I tend to believe that none of
our competitors yet could match the capabilities and the organization we are putting in place. First, indeed we have
created five, Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture
Operations, all at scale, all with highly differentiated skills, a very different positioning compared to the competitive
environment, different economics. And to your question, indeed they are run as a business with the objective of being
top-class in their own categories.
But, of course, where we differentiate in the marketplace is our unique ability to combine our services to deliver what
we are calling the end-to-end services, because we truly believe that more and more clients are buying an outcome
more than an effort. And if you want to deliver an outcome, you need to contribute and participate to the design and
planning typically done by Accenture Strategy and Accenture Consulting, the high-value services and consultants, if
you will, then you move in to building solution with absolutely leading and cutting-edge solutions, exactly the job of
Accenture Digital, for digital-native solutions, and Accenture Technology for the leading platform solution or
application packages.
And when you have been building solution, you move into Accenture Operations, the part of Accenture where we
could operate on behalf of the clients either their business process, their cloud operation, or their security operation.
This depth and breadth and kind of operating model is absolutely unique in the marketplace, and is a great source of
differentiation for Accenture.
And on top of that, indeed, Lisa, we're putting our rotation to the new. Each of the five have a clear mandate to rotate
their business to new type of services where Accenture Strategy's going to be cutting-edge in developing digital
technologies and creating new business model for clients. Accenture Technology will now [ph] embed (55:08) very
innovative ways of doing development, what we're calling liquid, intelligent and connected. Accenture Operations will
be extraordinary analytics, rich in the way we are developing Operations, and in Security, with the acquisition of
FusionX, we are absolutely top of the game in term of simulating a cyber attack. So all these architecture we're putting
in place, and I say that with a lot of passion and energy during that call, is indeed unique in the marketplace, Lisa.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah Lisa, let me just add to what Pierre said and address another part of your question. A
key component of what Pierre just said is that our talent strategy is aligned with our five businesses. And so we have
talent that is managed, nurtured, developed, specific to Accenture Strategy. Those people tend to work essentially
exclusively on Accenture Strategy work. We have people that are identified as Accenture Consulting, developed,
nurtured, et cetera. Those people tend to work for the most part exclusively on Consulting work. By the way, that
includes our client account leads, people who are predominantly deployed to our operating groups that really not only
deliver Consulting services, but are also the integrator of Accenture capabilities to serve the client's need. You have
operations, where again, we have a talent model for Operations, Mike Salvino and Debbie Polishook manage that
workforce. They for the most part work exclusively in Operations.
And then you have Accenture Technology. And Accenture Technology is a little bit different, in that they have a
unique talent model, but yet some of those technology people support the development type work, the new tech, some
of those people may actually even be part of Consulting project delivery. We also have some of those people that at
points in time may be part of our Operations project delivery. So they work a little bit more across the organization, but
beyond Technology, we also have the innovation labs and things like that. But excluding Technology, the other
businesses are very specific and fit for purpose, in terms of the talent model and the types of projects those people work
on for our clients.

<A - David P. Rowland>: All right.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: As a follow-up, as you're in discussions with your major clients about their budgets for 2016, can
you characterize the magnitude of the shift in their budgets from the old to the new, like is this 5%, 20%, 1%?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I can't characterize. I can characterize only the trend is clear, that you see a shift from
investments in the legacy, if you will, to investment of the new. I tend to believe that the shift is increasing, and as
reflected in our growth in Digital-related services. Now, I do not have any market data that would characterize the
percentage of the shift. It's there. It's getting bigger, and indeed we could take advantage of this shift in term of budget,
as reflected with our 20%-plus growth in Digital-related services.

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: On balance, yes.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, guys.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you, Lisa.
<A - KC McClure>: Greg, we have time for one more question. Then Pierre will wrap up the call.
Operator
Okay. That question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Hi. Many thanks. David, I wanted to go to one area that you mentioned, is the growth
of your global GDN. Over the last seven quarters, it's been pretty steady in terms of increasing as a percent of total
head count by almost a point a quarter, and it's now just hovering below 73%. Is there a point at which you need to
have local presence, such that it's an impediment to the total number? In other words, how high can the global GDN go
as a percent of your total head count, because I would think that's been a significant contributor to the strong margin
performance you've had over the last couple of years?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, so, first of all, we still have room to expand our GDN head count in our model, and
certainly we don't see that we've reached a destination and we wouldn't go any further. Having said that, one of the
things that highly differentiates Accenture is our deep industry expertise and our client account teams that are at the
client site each and every day working shoulder-to-shoulder with our clients. And so, the thing about our model is that
we have a very strong presence in each of the geographic markets around the world where we operate. That's a vital
part of what is distinctive about Accenture, and then we extend that and complement that with arguably the best
technology Global Delivery Network in the world. To your question, we have the opportunity to take that further, and
we'll see how the market evolves, and then we'll respond accordingly.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Okay.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: And then maybe I'll just quickly submit my follow-up if I could. The free cash flow
guidance for the year, not the quarter, but the year, is a little slower than certainly the growth of net income or the EPS
context. And I was just wondering if you could call out some of the puts and takes there. I assume that the days cycle I
think is a headwind, in addition it looks like CapEx is a little bit, but could you also address how currency might be
impacting the growth of cash flow for the year? And that's it for me. Thanks very much everybody.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Great. I'll just say, I can't really do justice to the question, so I'll just share a couple quick
points. First of all, the free cash flow guidance is still above 1.0 in terms of free cash flow to net income, so very

healthy level of free cash flow. I mean a couple of things that influence it, one is the DSOs the other is timing of tax
cash payments, not only impacts a particular quarter, but can be different fiscal year to fiscal year. And the third is
CapEx, just to name those three, because you called them out, and we do anticipate a higher level of capital spending
this year as compared to last year. So that's in the mix as well.
Pierre Nanterme
Okay. Certainly time now to wrap up, and I want to thank you again for joining us today. With our first quarter behind
us, clearly we have created strong momentum in our business, especially with the investments we made in Digital,
Cloud and Security Services, which we are now calling at Accenture, the New. And that makes me really confident in
our ability to continue to successfully grow business and gain market share.
I want to take this opportunity to wish all of you, our investors and analysts and our Accenture people who are
hopefully listening to the call, a very happy holiday season and all the best for the New Year. We look forward to
talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call KC. All the best
to all of you, and the best for the New Year.
