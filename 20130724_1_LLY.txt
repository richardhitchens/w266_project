MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q2 earnings call 2013. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the conference over to Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Philip L. Johnson
Good morning and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's Second Quarter 2013 earnings conference call.
I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are John Lechleiter, our Chairman, President
and CEO; Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of our Lilly Research Laboratories;
Enrique Conterno, President of our Diabetes Business as well as Ilissa Rassner and Travis Coy from the Investor
Relations team.
During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current
expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide 3 and
those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information
provided about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be
promotional and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.

We're very pleased with the solid financial results we delivered in the second quarter of 2013. Strong performance of
key products and ongoing cost-containment efforts have allowed us to raise our full year financial guidance and
continue to place us on track to meet or exceed our financial minimum goals through 2014.
Let me begin today's call with a review of key events that have taken place since our last earnings call. In clinical news
I'll start by reviewing some of the highlights from recent medical conferences.
At the American Diabetes Association scientific sessions we presented detailed data from initial Phase III trials for both
dulaglutide and, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, for empagliflozin.
Along with Incyte at the European League against Rheumatism's annual European Congress of Rheumatology, we
presented 52-week efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2b trial of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
And at the meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology we announced that the PRONOUNCE study
comparing an Alimta carboplatin doublet regimen to a paclitaxel carboplatin bevacizumab triplet regimen did not
achieve its primary endpoint of improved progression free survival without grade 4 adverse events.
In other clinical news we announced that the Phase III trial for enzastaurin did not meet its primary endpoint for
disease-free survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are at high risk for relapse. And we stopped
the Phase II study for our BACE inhibitor being investigated as a once-daily treatment to slow the progression of
Alzheimer's disease.
On the regulatory front, the marketing authorization application for our new insulin glargine product was accepted for
review by the European Medicines Agency. And we received approval in the EU for Strattera for the treatment of
adults with ADHD. Strattera is the first product indicated for adults with ADHD across the EU region.
And from a commercial perspective, we were disappointed with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's draft
decision that proposed Coverage with Evidence Development for the use of beta-amyloid positron emission
tomography imaging agents, which includes our approved product, Amyvid. We believe that insufficient Medicare
coverage would be a significant setback for patients in the Alzheimer's disease community.
Now let's turn to our financial performance. First I'll provide some brief comments about our GAAP results and then
discuss a few non-GAAP measures which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business.
As you can see on slide 6, worldwide revenue increased 6% as growth in key products, including Cymbalta, Cialis,
Tradjenta, Animal Health, Axiron, Effient, insulins and Forteo, more than offset lower Zyprexa revenue following
patent expirations and for exenatide revenue following the transition of commercial rights to Amylin. Excluding
Zyprexa outside of Japan and exenatide, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 8.5%.
Gross margin percent of revenue increased 80 basis points from 79.5% to 80.3%. The increase in gross margin percent
was driven by higher prices and production volumes, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on
international inventory sold. Excluding the FX effect on international inventory sold from both 2012 and 2013, gross
margin percent of revenue increased 2 percentage points from 77.9% in Q2 of 2012 to 79.9% in Q2 of 2013.
As in past quarters, we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last ten quarters
with and without this FX effect.
Now let's move on to the non-GAAP measures provided on slide 7. This quarter's total operating expense, defined as
R&D and SG&A, declined 2%. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses fell 3%
while R&D expenses grew 1%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses reflects our ongoing
cost containment efforts, which were partially offset by higher litigation costs.
Other income and deductions provided income of $11.9 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared to an expense
of $16.5 million in the second quarter of 2012. This difference is primarily due to a gain on the sale of the Lilly Asia
Ventures investment.

Our tax rate was 20.5% this quarter, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points from Q2 2012. The decrease in the effective
tax rate reflects the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. that went into effect in January of 2013.
At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS increased a robust 40% to $1.16. Slide 8 provides the same information on a
year-to-date basis, while slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details
about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now I'll turn the call over to Ilissa.
Ilissa Rassner
Thanks, Phil. As you can see on slide 10, the total revenue increase of 6% for the quarter was driven by a favorable
price impact of 6% and a 2% increase in volume, partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 2%. By
geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma sales increased by 14% driven by price as volume was essentially flat. In
Europe, the volume decline of 4% was due to the Zyprexa patent expiration and the exenatide commercial rights
outside of the U.S. to Amylin Pharmaceuticals. Excluding Zyprexa and exenatide from both 2012 and 2013, volume for
the rest of our European products was up almost 3%.
Turning to Japan, our revenues were once again significantly impacted by the weakening of the yen. The 18% decline
from foreign exchange and 3% price decline were partially offset by strong double-digit volume growth of 10%.
Volume growth was primarily driven Forteo, Strattera, Tradjenta and Evista.
As for emerging markets, which is embedded in Rest of World, revenue grew 5% this quarter or 7% excluding the
impact of foreign exchange. Within emerging markets, China continued to register double digit revenue growth, up
18% driven by volume growth of 17%.
Elanco Animal Health sales grew 6% this quarter. In the U.S., sales grew 5% due primarily to increased demand of
Trifexis. Outside the U.S., sales increased 7% also driven by increased sales of companion animal products. We
continue to expect that Elanco will deliver robust growth for 2013 and in the coming years.
Finally, the 17% increase in Collaboration and Other revenue is due to Tradjenta growth.
Slide 11 illustrates the effective changes in foreign exchange on our 2013 results. At the bottom line, changes in foreign
exchange rates reduced our EPS growth by 12 percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew 8% while costs of sales
and operating expenses either decreased or grew slower than revenue leading to Q2 reported and non-GAAP EPS
growth of 46% and 52% respectively.
Next, I'll provide a brief pipeline update before turning the call over to Derica. Slide 12 shows our pipeline as of July
15. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing
attrition. As Phil mentioned earlier, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced that our new insulin
glargine product was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. We filed the applications to the EMA's
biosimilar pathway and are excited by the potential to offer a basal insulin to the treatment of patients with type 1 and
type 2 diabetes.
We also announced plans to stop development of enzastaurin which was being studied as monotherapy in the
prevention of relapse in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
With respect to earlier stages of the pipeline you'll see that we began Phase II testing of two small molecules, one for
osteoarthritis pain and one for cancer and one biologic, a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody for cardiovascular disease. We
also began Phase I testing for three biologics: two for diabetes, and one for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we
terminated development of a Phase II diabetes molecule.
We continue to expect four submissions this year. In addition to already filing empagliflozin and our new insulin
glargine product, both in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we remain on track to complete the already initiated
rolling submission for ramucirumab as a single agent biologic therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer

following progression on prior chemotherapy. As well as the U.S. and European submissions for dulaglutide, our
GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We are encouraged by our progress and believe this
pipeline positions us for growth post-2014.
Now I'll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the remaining key events for 2013, our financial guidance and
some closing comments before we open the call for Q&A. Derica?
Derica W. Rice
Thanks, Ilissa. I'll begin my remarks with slide 13. 2013 is an important year for Lilly. As you can see from the check
marks on this slide, we're making progress on our goals. Let me give you a quick reminder of the potential key events
for the remainder of this year as we continue to advance our pipeline and share clinical data that will help you better
gauge our growth potential post-2014.
In oncology, later this year we hope to present detailed data from the Phase III trial of ramucirumab in first-line breast
cancer. Now recall that the data we expect to receive in 2013 will be the final progression-free survival data and the
interim overall survival data.
There are also several Phase III trials that we expect to product data in 2013 although presentation of detailed data at
medical meetings would likely occur in 2014 or later. These include the initial Phase III trials of our novel of basal
insulin analog for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the pivotal trials for our new insulin glargine product, ramucirumab
as combination therapy for second-line gastric cancer, our Phase III trial for necitumumab in combination with
gemcitabine and cisplatin for first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer and the initial trials of edivoxitene as
adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder.
As Ilissa mentioned earlier, in addition to the two Phase III assets, empagliflozin and the new insulin glargine product
already submitted to regulatory authorities this year, we expect to have two more regulatory submissions: dulaglutide,
our once-weekly GLP-1 agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and ramucirumab as a single agent biologic therapy
in patients with advanced gastric cancer following progression on prior chemotherapy for which we've already
submitted two of the three molecules as part of the rolling submission.
In addition, in August we'll have the U.S. District Court trial for the Alimta method-of-use patent.
In Q3 we'll initiate Phase III, or excuse me, initiate EXPEDITION 3, a pivotal trial for solanezumab in patients with
mild Alzheimer's disease. During a recent investor call, we reviewed the details of this trial design.
And in December we'll lose U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta.
Now turning to our 2013 guidance, our solid financial performance has allowed us to raise our full year expectations. In
terms of the individual line items, we still project revenue to be between $22.6 billion and $23.4 billion.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue is now projected to be approximately 79%. As a result of our continued
cost-containment efforts, we've narrowed and lowered the forecast for marketing, selling and administrative expenses
to now be between $7 billion and $7.2 billion. We have also lowered the high end of the range of R&D expenses by
$100 million, which is now forecasted to be between $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion.
OID continues to be in the range of a net deduction of $50 million to a net income of $100 million. The tax rate is still
expected to be approximately 19%.
Driven primarily by strong gross margin performance as well as by lower total operating expenses, our non-GAAP EPS
is now expected to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.15 per share.
Finally, we still expect capital expenditures to be roughly $900 million.
Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from
these numbers to our 2013 guidance.

In closing, we are pleased with our financial performance this quarter. We delivered solid financial results including
top-line revenue growth and continued cost containment efforts which resulted in strong earnings growth. We remain
committed to our innovation strategy and we believe it will drive growth and expand margins post-2014.
We will diligently execute our strategy by continuing to replenish and advance our pipeline, continuing to drive growth
in our on-patent brands and in Elanco, Japan and emerging markets and continuing to drive productivity gains across
all areas of our business as demonstrated by our year-to-date financial performance. And of course, we are now
preparing to launch a number of new medicines.
The progress we've made positions us to meet or exceed our mid-term financial projections through 2014: minimum
annual revenue of at least $20 billion, net income of at least $3 billion and operating cash flow of at least $4 billion. We
continue to disseminate important data that will help investors and analysts better gauge our long-term growth
potential, with more to come over the remainder of 2013 and 2014 and we'll keep you updated on our continued
progress.
We're confident in our strategy and in our ability to successful navigate our patent expirations and to emerge with even
greater strength and capacity to drive growth. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we'll take your questions.
Operator, first caller, please.
Operator
Thank you, our first caller is Tom (sic) [Tony] Butler with Barclays Capital. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Yes. Thanks very much. First of all, welcome back, John. And two questions really for Dr.
Lundberg if possible.
One is, could you discuss your filing strategy for the insulin glargine in the U.S. and have you chosen a route that
includes a BOA.
And then second, there has been some commentary clearly out of ASCO and even before around VEGF inhibitors and
their ability to demonstrated good PFS but very little OS. You've seen this in glioblastoma just to point to one example.
And while I recognize ramu [ramucirumab] is a VEGF2, can you mechanistically help us understand the difference and
why PFS and OS may correlate this time or in fact may not? Thanks very much.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Tony, thank you for the questions. Since we do have Enrique here, who heads up our
diabetes business, we'll have him take the first question filing strategy for insulin glargine here in the U.S., our insulin
glargine product, I should say, in the U.S. and then Jan if you will do the honors on answering the VEGF question.
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. Tony, we are not discussing our regulatory strategy for our insulin glargine
product. As you are aware, we have filed in Europe and this has been filed through the EMA's biosimilar pathway.
That's what we can share at this time.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: Yeah. In relation to VEGFR inhibitors and ramu more specifically, we did see a
correlation for ramu between PFS and overall survival in the monotherapy for second-line gastric cancer and now we
need to wait and to see if we can repeat that for the other indications.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Kathy, next caller, please.

Thank you. That will be Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you. A quick few. First for Enrique, I think the uptake of Invokana in the U.S. has been
pretty robust as well as dapa [dapagliflozin] in certain European countries. Has your outlook changed in terms of peak
sales potential for empa [empagliflozin]?
And then for Jan, it looked like your CDK 4/6 inhibitor has interesting activity per the data at ASCO but also high rates
of diarrhea. Could you provide some context around that and next steps?
And, Derica, a few quarters ago you commented that 2014 EPS consensus was too low. Do you have any updated
commentary on that given that you set that precedent by commenting then? Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: All right, great. Gregg, thanks for the questions. Enrique, do you want to start us off?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. So we don't comment on competitive products but what I can say is as we look at
the uptake of these new classes, I think it's early, but so far it is encouraging in terms of what we see in terms of
adoption by physicians of these products that have been launched both in the U.S. and Europe.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: In relation to our CDK 4/6 inhibitor, we are very encouraged by the initial data we
have seen and now we are doing a variety of tumor expansions. One advantage of our compound could be that actually
it has a safety profile that enables continuous dosing without interruption which the other competitive compounds don't
seem to be able to do. So even if there may be some side effects, I think we need to see this in comparison to the other
agents in the same class.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, thanks, Jan. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Gregg, in January when I made that comment, this is when we were able to -- as we look at the
analyst estimates they were well below our $3 billion guidance that we had put out here as the minimums that we
thought we could achieve through this period. Now it's moved up somewhat but we are absolutely still committed as I
even sit here today that we have to believe we can exceed those minimums that we put out here. So if you look at our
performance here through the first half of 2013 we actually believe we are on track to at least meet or exceed those
goals.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks so much.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Kathy, if we can have the next caller, please.
Operator
Certainly. We have Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. I have a couple of questions. On slide 13 you talk about potential
regulatory submissions in 2013. Shouldn't ramucirumab for breast cancer potentially be on there assuming that the data
ends up being positive?
And then the second question on Alimta, the trial date for the patent challenge is drawing closer, can you comment on
whether settlement with your generic challengers remains a realistic possibility because usually these sorts of things get
hammered out ahead of a trial start date?
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Tim, thanks for the questions. In terms of the ramucirumab breast cancer, it would be
very difficult to go ahead and have a filing package ready for submission this year. Clearly if we have positive data, the
team will be very focused on moving as quickly as possible but would not want to set the expectation that would lead to
a filing in 2013 at this point.

And then for the litigation that's ongoing, as we've commented in the past, we do not have a history of settlements with
companies. You can observe that from past expirations that we have had of products. We've not commented
specifically on our strategy other than to say that we believe we've got valid intellectual property that we intend to
pursue to uphold. So we'll keep you posted as that trial progresses obviously through August. It starts here in
Indianapolis on August 19.
So thanks for the question, Tim. If we can go to the next caller, Kathy.
Operator
Thank you. We have Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thank you for taking my question. First of all, I'd just like to say it's great to see John
back in the saddle. Congratulations on a speedy recovery. We're all happy to have you back.
And my questions are, number one, since we have Enrique on the phone, Enrique, could you maybe bring us up to
speed in as much detail as you're willing to, at least, on the DPP-4 situation? There's been a lot of at least Wall Street
chatter about big discounting going on driven by Lilly. Can you update us on that and also maybe a broader overview
of what you're seeing in the DPP-4 market right now in terms of share for your own drug and collaboration with BI
[Boehringer Ingelheim] as well as overall rates of market growth, whether or not that has changed in the last few
quarters?
Number two, I think it's been Lilly's position – and please, correct me if I'm wrong, which is why I'm asking the
question – for ram [ramucirumab] in breast, it's been your position that an overall survival benefit is not needed for
FDA approval assuming the PFS benefit is clinically meaningful. I'd like to just get your thoughts on that, make sure
I'm not wrong.
And more of a general question as my third; at this point, now that we're closing in on Obamacare implementation, do
you expect any material impact to your business in 2014? I know you're not providing 2014 guidance specifically, but
just in general conceptually, any shifts there? Thank you very much.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Mark, thanks for the questions. Enrique, if you'll start off and I'll take the ram breast
cancer and we'll have John talk about the healthcare reform as we move forward into 2014 additional implementation
and some of the aspects of that law.
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. So on the DPP-4 market, we have seen a slowdown when we look at this market. I
think it is important to look at the history and when we look at what was driving some of that growth, it was coming at
the expense of both TZDs and to a lesser extent, SUs. Now the TZD opportunity is really drying out, so we basically
see these have some – are changing the dynamics of why the DPP-4 markets have slowed down in the U.S. We still see
a fairly good growth outside of the U.S.
When it comes to our share, I think we are pretty pleased in terms of our performance. We are gaining shares on a
consistent basis in most markets including the U.S. and Japan. Notably we got the add-on indication in Japan earlier
this year which has made us much more competitive in that market and we have seen significant uptake as a result of
that. We are pleased with our share performance everywhere we look.
When it comes to rebates, I think it's important to note that as we look at Tradjenta, specifically in the U.S., our tier 2
access in commercial is 65%. So that's not a level of access that I would classify as trying to really compete on pricing.
When we look at our composite access, it's below that of, when we look at both commercial and Plan D, still below that
of some of the leaders in this class. So we are gaining share despite the fact that we still have opportunities for
increased access to the tier 2 level.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Yeah. One quick comment in terms of share. I know some of you, Mark, and others on the
sell side do follow not only total prescriptions and new prescriptions but also new to brand. I think you'll see that
during this year we've actually passed Onglyza on the new to brand share of market that may be a leading indicator of

where NRx and then TRx may head in the future. So as Enrique said, we're very pleased with the performance.
In terms of ramucirumab for breast cancer and what is necessary for filing, there are definitely differences among
regulatory bodies. In the European Union essentially the main driver will be the progression-free survival data, not
necessarily the overall survival data. In the U.S., as you're alluding to, it's a bit more of a holistic equation looking at
both the magnitude and significance of the PFS benefit and then what's being seen in terms of a trend for OS. I think
strictly speaking it doesn't necessarily need to have a large statistically significant OS benefit if other attributes of the
molecule are very strong like the progression-free survival benefit, the safety profile, et cetera.
So again, obviously the best-case scenario is you've got a stat sig [statistically significant] result on your overall
survival and it's not an issue, but clearly it doesn't seem to be a prerequisite. And we'll look rather overall features of
the molecules in terms of best filing strategy and indicate to you that you should look at the overall safety and efficacy
profile to try to gauge likelihood of approval and probably the commercial uptake as well.
John, you want to comment on the Affordable Care Act for 2014?
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: Sure, Mark. Thank you and thanks to Tony for your kind comments. I'm back. I'm very
happy to be back and I'm going full bore.
With respect to Obamacare, I think despite some of the recent changes and challenges that we all know about in terms
of implementing that, our outlook relative to 2014 has not changed based on from what we have been planning all
along. And I don't think right now the implementation of the law is going to have any material impact on our business
next year.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Kathy, next caller, please.
Operator
Thank you. That will be Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. And, John, I echo the sentiments already discussed on the call, but really great to have
you back and thank goodness everything turned out okay.
A question for you and a question for Derica. Derica, could you – I mean obviously you guys are doing a great job
executing on your goals to leverage SG&A. Can you give us a sense for how far you are in your overall restructuring
plans, where you are with U.S. restructuring and how much further you can go, and where that stands globally outside
the U.S.? Because year-on-year we will see about a $500 million decline in SG&A following about a $350 million
decline the year before. So obviously to hit the $3 billion number, we need to see continued aggressive cuts in SG&A.
And just wondering sort of big picture where you are in the magnitude of that change.
And then, John, if you could talk about BD [Business Development] activity, just curious to know what your appetite
is. We're starting to see BD picking up across the sector here and there. I'm just wondering, given what you face over
the next couple years, what your appetite is. Thanks very much.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Good morning, Jami. This is Derica. As you recall, in April we announced further steps in the
restructuring of our U.S. commercial operations where we essentially reduced the size of our U.S. sales force by about
30%. And we indicated at that time that the savings on a four-year annual rate should be somewhere between $200
million, $250 million. Now, that's now complete so some of that may show up in the second half of the year, but we'll
get the full year impact starting in 2014.
We will continue to look for opportunities to further refine and streamline our business operations. As you also saw
from our results, we got really good leverage at the gross margin line and some of that was price, but also some of it
was driven by the efficiency of our manufacturing operations. Our plants are running all out in terms of full absorption
as well as doing very good job of expense management.

When you think about 2014, also bear in mind that not just on the SG&A line but also in terms of the R&D line, we are
in the midst of completing some very large and expensive trials. So as those roll off between 2013 and 2014, that gives
us some relief on our R&D line as well.
So this is why we're exceedingly confident that we can achieve those minimum goals that we put out there for 2014 in
terms of at least achieving $3 billion in net income. And very much the performance we've seen year-to-date says that
we're absolutely on track to get there.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks, Derica.
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: Jami, this is John. Again thank you for your kind wishes there.
With respect to business development, let me put it in a couple of buckets. I think first of all we probably have been
most active in the animal health space where since about the middle of the last decade we've sort of done a deal a year
to sort of add to and augment our core animal health business in addition to getting good strong organic growth.
So I think you should expect that we're going to continue to be aggressive with respect to business development at a
still fairly modest scope and scale to help a $2 billion business today to get $3 billion and $4 billion beyond that. We
think that that's a great opportunity for our company.
With respect to the pharma part of the business, we continue to be vigilant, obviously, and on the lookout for
technology that we think could supplement or augment what we currently have coming out of our own pipeline. I think
our greatest challenge the next few years is to make sure that, despite the headwinds we face in patent expirations,
we're able to adequately fund the completion of these Phase III trials and make sure we have good launches with what
we hope will be a number of products as we come to the end of this patent expiration period.
I think if there's a wish list of sorts it would be, in my mind, a license deal or a smaller kind of acquisition that could
give us access to sales revenue in our biomedicines business between now and say 2017. Obviously those are hard to
come by, but we continue to be quite active in looking at these things. We're still not interested in large-scale M&A,
and our investors should not expect that.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks, John. Kathy, next caller, please.
Operator
Thank you. Next we have Steve Scala with Cowen. Go ahead please.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I have several questions.
First, on Cymbalta, what was the magnitude of this favorable wholesaler buying patterns? And doesn't Lilly expect
returns to commence before the patent expiration? So why is the company allowing wholesalers to buy extra stock
now? That's the first question.
Secondly, for Dr. Lundberg, so Lilly stopped development of its BACE inhibitor given molecule specific toxicity.
Would you share with us what aspect or feature of the molecule led to the toxicity?
And then lastly, what products fueled the 15% contribution from price in the U.S. in the second quarter? Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Steve. I think I'll go ahead and take your first question. We'll move to Jan for
the second and then Derica for the last.
On Cymbalta, sort of those two questions being related, the variations we saw in wholesaler inventory levels from Q1
of last year to Q2 of this year were within the normal ranges, it happened to be slightly favorable this quarter but was
not a significant driver of the growth.
Wholesalers on average are keeping a couple to a few weeks of inventory, Steve. It's not a large amount of inventory.
So we actually wouldn't expect that they would begin to ramp down purchases, for example, until you get into the

fourth quarter given that the patent expires December 11, I believe it is, of this year.
Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: Yeah. In relation to our BACE inhibitor, what we saw was elevation of liver enzymes
that came with time, which caused us actually then to stop this program. We believe it's likely to be molecule-specific
based on the totality of BACE biology, which has been published for humans and animal studies. It remains to be seen,
however, what happens with other BACE molecules.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Steve, in regards to the U.S. price benefit seen in this quarter and at the product level, the two
biggest drivers of that will be Cymbalta and Evista. Obviously it's very good for us in the quarter and for the year but
we know that will come to an end as we endure the patent expiry for those two products beginning in December and
then Q1 for Evista in 2014.

Thank you. We have Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much and first of all, let me echo the others and say it's great, John, to have
you back and hope everything went smoothly with the recovery.
Two questions. First, maybe for Derica. Can you just elaborate on the guidance update? I guess my question is, is the
move to the lower end of the expense ranges here driven by deeper than expected cost cutting and that you're finding
more to cut than you expected? Or is this more of a timing issue and that you're achieving targeted cost reductions
faster than you expected? I guess I'm just trying to read this. Is this just a matter of maximizing your pre-patent
expiration earnings? Or should we be thinking about this implying more confidence in 2014 and beyond?
The second question was, last year on this call you provided a longer-term view of the company that called for margins
to normalize over time. I guess sort of given the pipeline updates you've had over the past year, could you just update
both your comfort in that longer term view and perhaps maybe talk a little bit more about the time horizon with which
you believe you will kind of get margins back to a more normalized level once we kind of get through 2014? Thanks
very much.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Okay. Chris, this is Derica. In regards to the guidance update, it really is the organization
honestly is doing an outstanding job of just driving productivity gains that we think are sustainable across the business.
So these are not one-time effects, and so it absolutely gives us even greater confidence in our ability to meet those
minimums I talked about for 2014, especially the $3 billion in net income. And so we believe we are very much on
track to get to those goals.
And regards to the longer-term view, as you recall, you're correct this time last year we talked on our Q2 earnings call
for 2012, we talked about the opportunity for Lilly to begin to expand margins coming out of the 2014 trough and we
still fully see that as being an opportunity before us. Now the two elements that will drive us expanding those margins
is obviously we're planning on returning to revenue growth coming out of the loss of Cymbalta and Evista and that's in
that 2015, 2016, 2017 timeframe while at the same time being able to get greater leverage from both our commercial
and our manufacturing footprint and not having to grow those two cost bases or expense bases at the same rate as our
revenue growth and that's what's really going to drive that expansion.
Obviously, one of the questions we get often is, so, Derica, if you do not achieve the pipeline output that you're hoping
for, do you believe you can still expand margins? We still believe we can expand margins coming out. Obviously how
we get there will differ and it will depend upon which assets from the pipeline emerge or don't emerge. So that's why
we're not able to be more specific at this stage because we have to see how the pipeline itself specifically plays out.

Thank you. We have Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions. First, PCSK9 obviously there's a few others ahead
of you so I was curious how you think your product could differentiate in that market.
Second, can you give us more color on the animal health business? Last quarter we talked about supply and demand
getting a little bit out of whack during the quarter and I was wondering if that's gotten better and if you can talk a little
more there.
And then also third question is Europe. Can you talk about pricing in Europe? Have there been any major changes that
you've seen, any countries talking about major changes that we need to be watching for? Thanks.
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: If we go to PCSK9 first there, the cardiovascular area is a keen interest to Lilly for
instance, than the connection to diabetics which have a very high risk for cardiovascular disease. As you know we have
an oral CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib, in Phase 3 for cardiovascular prevention which then gives a very large HDL
elevation and strong LDL lowering, so I think it's a good strategic fit then to have a molecule which gives us a very
powerful LDL lowering. And our molecule, what we have seen in our earlier clinical trials is it could be a best-in-class
molecule with a very powerful LDL lowering with very long duration and of great magnitude.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Jan. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Marc, in regards to animal health, we did see a very solid bounce back in our animal health
business in the second quarter with 6% growth. As you saw from Ilissa's comments earlier that it was really driven by
good, strong growth in our companion animal business both inside the U.S. and outside the U.S. And also the good
news is we saw a further stabilization in our food animal business versus the drag that we were experiencing in Q1.
As we look forward, we still expect that we should be able to drive good growth in our animal health business both in
the second half of 2013 but as well as we think about 2014 in the future years. We are seeing some stabilization at the
producer level in terms of both the size of the herds as well as beginning to see some margin improvement in some of
the segments.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. And then in terms of European price, Marc, for the quarter, the European price impact
was minus 1%, at the lower end of our historical average of minus 1% to minus 3% in part due to the fact that in the
U.K. the current PPRS scheme actually calls for very modest but slight price increase in 2013.
In terms of developments moving forward, the French Government has talked about potential measures on some of the
hospital products. If those would go through, those could impact our business, particularly Alimta. Those could happen
yet this year or in 2014. That's unclear at this point in time.
And the other thing I'd flag is the U.K. where the current PPRS scheme does expire at the end of this year. Negotiations
are still ongoing for a new PPRS agreement that would start next year. Next year also would be the date that the U.K.
would start with its new value-based pricing scheme yet to be determined in terms of how it will be implemented for
new products.
On the U.K. front, one thing I would mention that has come up on some other calls earlier this quarter, U.K. had talked
about potential decreases of 10% to 20% on a certain bundle of products. And just to be clear, that impact will be zero
for Lilly, because that was to impact only those products for companies that do not participate in the PPRS scheme.
Lilly does participate in the PPRS scheme, would not be subject to any of those potential price declines.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Marc, this is Derica, again. Also, just one other comment on animal health, I failed to mention.
Do recall that as we look at the current projections for the animal health industry growth, it's still projected to be in the

Thank you. We have David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. And John, I wanted to add my congratulations, not only on the financial
upside, but your healthy return timing upside.
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: [Laughter] Thank you.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: So my three questions are as follows: Regarding ramucirumab, should we be expecting a
top-line press release before San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium or not?
Second, could you provide some perspective on the Humalog net price decline that was mentioned in the press release?
I'm guessing that's due to bundling to help drive Tradjenta access, but that's just a guess on my part.
And then third, I'm hoping you could talk a little bit about potentially bringing edivoxitene to market for depression,
and what the implications might be for your planning for the Cymbalta sales force? Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, Dave. Thank you for the questions. I think Jan, if you want to answer the ram top-line
press release part and San Antonio Breast question. Enrique on Humalog. Jan as well, if you wanted any comment on
edivoxitene. And then the last question, Dave, I missed?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: The sales force.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Derica, if you want to comment on the Cymbalta sales force expectation as we move
forward?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: Okay. So the ramucirumab data for breast cancer then are imminent, and the plan is
to have a top line press release before the San Antonio Breast meeting. In the best of worlds we could also present the
data at that meeting.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: You want to comment on the edivoxitene as well before we move on to Enrique?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: Well edivoxitene is the adjunct therapy then for depression, and there is a difference
of actually having an on-board SSRI, and adding on a treatment compared then to having Cymbalta where you have the
two mechanisms at the same time.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Okay, Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure, I – first just to clarify, there's no such bundling. This is really driven
quarter-to-quarter by variability that we see as we look at the rebate reserves and update them based on the latest
information that we basically have.
I would add just a bit of color to our insulin franchise because we are pleased in terms of where we are when we look at
our volume growth. In the US, aligned with the market right now and outside of the US it's slightly ahead in terms of
where the relevant for Humalog is. So we will likely continue to see some of these variabilities. There are no new
contracts when it comes to pricing that started in Q2. It is typical for us to look at new contracts at the start of the year.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Dave, real quick. If you're thinking about sort of first quarter, second quarter, you will see
that Humalog was up 9% in the US in the first quarter and relatively flat here in the second quarter. As Enrique alluded
to, that really is due to some base period entries that were made in Q1 and Q2 of 2012 related to Medicare and
Medicaid rebate true-ups. We continue to have sort of low to mid-single digit volume growth in the US, with pricing
relatively flat if you look over a couple quarter period. So that 9% and 0% you sort of average those and say we're in

that 4% to 5% growth, it is probably a more accurate reflection of the current run rate. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Dave, in regards to the Cymbalta sales force, again, as you know, we announced a restructuring
of our US sales force back in April. We reduced the size of our US footprint about 30%. Obviously this was in
anticipation of the impact of the patent expiries of both Cymbalta as well as Evista. We do believe at the same time that
this residual footprint that we have is sufficient to accommodate our pipeline going forward. So we were planning also
in terms of with foresight to what we think may emerge. And if we are successful with edivoxitene in terms – from a
regulatory standpoint, we think we can fit it into our existing commercial footprint.

We have John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. And again, John, welcome back and glad to hear you're going
full bore.
Just on lifecycle management of products towards the end of the lifecycles, most notably Cymbalta and Evista that you
alluded to. Are you managing those products a lot differently? In that it seems as though you need a lot less feet on the
street, but you're still growing volumes and it seems as though you're maximizing profitability on those assets. So any
thoughts on that?
Question for Jan on Phase 2 assets. What are the assets that you're most excited about? There's quite a few of them that
you have in Phase 2 development. But can you point to a couple that you're excited about?
And then for Derica on R&D, and also for Jan. As we look at R&D, certainly, as a percent of sales it's very high. But
just directionally, going forward, over the next couple of years as you realize and file quite a few of these assets, how
should we be thinking about the leverage that you're going to be getting out of that line going forward? Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, John. Thanks for the questions. I'll take your first and then, Jan, if you'll comment on
the pipeline assets, and then Derica on the R&D.
So clearly we are managing Cymbalta differently as we reach the end of its lifecycle, particularly here in the U.S. We
had talked about the fact that this would be a different sales force and marketing effort, as we approached patent
expiration compared to Zyprexa because each product is unique and requires a different approach.
You may recall, John, that we really ramped down and had no sales force efforts, or marketing efforts, to speak of
probably for a couple of years prior to the Zyprexa patent expiration. In this case, essentially, the sales force
announcement was made earlier this year. We basically have completed that as of this middle part of July, and have
minimal efforts, in terms of providing samples or the materials, responding to questions as we'll move into this last six
months of the patent here in the U.S.
We also talked about the fact that we would maintain marketing efforts, both direct-to-consumer television as well as
other media, up until much later in the lifecycle for Cymbalta, and that continues to be the case. Obviously, those have
begun to ramp down and we will ramp down as we reach the patent expiration, again, leading to some of the
year-on-year cost savings, in addition to the sales force that we talked about earlier. Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: Yeah. So let me start with one of the most recent molecules. The prostaglandin E
synthase inhibitor, which has been a difficult to drug target. But we now have a compound in Phase II for pain
indication. And this is prostacyclin-sparing, which could mean that it has a better safety profile than the current
candidate.

Blosozumab, as you know, is our sclerostin antibody, which recently reported intriguing data then on increasing bone
mineral density, both in the spine and to some extent also in the hip region.
The glucagon receptor antagonist is an oral molecule then for diabetes type II, where we recently also reported
promising data of blood glucose lowering without any weight gain or risk for hypoglycemia.
We have our TGF-beta monoclonal antibody for chronic renal disease or chronic kidney disease, which then we have in
large Phase II trials.
In the oncology area, I would like to mention three: the TGF-beta oral molecule, the CDK 4/6 which we also discussed,
and our c-MET antibody for a variety of tumors.
And finally, I think we already mentioned the PCSK9 antibody then for lipid lowering. So we have a number of agents
in Phase II to talk about.
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: Thanks, Jan. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: John, in regards to R&D costs, as I stated earlier just in terms of our overall operating statistics,
as we look to complete or conclude some of the large Phase III studies that are currently under way, obviously
progressing towards submission and hopefully approval, that will give us some relief in terms of our R&D expense
going forward.
So we believe that we're kind of at a peak at the moment. So when I look forward to future periods, you should see kind
of a relief of pressure, and that does obviously help us in terms of achieving our goal of $3 billion while not sacrificing
the replenishment and the future progressing of our clinical development pipeline.
So we are trying to make sure that we maintain a very good balance between both our current Phase 3s as well as the
questions you just had for Jan, at least to ensure that there's a cohort of opportunities that can follow such that we can
avoid hopefully future droughts as you've seen from Lilly over a number of years and are learning from our Prozac
scenario.
So we feel very good about the late stage and the early stage balance that we're looking at today.

Thank you. We have Damien Conover with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
<Q - Damien Conover>: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a question on pricing power in
the U.S. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, can you talk about the pricing power in the U.S.? And I think historically we
look at pricing power in the U.S. in kind of the mid-single digit range. I was wondering if you still think given the
current environment kind of extrapolating that into the future makes sense?
And then just one quick follow-up, on the biosimilar filing of the glargine product in Europe, I just want to confirm that
you're still looking at that launch as more of a branded launch even though you're taking the biosimilar filing strategy
there. Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, Damien, thanks for the questions. Enrique, I'm going to switch it up on you, if you
want to answer the second question first, and then either Derica or I will handle your first question, Damien. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Yes, absolutely. As we have stated in the past, I think our intent is to offer a second high
quality glargine option for patients. We believe the competition is going to be driven by the experiences of those
individual patients. We have to remember here that [indiscernible] (55:21) play a critical role as well as the level of
support and service that we provide both to the physicians and their staff. So yeah, we are thinking that the market
dynamics are more closely going to resemble that of a branded market.

<A - Philip L. Johnson>: And, Damien, on pricing in the U.S., as we go through this pre-patent expiration period
given some of the dynamics, you are seeing and probably will see higher-than-average U.S. net price increases. We
don't expect those to be sustained after this period and we'll go back to probably more normal increases, as you
mentioned, probably in that mid to upper single digit range depending on where we are in the lifecycle and new product
launches.
Now we have seen over time, probably the last five years, increasing pressure where a greater percentage of list price
increases is essentially given back in the form of rebates and discounts, in other words leading us to realize instead of
two-thirds of list price increases closer to half of list price increases on average. At this point I don't think we expect
significant additional pressure on U.S. pricing, but we certainly don't expect to see the pressure that has currently
existed abating at all.

first half results this year that have positioned us to raise our full year 2013 guidance and put us on track to meet or
exceed our minimum financial goals through 2014. We continue to progress the pipeline and are confident we'll have
four regulatory submissions of molecules this year, frankly an unprecedented number for a company of our size or
probably of any size in the industry. We're very pleased with the progress we've made on the pipeline.
Just a quick reminder that prior to our third quarter call, the next major event we have at which we hope to see many of
you or hopefully you would dial in, is our October 3 investment community meeting that we'll be holding here in
Indianapolis.
Once again, thank you for your interest in Eli Lilly & Company. We're very appreciative. And hope you have a great
day.

Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation
and choosing AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.
