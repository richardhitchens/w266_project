changes help you in your analysis of Weyerhaeuser.
As summarized on chart 1, this morning Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter 2012 net earnings of $41 million or $0.08
per diluted share on net sales of $1.5 billion. Earnings for the first quarter include after-tax gains of $32 million from
special items. A GAAP reconciliation of earnings before special items can be found on chart 2. This table now details
special items on a pre-tax and an after-tax basis.
The special items for the first quarter are a gain of $34 million or $0.06 per share for a post-retirement plan
amendment, a gain of $8 million or $0.02 per share for income tax settlement, and a charge of $10 million or $0.02 per
share for restructuring, impairments and other items. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $9
million or $0.02 per diluted share.
Turning to our business segment discussion, my comments reviewing the first quarter of 2012 refer to changes from the
fourth quarter of 2011. This will be the same for all segments. Beginning with Timberlands, charts 3 and 4. The graphs
on chart 4 have been redesigned. The West and the South are now on separate charts, each graphing third party log
sales versus realizations. Graphs on Intersegment Log Sales, West and South, and Fee Harvest Volume, West and
South, have also been included.
Timberlands contributed $71 million to pre-tax earnings, $1 million more than in Q4. Income from operations
increased $13 million. This increase was primarily due to lower equipment and road maintenance costs in the West.
This increase was largely offset by a $12 million reduction in earnings from the disposition of non-strategic timberland.
Western log sale volumes were flat. Third party sales volumes declined 6%, primarily due to fewer log sales to China.
Log exports to Japan, however, have increased. Japan accounted for 78% of log exports in Q1 versus 68% in Q4.
Exports to Korea, a small market, also increased.
Price realizations for logs in the West declined less than $1 per 1,000 cubic meters. Price realizations for logs exported
to Japan slightly increased. Southern log sales volumes were flat. Third party sales decreased as internal sales increased
due to strong southern yellow pine lumber demand. The combined fee harvest volumes of the West and South rose 2%.
Wood Products, charts 5 and 6. Chart 6 has been reorganized into four product graphs of price and volume. First
quarter operating income improved $39 million from fourth quarter. Sales volumes and price realizations increased
across all product lines. Operating rates were higher. Lumber volumes were up 9% and lumber prices increased 5% or
$15 per 1,000 board feet. Oriented strand board volumes were up 9%. Price realizations rose 14% or $24 per 1,000
square feet. Engineered wood solid section volumes increased 16%. Solid section price realizations were up 3%.
Engineered wood TJI volume was 7% higher. TJI prices increased 2%. Manufacturing costs were lower due to more
mill uptime and product throughput. Trade expense increased, largely due to higher shipment volumes and an increase
in fuel costs.
Cellulose Fibers, charts 7 and 8. Pulp sales volumes and price realizations are on the same graph on chart 8. The pre-tax
contribution to earnings from Cellulose Fibers decreased $90 million in Q1 from Q4. Average pulp price realizations
declined 9% or $76 per air-dried metric ton. Pulp sales volumes decreased 4%. Q1 had two scheduled annual
maintenance outages totaling 27 days of downtime. There were no scheduled maintenance outages in Q4. Due to the
scheduled downtime, maintenance costs increased significantly, and pulp production volumes were 5% lower.
Real Estate, charts 9 and 10. Chart 10 contains graphic representations of the metrics formerly presented in a table
format. The pre-tax contribution to earnings from real estate declined $49 million from fourth quarter. First quarter is
seasonally the weakest quarter of the year for single-family home closings. In Q1, single-family home closings declined
to 349 from 582 in Q4. Closings were 4% lower than a year ago first quarter. The average home sales price was
$376,000, 6% lower than in Q4 and 10% below the first quarter of 2011. Gross margins decreased to 17% from 25% in
Q4. The gross margin was 22% in Q1 2011. Price and margin declines were attributable to mix.
The cancellation rate dropped to 10% from 18% in Q4. The cancellation rate was 12% in the year ago quarter. The
backlog increased from 429 single-family homes in Q4 to 777 homes. However, the average price of single-family
homes in the backlog has decreased to $371,000 due to mix. The backlog at the end of the first quarter last year was
611 single-family homes. There was $1 million in land and lot sales in first quarter. Land and lot sales were $19 million

And now I would like to turn over the call to Dan Fulton. Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As I begin, I want to start by reflecting on my
remarks from our 2011 year end earnings call. At that time, when we provided our outlook for the first quarter, we
highlighted three major external forces that we believed could affect our 2012 financial performance. One, the pace of
housing recovery; two, weakening log demand from China offset by continuing strong demand from Japan; and three,
softness in pulp prices related to high inventories worldwide and economic uncertainty in global markets. We
emphasized that we were focused on improvement across all business segments in areas that we can control. Though
cautious about the economic conditions, we stated we were prepared to flex up to meet increased demand if markets
improved more rapidly.
Let me first provide an update on these three external forces. First, housing. During the first quarter, the signs of
improvement in the U.S. housing market that began to emerge late last year continued. On our call in early February, I
told you that we were basing our 2012 plans on 665,000 total U. S. housing starts, 445,000 single-family plus 210,000
multi-family. We considered this to be a conservative assumption and I shared that we were planning cautiously given
the uncertain economic environment as well as our experience in 2011. I said that once we were further along into the
normal spring selling season we would have a better idea of what to expect for the year. So today is a good time for a
status report.
As we approach the end of April, we've seen continued improvement in U.S. housing. As a result, we have increased
our forecast for U.S. starts by an additional 8%, from 665,000 to 720,000. The forecast assumes 500,000 single-family
and 220,000 multi-family starts. This would be nearly a 20% increase over 2011 levels.
The increased sales activity experienced by WRECO and other builders during the first quarter does not have a
significant effect on first quarter results for our businesses. This is due to the time lag between new orders, permits and
then starts. The sales activity does, however, provide some indication of what we can expect for the balance of the year
for our Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate segments.
Second, Asian markets. In the fourth quarter, we reported slowing demand from China for logs. We anticipated
continued weakness in Chinese demand in the early part of 2012. However, we expected that demand from Japan, by
far our largest export market, would increase. And it did. Third, we expressed concerns about softening pulp prices. We
felt the effect of this softening in the first quarter. Today, softwood pulp index pricing appears to be stabilizing.
Now let me provide some comments about the performance of each of our business segments during the quarter. In
Timberlands, harvest volumes were up slightly in both the South and the West, despite some difficult weather
conditions in the West. As expected, Chinese demand for logs slowed. Our export volumes shifted to a richer mix of
logs to Japan, where we have strong long-term presence, offsetting the decline in Chinese demand. In Wood Products,
performance improved compared with last year and sequentially as compared with last quarter. We are seeing results
from our ongoing improvement efforts across the entire segment. Sales volumes are up year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter. Much of our increased volume is coming from new market initiatives. These include sales in new
geographies, increased lumber exports and increased repair remodel sales.
Later this year we should begin to see increased volume for all product lines, tied to the improved spring housing sales
I mentioned earlier. Our volume increase resulted in higher operating rates across all product lines, a welcome and

much-needed improvement. Higher operating rates reduced per unit manufacturing costs and contribute to our
improved profitability. Though we're still not where we want to be, the combination of these improvements narrowed
our operating loss significantly compared with last quarter.
In WRECO, closings for the first quarter were slightly lower than one year ago as a result of a lower backlog as we
entered the year. As Kathy reported, margins for the quarter were lower, primarily as a result of mix. Mix is affected by
margin variability across markets, by the relative share of closings from our respective markets and in some cases, by
the relative share of closings from attached and detached product.
In the first quarter we had a higher percentage of closings from lower margin and lower priced markets, such as
Phoenix, as compared with the higher margin and higher priced markets of San Diego and Washington DC. As both a
builder and a land developer, the sale of land and lots to other builders is an integral part of our long-term strategy. On
average, land sales represent about 10% of our revenue, but the timing of land and lot sales can be a bit uneven
throughout the year, as Kathy noted in her comparisons of land and lot sales in the first quarter versus the fourth
quarter.
Earlier this month we successfully closed the sale of a master plan community in Houston that Patty will discuss in her
outlook remarks. The positive news for WRECO and perhaps for the overall market is that our traffic is up,
cancellations are down and sales per community increased by 32%. The result was a 30% increase in first quarter sales
over last year. Sales increases during the quarter were the strongest in Arizona, Las Vegas, Puget Sound and Houston,
and weakest in Southern California. This increase in sales resulted in an encouraging increase in our backlog, up 27%
compared with one year ago and up 80% from year end.
In Cellulose Fibers, we expected a significant decline in earnings compared to the fourth quarter as a result of lower
prices and expense related to scheduled annual maintenance shutdowns. During the quarter, our mills ran well and
came up on time after our scheduled annual shutdowns. The shutdowns were successfully conducted with no
recordable safety incidents. Some of the work accomplished during these scheduled shutdowns will help us move
towards our goal of increasing the length of time between major shutdowns to 18 months rather than every 12 months.
This transition will occur over a several year period. As we enter the second quarter, worldwide inventory levels have
fallen to more normal levels and prices are increasing.
And now I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss second quarter outlook as well as provide financial highlights.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. We expect improved operating results from each of our business segments
in the second quarter as compared to the first. The outlook for the second quarter by business segment is summarized
on chart 11.
I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberland. Beginning in the West, export volumes are expected to be flat to the
first quarter, with realizations softening only slightly. China markets are not anticipated to improve until the second
half of this year and Japan market realizations could be slightly lower in the second quarter, due to ongoing competitive
pressure from European supply as a result of a weaker euro compared to the yen.
Domestically in the West, sales volumes and prices should increase compared to the first quarter, resulting from a slight
seasonal pick up in demand. We expect Western fee harvest volumes to increase approximately 5% to 10% compared
to the first quarter. In the South, log realizations are anticipated to be flat and fee harvest volumes are expected to
increase approximately 5% as a result of seasonal demand.
We anticipate a seasonal increase in silvicultural cost in both the West and South, and fuel costs are expected to remain
high. Overall, we estimate that earnings in the Timberland segment will be approximately 10% higher in the second
quarter compared to the first. In Wood Products, we expect increased revenue in the second quarter compared to the
first. Volumes are anticipated to increase approximately 10%, average sales realizations in lumber are estimated to be
approximately 5% higher.

Realizations in our other product lines are mixed, but could be somewhat softer in the second quarter compared to the
first if the price trends of last year repeat, although OSB realization thus far in the quarter are stronger than Q1. Overall
log costs are expected to increase slightly during the quarter. Log costs in the West and Canada should be higher, but
modestly lower in the South. Manufacturing costs are estimated to be lower due to improved operating rates. Freight
spending will increase due to higher shipment volumes and increased fuel cost.
We expect continuing improvement in our operating results in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. We
anticipate approximately breakeven performance for the second quarter. Given these expected results, Wood Products
would generate around $30 million of EBITDA. While the performance in this segment is not yet where we expect it to
be, breakeven is a significant improvement over the $53 million operating loss we incurred in the second quarter of
2011.
In Cellulose Fibers, average sales realizations for pulp are anticipated to increase modestly in the second quarter
compared to the first, due to improving market conditions and tightening supply. Worldwide inventory levels have
decreased due to significant shipments to China and spring annual maintenance shuts. As of the end of the first quarter,
the supply of softwood inventory is at a low of 29 days.
Maintenance expense is estimated to increase in the second quarter due to some carryover expenses from the two mills
which had annual maintenance shuts in the first quarter. In addition, we will have similar scheduled maintenance costs
for the mills scheduled for their annual shuts in the second quarter. Outages this year are slightly longer than typical in
order to complete capital projects focused on cost reduction and to position the mills to begin the process of
transitioning to an 18-month frequency and planned maintenance outages, as Dan mentioned. We expect overall
earnings in our Cellulose Fiber segments to be approximately 10% higher in the second quarter compared to the first.
Moving on to our Real Estate business. As Dan discussed, we continue to see slowly improving housing demands.
Closings in our single-family home building business are expected to improve by over 30%, from 349 closings in the
first quarter to approximately 460 in the second quarter. This increase reflects a normal seasonal pickup in addition to
the slightly improved market.
Average prices are estimated to decline approximately 4% due to mix, while gross margins are expected to increase
slightly but remain under 20%. Selling expenses will increase with the additional closing volumes. Earlier this month,
we closed on the sale of a large land parcel in the Houston area, known as Cross Creek Ranch. The sales price for this
transaction was $100 million and it is expected to contribute about $10 million to earnings in the second quarter.
Including the earnings from this sale, we expect that our real estate segment will generate a slight profit in the second
quarter.
Now I'll wrap up with some overall company financial comments. Please turn to chart 12 for this discussion. We ended
the quarter with a cash balance of almost $730 million. Cash from operations in the first quarter was negative $60
million. This reflects increased working capital of $148 million in our Forest Products businesses for the typical
seasonal working capital billed, primarily in our Wood Products and Timberland businesses. In addition, the first
quarter included the cost of scheduled annual maintenance in our Cellulose Fibers business. The first quarter was also
the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for our Real Estate business as compared to the fourth quarter, which is
typically our strongest quarter for cash generation.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $64 million. We expect spending to increase in the second quarter
compared to the first. Major projects with second quarter spending include a pulp converting facility in Poland, a fiber
line upgrade in our pulp mill in Columbus, Mississippi and an evaporator upgrade at our pulp mill in Grande Prairie,
Alberta, Canada. We expect capital spending, including reforestation, to be around $290 million for the full year. Our
near-term debt maturities for the next five years are also shown on chart 12. As you can see, we have total maturities of
approximately $610 million, well below our existing cash balance. In addition, we have a four year credit facility for $1
billion with no borrowings outstanding.
We continue to focus on controlling costs across the company. This includes a relentless effort to lower our SG&A
costs. As shown in our income statement, SG&A in the first quarter of last year was $172 million compared to $150

million this year, a reduction of $22 million. This emphasis on cost reduction should result in even greater leverage as
we began to experience a housing recovery.
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions. Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Patty. In summary, we're encouraged by our performance during the quarter. We continue to focus on
improving our financial results with current market conditions. The performance of our Wood Products segment during
the quarter is evidence of this progress. The increasing housing demand that we are now experiencing, if sustained, will
give us the opportunity to flex up to meet profitable demand in our Timberlands, Wood Products, and Real Estate
segments by increasing harvest levels, wood products production, and home construction. Continued firming of pulp
pricing will position us for improving results from our Cellulose Fibers segment. We remain committed to safely
improving our overall performance and we're well positioned to take full advantage of opportunities that emerge from
an improving market.
And now we welcome your questions.
Kathryn F. McAuley
Nicole, would you please open the floor for questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: I appreciate all the additional details. I appreciate all the additional details. My first
question is around chart 10 and WRECO. And it's encouraging to obviously, the lower cancellation rates, the buyer
traffic picking up. One of the interesting data points here is the price in your backlog, which has been trending lower.
And I guess my question here is how much of this is cyclical from what you see, Dan, or are there any secular
implications that we should take away from the declining price in the backlog that could impede the recovery
ultimately in WRECO in profitability when we finally see more and more closings and starts?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The primary reason for the decline in the price in backlog, George, is answered by mix. So as
I mentioned in my remarks, we have mix issues across our various markets. We have higher priced product for instance
in San Diego and the Washington D.C. area, lower priced product in places like Phoenix. And what we've seen over the
last three months to six months that is reflected in our backlog is a recovery in sales in some of those lower priced
markets ahead of what we're longer term expecting to see coming from, let's say, southern California. So we had a very
significant increase in activity, for instance, in Arizona, not just in last quarter, but really going back probably six
months. And Arizona generally is a lower priced market, those are lower margins and so that's also impacting our
margins.
So it is more of a mix issue. We also had, for instance in Washington D.C., which is a higher priced market, a period of
time where we had heavier shift to multi-family. So we're in some larger master plan communities, for example. In
some of those master plans, we have a requirements to build affordable housing as part of the entitlement process, those

are lower priced units. And so that would affect both the margin that you see falling as well sale price.
So it is more a function of where the homes are and for instance, in some markets we are beginning to be able to pass
through price increases. So I think that most of the price decline due to the softness of the market is behind us, and
there will be some choppiness as mix shifts – as we come out of this and we'll try to keep you informed so that there's
no surprises.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. The related question and I have one last follow-on, would it be fair to say then, given
the ultimate lag in trend and how they'll materialize in your performance, the recent improvement in pricing, that you
could see single-family margins more or less close to where they were last year in the back half? Should we ultimately
get to better than breakeven, better than marginal loss in WRECO in the second half in single-family?
And then the second question I had, a totally different topic, in terms of Cellulose Fibers, relative to the rest of your
portfolio and what you're trying to build within Weyerhaeuser, it's obvious you've done a great job of improving your
returns here, but it still remains a very cyclical and capital-intensive business. From where you sit right now, why do
you think that Cellulose Fibers is still a good business to maintain the portfolio for Weyerhaeuser for your
shareholders? Thanks and good luck on the quarter.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Thanks, George. To your question of WRECO and the balance of the year, yes, we will return
to profitability. What happens in the first quarter is that it is our lowest quarter for closings and so we end up in a loss
position fundamentally because of G&A. And as the volume picks up through the year, then you'll see us breaking into
profitability. As Patty mentioned, we expect to be profitable in the second quarter. And then through the balance of the
year, we'll be delivering the homes that we had sold earlier in the year so we'll have the margins from those sales come
through the P&L. So we would certainly expect that to recover.
In terms of what the margins may be in the balance of the year, we have good visibility today for second quarter
margins. It gets a little bit fuzzier as we look at third and fourth quarter because we – some of the closings that will
have occurred in the third and fourth quarter will be from sales that we haven't even entered into yet.
With respect to Cellulose Fibers and your portfolio question, we believe that the Cellulose Fibers business is a good fit
for our portfolio. We are a strong competitor in the fluff business in particular where we have very strong relationships
with growing global customers. What the Cellulose Fibers business does for us is it gives us really terrific global
exposure because we've got roughly two thirds of our sales are for customers outside of the U.S. And so we believe
long-term trends for demand for fluff are very positive.
And the relationships that we are building with our customers that are growing give us confidence that we will be able
to maintain profitability and grow with them. Patty mentioned when she was talking about projects that we're spending
money on this year in our CapEx, the Poland facility. So that's a conversion facility that will give us increased product
to sell to key global customers as they expand into Europe and North Africa. And we believe that we're a strong
competitor in that business and it's a good fit for us.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thank you, Dan.

guess just the level of trend? Was it getting worse as you moved through the first quarter? Was it picking up in terms of
I guess the Chinese market particularly? And are there any sort of numbers that you can put it to in terms of the change
in your export volume to China?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: You were breaking up at the very end of your question, Gail. Could I just ask you to...
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Sure.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I'm sorry.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Are there any numbers that you can – the last part was are there any numbers you can put to
in terms of the change in your volume to China, either year-over-year or sequentially? And just generally give a context
on what the trends were like moving through the quarter into the second quarter?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: So our overall export volumes were slightly off in the first quarter as compared to the fourth
quarter. That's fundamentally a China statement. As I mentioned, we had a significant slowdown in exports to China
starting in the fourth quarter, continuing into the first quarter, and that caused a shift in mix. So in very round numbers,
about 80% of our export volume went to Japan, 10% Korea, slightly more than 10% going to China.
If I were to go back to the fourth quarter, those numbers were sort of mid 60s% for Japan, China has actually grown to
be 25% of our export volume. So we are returning to more typical mix. Our long-term market continues to be Japan.
Those are higher quality logs. That's our most valuable resource that we're exporting off of the West Coast, and we see
that demand continuing to be steady and it has been growing.
We are well positioned to sell into the China market, as we did last year, because of the location of our lands and just
the advantaged facilities that we have to ship off the West Coast. So longer term, we continue to expect export to be a
significant part of our activity off the West Coast. Japan will continue to be our major market, but we will take
advantage of opportunities to serve longer-term customers in Korea, to build market share in China, and also to take
advantage of opportunities that are beginning to emerge in some other export markets beyond those big three.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Gail, to your specific question about in the first quarter, we saw coming out of the fourth
quarter a lot of inventory in China and into the first quarter. And some of that was also due to some of the Chinese
government policy, which we are starting to see some signs of monetary easing by the Chinese government. So that's
encouraging.
In terms of the impact going into the second quarter, we don't see a lot of pick up, but we see some of that inventory
being worked off. So that's why in my comments, I focused primarily on the second half of the year in terms of the
resurgence of Chinese demand. We don't see a lot of that impact of it happening in the second quarter, but rather that
inventories continue to be worked down.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And will those comments hold generally for the lumber exports? I think you have
some exposure to that out of Canada going into China. And if so, is there any risk or are you seeing signs of some of
that being repatriated?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I'm sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to ask that question one more time.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Sure. I mean do these comments hold for lumber as well? And if so, are you seeing any
signs of volumes that might have gone to China previously kind of being repatriated in North America?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, we have been shipping some lumber to China out of Canada. And actually on a
year-over-year basis, our export volume to China out of Canada roughly doubled. They have – as you know, the wood
that goes to China is used for industrial purposes, concrete forms, and packing and crating, at least as it relates to soft
wood. So the Chinese government did impose credit controls to try to slow down growth, to try to slow down some real
estate development.

We would expect that activity to start to recover. We'll continue to take advantage of that opportunity as it exists. In our
lumber business out of Canada, once again, our primary customer has been Japan, and that's a higher quality wood than
is going to China. But we'll take advantage of the opportunities as they present themselves. We are – in our Wood
Products business, we are exporting lumber. We are also starting to export some amount of OSB and engineered
products into Asia also.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, Gail, I really think as it relates to our lumber export, as Dan said, similar to logs,
Japan is a much more important market for us because most of our lumber production comes out of Alberta. It's not as
affected by the beetle-damaged wood as some of the other producers. So we produce and export more to Japan of a
higher J-grade than probably other producers that you might be hearing from.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay, and just two quick ones. The guidance for Timberlands in the second quarter, does
that include land sales, or would land sales be additive or subtractive to that?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: You know, we don't forecast land sales because they are lumpy. But I can tell you based
upon what we see right now, that we wouldn't see a big difference in the second quarter compared to the first. But as
we've talked about in the past, that can move around. But as we sit here today, it doesn't make a big difference
quarter-over-quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And, Patty, is there any guidance for the Unallocated Items? I think in the past you
had talked about maybe $80 million for the year. You were well below that in the first quarter. Would you expect that
to normalize or is there any change structurally there?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, what we tried to do on that chart 13 was to really give you what makes up that. So as
you think about walking down that chart, the unallocated corporate functional expenses, I wouldn't see that changing
significantly throughout the year in terms of the quarter impact. The unallocated share-based comp does move around
because that's tied to – for the most part, the volatility in our stock price. Pension and post-retirement costs, probably
pretty stable. Foreign exchange gains, that's the result of changes in primarily the Canadian dollar on our intercompany
borrowings. So those would be the primary items that you'd think about.
So as the foreign exchange, Canadian dollar, if that moves around, that will impact that number. Just roughly I would
say probably a $0.01 change makes about a $3 million-ish, give or take. And it's – also it's a function of the currency
fluctuation as well as the level of borrowings intercompany, how that goes through year-to-year – or quarter-to-quarter.
And then on share-based comp, probably about a $1 dollar movement in the stock price is roughly $1.5 million to $2
million, so maybe that will help you calibrate throughout the quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And just that Other segment? Because that was a pretty swing quarter-on-quarter...
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yeah, that's just really made up of a bunch of little things. There's a whole list of – that's why
we didn't call out anything separately there. Other is a bunch of $1 million or $2 million kind of unique items
quarter-over-quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. But is the fourth quarter kind of a more normal number or is it just completely
random?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: It's kind of random. I would say it's probably somewhere between that $2 million and $7
million number.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: You bet.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.
<Q - Kurt Schoen>: Good morning. This is Kurt Schoen filling in for Mark.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Schoen>: Good morning. So you noted earlier that there was a pick up in the lower priced housing markets,
which I guess also happened to be the hardest hit markets. Given your heavy exposure there, do you expect your
housing segment to recover quicker than the overall industry? And will this dynamic alter your allocation of resources
or strategy going forward?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I don't expect that it changes our strategy long term. So what we're seeing is – housing is a
regional business and we do have different value propositions in each market. I talked about the recovery in demand, in
particular in Arizona. That happens to be a market that has good positive employment growth. And on the last call, I
think I noted that last year there were nearly 100,000 housing transactions in the Phoenix market. So that market seems
to have recovered just as we're starting to see some recovery in Florida. We're not an active builder there, but investors
have come in and have picked up excess inventory, and so the market is now starting to recover.
So the lower priced markets where we operate, Phoenix, we're seeing stronger recovery. I noted Las Vegas in my
comments. Las Vegas is coming off of a very, very low base, but we did see a pick up on a year-over-year basis, sales
in Las Vegas. Transactions are starting to occur. We had two new openings in Las Vegas, actually higher priced
product that sold very well. So it's not simply people that are looking for foreclosed homes that are buying homes.
The markets are starting to recover. So I don't expect our strategy to change in any of our given markets. We will
allocate capital in order to provide lots to be able to build those homes on a market by market basis. But I don't see any
significant shift longer term for us in our value propositions in markets or in the longer-term mix of homes.
<Q - Kurt Schoen>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Hi, Mark.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Just curious, Dan and Patty, as you think about sort of a housing upturn and how it will
affect your different Wood Products businesses, can you help us think about sort of where you think you have the
greatest leverage to increase volumes in Wood Products?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yes, so our primary products in our Wood Products business are lumber and OSB and
engineered wood products, which we split between our TJIs and our solid sections. Lumber has throughout the cycle
maintained a somewhat higher operating rate because there are multiple outlets for lumber. As we see the market pick
up for housing, you would expect to see lumber pick up along with the appropriate level of starts.
OSB is a product that is more heavily weighted to new construction, but we have some industrial uses and we've been
expanding our activity in the R&R market. So as you see a pick up in activity, that should translate very quickly into
OSB. That has had a somewhat lower operating rate than lumber because we've had fewer outlets for that product.
In the engineered business, our TJIs and solid sections, that's fundamentally a new construction product, either for
single-family or multi-family. And so that probably has the most significant immediate impact as the activity picks up
either for singles or multis, that product goes into both. And so we have the most leverage on the upside coming from

that business because we've got the lowest operating rates today, Mark, in that product line.
And then there's still an issue out there as to the mix between singles and multis and what the appropriate square
footages are for each of those. But I think the most significant upside in those three product lines in a pick up in
housing would be seen in the engineered business because we've got lowest operating rates, and so much more ability
to increase production there. But you'll see it in all product lines.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay, all right. Maybe when you're out here, it would be good – I would like to get a
little update on sort of what your building products distribution business looks like right now, because I know you've
made a lot of changes. A couple of other questions for today, though. Can you give us, Dan, just a sort of a rule of
thumb in your Real Estate business about sort of profit that you make from home building versus profit that you make
from the gain on the underlying land?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Can't do that because it varies by market and by project. And let me give you an example,
Mark, in probably the two extremes would be Houston, Texas where historically we have purchased auctioned lots
from land developers. So fundamentally the primary profit and margin is that you see in Houston comes from home
building. We do, as you know, have some land development activity down there, but roughly two thirds of our homes
in Houston are built on lots that we purchased from others.
The other extreme would be San Diego where we've got a long land position in a market that is very difficult to obtain
entitlements and that's the nature of why we have a longer land position there. And so in a – the margins that come
from our San Diego homes have – are a lot higher and clearly, there's a significant component of that relates to the
land. But I can't give you a rule of thumb across all markets because every market is different and quite frankly, every
project has some unique history to it as to who own the land and how long it was owned and whether it was ours or
someone else's.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay. And then the last question I had, Dan, was just on sort of offshore timberlands. I
noticed the pricing continues to be pretty low down there in Uruguay. I'm just curious as to whether that's because that's
kind of timber that doesn't have a whole lot of outlets right now. And I'm also interested in whether you want to expand
offshore timber, whether it's more in South America or more may be over in Asia?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Our offshore timber is really located in two markets, as you know. Uruguay is our largest
position, we have roughly 345,000 acres and then we've got a small joint-venture in Fujian Province in Southern China,
that's about a 50,000 acre partnership. We are growing out the timberland in Uruguay. We started with range land and
planted it. It is now moving to a stage of harvest maturity. We're growing primarily to a saw timber regime in that
market. We have one manufacturing facility, it's a plywood mill that we built where we are producing plywood. And I
think it's an area of the world, quite frankly, that could use some more conversion facilities in order to monetize the
timber that is growing there. So we're well situated with our plywood mill.
We've seen some improvement in performance out of that. That mill originally was built with the thought that the
market would primarily be Southeastern U.S. And it's turned out because of the U.S. housing downturn, most of that
product is being sold throughout South America and increasingly, Mexico, with some outlet into Europe for higher
grade tropical panel replacement. So that's all the that color that I can add. At this point, in terms of expanding
Timberlands ownership, our focus is U.S., it's not global for a variety of reasons. We know the U.S. the best and the
U.S. is one of the few markets in the world where you can own the fee, which is important.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay, great. Thanks for the better disclosure this quarter, by the way.

Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Chip.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning, Chip.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: When you look at the progression of Southern fee harvest levels, they just go up. And you
mentioned, they're going to go up again in the second quarter. But I just noticed they went up every quarter last year
and further in the first quarter. And I know, obviously, from the years past, you've talked about having greater ability or
greater growth that you would harvest in the future. But it's up I guess, roughly, 25% year-over-year and with more to
come. I would like to know sort of what's driving that and sort of how we should think about the harvest there going
forward?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We have – prices have been relatively steady in that marketplace. We made a conscious
decision, Chip, to increase the amount of third party sales. So that was a market where, historically, most of the logs
went to our own mills. We felt that we needed and wanted some diversification. And so we've consciously increased
sales to third parties; they're roughly 20% to 25% of our Southern harvest. And then this year with the increasing
lumber prices and some recovery in U.S. housing, we are flowing more of those logs to our own conversion facilities to
take advantage of the increased activity or the increase prices in lumber. So it's been a conscious decision on our part to
increase harvest because we have profitable outlets for the logs.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Got you. And secondly on just the tax rate, if you – your forecast as you have given us the
numbers is roughly correct – and maybe you mentioned this and I missed it, what should the tax rate be in the quarter
and what would be your sort of range that you would use for the year? And I know it's a moving part based on how
much timberland contributes, but is there any kind of rule of thumb you can give us?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Chip. Let me maybe walk through a couple of things that could help you as you go
forward. So as you mentioned, it is sensitive to the mix of REIT income versus TRS income, and of course we don't
provide for any tax, corporate tax on the REIT income. So as you think about the TRS income, which is primarily the
income from our manufacturing businesses, Cellulose Fibers, Wood Products, and our WRECO subsidiary, but also
remember that the interest expenses at the TRS as well.
So as we look forward for this year for the rate on the TRS results, we're looking at an effective rate of about 25%. And
if you look at the first quarter, and now these are just broad rules of thumb, but if you looked at the first quarter and
said, take the contribution to pre-tax earnings and exclude the special items, and then take away the Timberland
earnings and take away the interest expense, you'd get a TRS loss of about $83 million.
And then, again, if you exclude out of the tax benefit the impact of the special items, which you can get from chart 2 in
the package, you'll get about 25% rate for the first quarter. And we would see that 25% rate being the effective rate for
the year, again, depending upon what the ultimate mix of income is. That 25% is lower than what the U.S. statutory rate
is because of the mix of U.S. versus non-U.S. earnings.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: And again, if I heard you correctly, you would – basically the REIT income, the Timberland
segment income is fully non-taxable and – in other words, all of the expenses, whether it be unallocated or interest, will
be almost all allocated to the TRS?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, so all of the interest expenses at the TRS. As it relates to Timberland results, there
are pieces in both, but most of the Timberland income is at the REIT level. So it's, just as a broad rule of thumb, if you
take the Timberland income away, you get pretty close.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Got you. So there should be probably no tax expense in the next quarter, then?

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Anthony.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Just a follow-up to Gail's question on China. Understanding that we've seen selectivity in
the first quarter and you expect some pick up in the second half of the year, when you look at kind of the full-year
2012, would you expect Chinese log and lumber imports to be kind of up year-over-year or down or sort of roughly
flattish? Or how should we think about that?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: At this point, I don't think we have enough visibility, Anthony, regarding the second half. All
of our intelligence suggests that it should be picking up the second half. 2011 was such a strong year in terms of
exports to China. I would be surprised if our volume would for the full-year be equivalent to what it was in 2011. But I
really can't speculate.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay, okay, that's helpful. And you talked about other export markets or cultivating markets
outside of Japan, China, Korea. Can you talk a little bit about that or give some color there? I know that some of your
competitors have maybe talked about exporting out of the South into the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Do you
have – do you have plans there or is there any kind of opportunity that you can give us details on?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I don't have specifics that would provide a lot of guidance for you. We are exploring
opportunities for other markets in Asia, both off the West Coast and to some extent, out of the South. We are engaged
in some initial activity in shipments into the Mediterranean from the U.S. South. And not only for logs, but to a limited
extent, for lumber. And so we are exploring opportunities, both in the West and the South.
We've never been really an exporter out of the South, or very limited, but we are finding some opportunity given that
we are growing high quality saw logs and Southern Yellow Pine. And given the size and the nature of the clear wood in
those logs, they become attractive for some other markets. And so not enough specific to give much help, but we are –
in fact, we've got some pilot activity both other countries in Asia as well as in Europe.

Do you have a longer-term view on the opportunity? Like could it be a 10 billion square foot – or sorry – yeah, board
foot market on a sustainable basis maybe in five years or so?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I can't speculate. We do see growing demand. They have – if you just look at their GDP, they
are going to need fiber for a lot of purposes. The big breakthrough for China would be if we started to see some
increased activity in wood frame construction. The Canadian Wood Products Council has been leading that initiative

for some period of time and that would be very significant if that were to occur.
We expect the activity to increase over time. They also pull the logs from New Zealand, Russia, we talked about at lot,
it's a question. But the West Coast is very well situated to supply China and we would expect that, given the growth
over time, it'll become a more significant market for all of us in North America.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: Okay, thanks. And then switching gears, it occurs to me that multi-family residential is going
to lead the housing recovery, not just because of government mandates. So are you in a position to build multi-family
yourself? Or do you sell the land to builders with more expertise in that area?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Multi-family is a broad category. So it captures attached housing generally, some of which is
for sale and some of which is rental. So we build a limited amount of multi-family in primarily townhouse structures.
We've always been active in the Washington D.C. market, for instance, in Maryland and Virginia we build townhouse.
We have the ability to build multi-family, we've done it in the past, we are not an apartment developer.
But we have the ability and have in the past built for-sale attached housing, that would be low-rise. Generally, when we
have a land in a master plan community for multi-family, we sell it to a multi-family developer. So when we report
land sales, in some cases we had some last year, we're selling to apartment developers. For our business model, we
prefer for-sale housing rather than rental and so that would be a significant change for us to jump into that business.
Actually, I'm more bullish on single-family starting to show some recovery.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: Well, I hope you're right. And then final quickie, you referred to TJIs a couple of times, Dan,
as opposed to iLevel. So is this the reversal in the brand strategy or are you just calling them what the market calls
them?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: That's a strategy that we reversed last year. So we had been going to market under the
umbrella of iLevel for all of our wood products. And last year we made the determination to revert to our strongest
brand, which is Weyerhaeuser and the TrusJoist brand. In the marketplace everyone calls them TJIs, and they're not
ours probably.
It is a – I think we've got the leading brand in the business and we're building on that and taking advantage of it. So
we're going to market under the Weyerhaeuser name and other the TrusJoist name because we believe that's our
strength and that's the reputation and quite frankly, our customers tell us that that's what they prefer.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: I think that's true. I think TJIs are like Kleenex and Xerox, that's what people call them. Okay,

<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. Pulp maintenance expense, if you could just tell us what it was in the first
quarter? And I think you said it would be fairly similar in the second quarter and then does it pretty much go away in
the third and fourth quarters for this year?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: We'll have a similar amount of maintenance in terms of cost compared to the first quarter,
with the exception of a couple of the mills, one which had in their maintenance shut that carried over into the second
quarter for a day or two. And then one of our mills we're actually finishing up some power boiler expense. So the mill
is up and running, but we're finishing up the maintenance there.
So I would expect that quarter-over-quarter, we'll be up in maintenance somewhere around $5 million to $10 million,
probably closer to $5 million when you look at quarter-over-quarter. In terms of the total maintenance in the first

quarter for Cellulose Fibers, I think we were somewhere around low $20 million for maintenance costs and then you
have to add on top of that the lost productivity, a little bit of additional chemicals, et cetera. I don't have the exact
number for that, Mark.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay. And then do you have any maintenance scheduled for the second half of the year?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: We'll have a similar amount of maintenance in the second quarter and we had two mills
down in the first. So about similar in the second quarter to the first quarter. So we'll have some maintenance, but it will
be much less in the second half. Most of it will be done in the first half.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Hi, Josh.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Can you talk a little bit more about your pulp mill capital projects to get the maintenance
downtime a little bit more extended? I know you said that was a reason for some more prolonged shutdowns this year.
Is that actually anticipated to be completed by the end of the year and 2013 will have that extended maintenance
schedule or is that more of a 2014 event?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The transition to that extended schedule will take place over, likely, a two-year to three-year
period. The scheduled annual maintenance that we have today is not focused on that transition; it is normal
maintenance that we need to do for the safety and longevity of our equipment. But we are taking advantage of those
annual shutdowns in order to make some incremental changes and improvements that would allow us to accomplish
these transitions. So it'll be a two-year to three-year period.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Okay. And you mentioned in your prepared comments that you had seen volumes picking up
and Japan might be a little bit weaker in the second quarter. Was that just the Japanese economy getting a little bit
better or is that a post-earthquake rebuild or maybe some combination of the two? Thanks.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, as it relates to what's happening in Japan, we saw an increasing amount of activity late
in the year and the first quarter was relatively steady. We expect Japan to maintain, perhaps pick up a bit. We're not
seeing any significant earthquake rebuild activity that's driving increased volumes. Some of that may be happening, but
it's not obvious to us. We anticipated that the rebuild would take some period of time because of the need to initially
rebuild infrastructure.
The initial response in Japan was focused on temporary housing. That's been accomplished, that was mostly modular
and there was some amount of wood product involved in that, but not significant amounts. The areas that were most
hard hit by the Tsunami and the earthquake were rural and not heavily populated. And so most of the rebuild activity
will be longer term and we will – we expect not to see anything like we did, Josh, in response to the Kobe earthquake,
which was a heavily urbanized area and a lot of rebuilding had to take place over a two-year to three-year period. So
I'm sure it adds some incremental volume over time, but it's not terribly significant.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Josh, just to be clear, in terms of the second quarter outlook, we said that volumes would
be pretty much flat, it's just the realization we said that might soften somewhat. And that's really more of a currency
statement in terms of competitive pressures from European supply because of the weaker euro. So our volumes to
Japan should be very stable in the second quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Yeah, thanks very much. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a follow-up on the earlier
question on price declines in your backlogs of WRECO. That's sort of consistent with sort of smaller home sizing,
lower percentage of single-family houses and sort of, I guess, less bells and whistles on houses overall. The question is
do you see that as a cyclical or a structural shift in the market?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The mix shift that we're seeing is primarily related to geography, Paul. We've been through a
period where over the last two years to three years we had some decline in square footage. And certainly, a lot of the
upgrades have disappeared from these homes. But interestingly, in a market by market basis, we're seeing some
increased activity in higher priced homes. So in Phoenix, where we've had terrific sales, we are not a first-time buyer
product there. We sell first-time move up, second-time move up. In the Puget Sound area, our quadrant operation has
actually moved its price point up and is providing really a higher-quality more amenitized house than they were four
years or five years ago.
Our most recent openings in Las Vegas have been higher priced homes, four car garage, price range $350,000 to
$400,000 plus or minus. So that's not to say that's happening everywhere. But in our own mix, the primary factor ends
up being where that house is and where the sales are occurring as we start to look at the relative percentage of where
our sales are coming from or where the closings are coming from in any one period. We've seen that shift. And so plus
or minus 5% of total closings we saw on a quarter-over-quarter basis the percentage of our closings drop 5% and San
Diego went up 5% and Phoenix.
And those kinds of shifts will be enough to throw off the weighted average of either margin or price. So it gets a little
bit complicated to have a broad brush explanation for what's going on. We are not seeing a rush to the bottom in terms
of the price or removing amenities. In fact, I think what's happening now is there have been a lot of foreclosed houses
on the market. People that are coming into new home sales offices are looking for a home that are more customized,
that probably with more features and it meets their needs much more closely than trying to buy a foreclosed house
either from a banker or an auction. And we view that as being very positive.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Wow, pretty interesting answer. Just a last question on housing and your leverage there. If I take
a look at housing stats, they're sort of down 8.1% annually over the last five years. Wooden starts held up a lot better
and are down 3.5%. Are you guys taking market share with your sort of growing export to Japan?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Can you restate the question? I don't think I understood.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Okay. If I look at Japanese housing starts, I see a downtrend over the last five years. I would
say, wooden starts has held up a lot better. Your business seems to be holding pretty steady. That suggests that you're
taking market share. Have I got that right?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I believe our customers are taking market share.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Well, fair enough. That's all about I have.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: As you think about who we export to, Paul, we're exporting – most of our product is
export of logs, and certainly our customers in Japan, especially our largest customer, is taking market share.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Okay. Thank you. Dan?
