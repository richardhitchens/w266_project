Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us.
We're pleased to report the results of our fourth fiscal quarter. We established new September quarter records for
iPhone, iPad and Mac unit sales leading to our highest September quarter revenue and earnings ever.
Revenue for the quarter was $36 billion representing year-over-year growth of 27%. That's a $7.7 billion increase over
the prior September quarter's result and was driven primarily by strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales.
Operating margin was $10.9 billion, representing 30.4% of revenue. Net income was $8.2 billion increasing 24% over
the prior September quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to diluted earnings per share of $8.67.
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We sold over 4.9 million
Macs, establishing a new September quarter record. This represents 1% growth year-over-year compared to IDC's latest
published estimate of an 8% contraction of the global personal computer market in the September quarter.
Portable sales grew 9% year-over-year and represented an all-time high of 80% of Mac unit mix thanks to strong sales
of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. Earlier this week we unveiled a stunning new design for iMac that packs high
performance technology and a brilliant new display with reduced reflection into an incredibly sleek aluminum and glass
enclosure. We also introduced an even thinner and lighter version of our most popular Mac, the 13-inch MacBook Pro,
featuring a Retina display with over 4 million pixels and all flash storage. We began and ended the quarter with
between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory which is below our target range of four to five weeks.
Moving to our music products we sold 5.3 million iPods compared to 6.6 million in the year ago quarter. iPod touch
continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the
September quarter based on the latest data published by NPD and iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in
most countries we track, based on the latest data published by GfK.
We're very excited to be shipping our newest iPods as of two weeks ago. The new iPod touch is the thinnest iPod touch
yet. It comes in five great colors and features a 4-inch Retina display, a 5 megapixel iSight camera, our powerful A5
chip and Siri. The new iPod nano is the thinnest iPod ever featuring a 2.5-inch Multi-Touch display, convenient
navigation buttons and built-in Bluetooth for wireless listening. The nano comes in seven great new colors and we
think our full range of iPods will make wonderful gifts this holiday season.
The iTunes store generated all-time record results with revenue almost $2.1 billion thanks to continued strong sales of
music, apps and video. We look forward to launching the new iTunes featuring a completely redesigned player,
seamless integration with iCloud and a new look for the iTunes store. The new iTunes has a dramatically simpler and
cleaner interface so customers' music, movie and TV purchases on any of their iOS devices or computers are
conveniently displayed in their iTunes library and are available whenever they want them.
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We're very pleased to have sold 26.9 million iPhones compared to 17.1 million in the
previous September quarter. That represents 58% year-over-year growth compared to IDC's latest published estimate of
45% growth for the smartphone market overall during the quarter.
We launched iPhone 5 in nine countries on September 21 and 22 more countries on September 28 and demand has been
phenomena. Customers have responded tremendously to the iPhone 5's all new thin and light designs and beautiful new
4-inch Retina display, the powerful performance of the A6 chip and the great new ultra-fast wireless technology.
Demand for iPhone 5 continues to outstrip supply, and we're working hard to get more into customers' hands as quickly
as possible.
We ended the quarter with about 9.1 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 800,000
iPhones and ended the quarter below our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory, on a look
forward basis.

Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $17.1 billion during the quarter, compared to $11
billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 56%. Businesses around the world continue to make iPhone an essential
device for their employees. Virtually every type of enterprise and small business is using iPhone along with the
business apps from the App Store and custom apps developed in-house to drive efficiencies that were simply not
possible before.
Cannon has provided its field force team iPhones with secure access to its customer relationship management system.
Sales reps can now access customer information and input meeting notes anywhere, giving them more time with
customers.
Amtrak has deployed thousands of iPhones to train conductors. They use an in-house app that changes the entire
ticketing and reporting work flow. The app enables printed home ticket validation, delivers a more accurate passenger
manifest, and makes accounting data available to Amtrak's revenue systems in near real time, revolutionizing the paper
based process the company used in the past.
And news organizations around the world are using the iPhone to transform the way they capture and deliver news.
Reporters for BBC, the Wall Street Journal, Mexican newspaper, Milenio and Canada's CTV news are using their
iPhone cameras to capture HD video on location and send it directly back to headquarters for broadcast on TV or
streaming on the web.
Turning to iPad, we were pleased with sales of 14 million iPads during the September quarter compared to 11.1 million
in the year ago quarter, an increase of 26%. iPad sales were ahead of our expectations and we saw strong
year-over-year growth in iPad sales in every geographic region.
Earlier this week we introduced the iPad mini, the thinnest, lightest, smallest iPad we've ever built. It has all the power,
performance and capability customers have come to expect from an iPad and you can hold it in one hand. We also
introduced the 4th generation iPad with a beautiful 9.7-inch Retina display and A6 chip with twice the performance of
the iPad we announced earlier this year. Together with the iPad 2, these two new iPads run more than 275,000 Apps in
the App Store. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $7.5 billion
compared to $6.9 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 9%.
We ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 200,000, which
left us just over our four weeks of iPad channel inventory target on a look-back basis. iPad is fundamentally changing
work processes across industries around the world. With apps developed in-house, iPad is helping companies deliver
better service, streamline manufacturing and empower workforces with critical data and information.
Volkswagen has developed more than 30 in-house apps for vital processes across the company including monitoring
and tracking of vehicles on the production line, scheduling of vehicle transportation at assembly plants and greeting
customers when they pick up new cars.
Ping An Insurance in China has deployed thousands of iPads to their sales agents and service teams. Apps developed
in-house are used by car accident inspectors to carry out on site inspections and file claims, which significantly
shortens processing time and improves customer satisfaction.
And Brazil's Banco Bradesco is using iPads to redefine the customer experience in their bank branches. Beyond
completing customer transactions, employees use iPads to inform and educate customers about bank services and
Bradesco apps in the App Store.
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we sold over 44 million iOS devices in the September quarter. The App Store
now offers more than 700,000 apps including over 275,000 apps specifically for iPad. We established a new all-time
record for quarterly app sales in the September quarter and we were very pleased to report that we've reached $6.5
billion in cumulative payments to developers.
Customers are embracing iCloud in growing numbers with over 190 million account signups in the first year of the
service. With iCloud, customers can access their music, photos, calendars, contacts, documents and more from
whatever device they're using. And it's built into every new iOS device and every new Mac.

And we launched iOS 6 last month and it's already on over 200 million devices. iOS 6 includes over 200 new features
including broader language support for Siri, Facebook integration, shared photo streams and more. We've made a
number of improvements to Maps over the past month and we will work nonstop until Maps lives up to our incredibly
high standards.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue was $4.2 billion, which is a new September quarter record and
an increase of 18% over the year ago quarter, with growth fueled primarily by the Stores' best iPhone launch ever. The
Stores also established a new quarterly record for Mac sales, selling just over 1.1 million Macs. We opened a total of 18
new Stores in 10 countries during the quarter including our first Store in Sweden. We also opened our second Store in
Hong Kong at Festival Walk to overwhelming response resulting in our biggest store opening of the year. We exited
the quarter with 390 Stores, 140 of which are outside the United States.
With an average of 376 Stores open, average revenue per Store was $11.2 million compared to $10.7 million in the
year ago quarter. Segment margin was $848 million compared to $652 million in the year ago quarter. We hosted 94
million visitors to our Stores during the quarter, compared to 77.5 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of
22%. That translates to an average of 19,000 visitors per Store per week.
Total company gross margin was 40%, which was 150 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference
was due to better than expected commodity and other costs. Another quarter of the difference was due to leverage on
the higher than expected sales and more favorable foreign exchange. The remainder was due to some items that we do
not expect to recur in the December quarter.
Operating expenses were $3.5 billion and included $379 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was a net
expense of $51 million. Interest income and investment gains were more than offset by higher than expected currency
hedging expense. Under the accounting rules foreign exchange fluctuations late in the quarter required us to accelerate
recognition of premium expense related to Q1 and Q2 hedges. This will result in less premium expense being
recognized in Q1 and Q2.
The tax rate for the quarter was 24.5% bringing us to a tax rate for the full fiscal year of 25.2%.
Turning to cash, our cash plus short term and long term marketable securities totaled $121.3 billion at the end of the
September quarter, compared to $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of over $4 billion.
The increase in cash was net of $2.5 billion of dividends paid in August. About $83 billion of our total cash was
offshore at the end of the September quarter.
Cash flow from operations was $9.1 billion. Our board of directors has declared a dividend of $2.65 per common share
payable on November 15, 2012 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 12, 2012.
In August we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 compliant accelerated share repurchase program with a financial institution to
purchase up to $2 billion of Apple stock during fiscal year 2013. In addition to shares purchased through the
accelerated share repurchase program, we may also purchase shares in open market transactions in compliance with all
applicable securities laws.
As we move ahead into the December quarter I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of
forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
As a reminder, year-over-year comparisons will be impacted by the fact that our December quarter this year will span
13-weeks whereas the December quarter last year included a 14th week. As we indicated previously, revenue in that
14th week last year was approximately 1/14 of the quarter's total revenue.
We expect revenue to be about $52 billion compared to $46.3 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect
gross margin to be about 36% reflecting approximately $90 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We
expect OpEx to be about $4.05 billion, including about $485 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We
expect OI&E to be about $380 million and we expect tax rate to be about 26%. We are targeting EPS of about $11.75.

In closing, we're extremely proud to have concluded an amazing fiscal year 2012. We generated revenue of over $156
billion, which is up 45% year-over-year, and reflects growth of $48 billion in revenue.
We sold over 200 million iOS devices, including 125 million iPhones reflecting 73% growth year-over-year, and 58
million iPads, reflecting 80% growth. We sold a record 18 million Macs and shipped 35 million iPods and we
expanded the reach of iTunes music stores to 63 countries around the world.
We launched stunning new versions of OS X and iOS and tying it all together, we launched iCloud with customers
reaching over 190 million and growing.
And finally, we generated net income of $41.7 billion, an increase of 61% year-over-year. We enter this holiday season
with our strongest product lineup ever and we remain very confident in our new product pipeline.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton
Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the
first question please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Good afternoon. If your guidance comes to fruition, December will be the first quarter
in a very long time that Apple EPS declined year-on-year despite what has been the broadest product refresh in the
company's history over the past two months. The bears will point out that maybe the company's price premium or
supply chain advantage is weakening. So just curious how you would respond to that?
Then as a follow-up, Peter, if you can comment on what's driving the significant gross margin downtick in December,
given you should have decent iPhone mix? Thank you.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. Katy, let me begin. I'll address many of the things you asked and then Tim can add a
few points. The change year-over-year is being driven by a couple of things. So first of all, last year included a 14th
week. This year's Q1 is a normal 13-week quarter, that along with a stronger U.S. dollar and the change in gross
margin.
So let me talk to you about what we see for gross margins. But I'm going to go through some detail on a sequential
basis, not year-over-year. As you pointed out, this is the most prolific product period in Apple's history. We have an
unprecedented number of new product introductions over the last six weeks and this has led to record levels of demand.
New or repriced versions of our products announced during this timeframe represent over 80% of the total expected
December quarter revenue, but there are costs associated with such dramatic change and demand.
The iPhone 5, iPad mini, iMac, MacBook Pro 13-inch, iPod touch and iPod nano have completely new form factors
with great new features and we've never before introduced so many new form factors at once. All of these products
have higher costs than their predecessors and therefore lower gross margins as they are at the height of the cost curve.
This has been the case with new products in the past, so nothing new. The difference this time is the sheer number of
new products we are introducing in the very short period of time.
Additionally, we lowered the price of the iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 delivering incredible value to our customers. We
head into this holiday quarter with the strongest iPhone lineup that we have ever had with the iPhone 4 starting at free
in the subsidized markets.

We also added the iPad mini to our iPad lineup. The iPad mini has the full iPad experience and we priced it
aggressively at $329, delivering incredible value to our customers. Its gross margin is significantly below the corporate
average.
So in summary, we expect our gross margin to decline by about 400 basis points sequentially. We expect the benefit
from positive leverage on the sequentially higher revenue and a greater mix of iPhones but we expect these benefits
will be more than offset by a number of factors.
First, margins on new products are lower than their predecessors including the iPhone 5 and we have been aggressive
with the iPad mini.
Second, we've lowered the price of the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 4.
Third, we will experience transitionary costs associated with multiple new product ramps.
Fourth, the high anticipated volume of iPhone and other new products will generate significantly greater deferred
revenue sequentially. As you're aware, we defer a portion of our revenue with every device we sell and amortize it back
into revenue over the life of the device. In periods of exceptionally strong sales, like the December quarter, the deferred
amounts are significantly higher than the revenue amortized in from past sales.
And fifth, the favorable items that benefited the gross margin in the September quarter are not expected to repeat in the
December quarter.
We will work hard to try and get down the cost curves and improve our manufacturing and other efficiencies as we
have successfully done in the past. We enter this holiday season with our strongest product lineup ever and we have
great choices for customers. To be in the position to anticipate over $50 billion of demand for our products in a single
quarter is a reflection of the incredible strength of our products and our business.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Katy, if I can just add a couple things to that. We're dedicated to making the very best
products in the world. We think about the smallest of details. And we're unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best
customer experience in the world. It's this relentless commitment to innovation and excellence is the reason that our
customers choose to buy our products. And this will always be the driving force behind Apple. We're managing the
company for the long run and we'll continue to make great long-term decisions. We remain very, very confident in our
strategy and we'll use our world class skills and hardware, software and services to delight our customers.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks for the detail.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks Katy. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Bill Shope.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. Can you walk through how you're thinking about the supply ramp for the
iPhone 5 in the holiday quarter? And how does some of the challenges you're facing relative to the strong demand
compare to past iOS product launches?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, hi, Bill. It's Tim. The demand for iPhone is extremely robust. We're thrilled with what
we see. We are in a significant state of backlog right now. In terms of the production, our output has improved
significantly since earlier this month and I'm very, very pleased with the progress that we've made there. I'm pleased
with the current level of output in what is the largest volume ramp in Apple's history. It's difficult to predict when
supply and demand will balance. But I'm feeling very confident on our ability to supply quite a few iPhones.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question, please?

Next we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to first follow up on that previous question around the ramp
of iPhones. Do you continue to anticipate rolling out to all 100 countries this quarter as you had announced at the time
of the iPhone 5 announcement? And related to that, can you comment on whether the supply constraints that you've had
have had a material impact on your cost of goods sold relative – so as your supply improves, do you actually expect
your cost of goods sold to decline?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Tony, it's Tim. In regard to your first question, we still continue to anticipate rolling out to
the 100 countries as we announced before. It is our fastest rollout ever. There will be some large countries in the month
of December but we anticipate still achieving the 100.
In terms of costs, with each new product we see learning curves associated with ramping production and the new
products we have now are no exception to that. The difference is the number of new products that we have moving at
once. As Peter said, and as you can tell from the announcements we've had the last couple months, this is the most
prolific period in our history in terms of the new product introduction and innovation. The past six weeks have been
phenomenal in terms of new product introduction. And so we do see all of these costs associated with each of these, but
I don't see those costs accelerating on a per unit basis as we go through the quarter. I see it very much being a
production ramp across many, many new products.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. Thank you for that color. If I could just follow-up. You've talked before about how
you believe that the iPad will be – and the tablet market will be an enormous market, bigger than the PC market.
Clearly you've made a move to expand that market and make it more accessible by introducing the iPad mini. I'm
wondering if over time you could see this market evolving to larger tablets going forward that would address different
needs in the marketplace, take on incremental PC functionality? And I'm wondering when you talk about the iPad
market being bigger than the PC market going toward, do you see larger form factors in the marketplace evolving? And
I guess the question is, why not?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Toni, as you know, we don't comment on our future views on products and roadmaps,
etcetera. But let me make some comments on your question. We continue to be very confident that the tablet market
will surpass the PC market. There is incredible development in the ecosystems and product going on in the tablet space.
It is already extremely compelling for many, many customers to choose a tablet, in particular, an iPad over a PC. And
when you look at the size of the PC market, there is an enormous opportunity for Apple there. Pretty much each quarter
you see 80 million to 90 million PCs being sold.
And so we do think that the iPad and the iPad Mini and the iPad 2 will all be extremely attractive offerings for people
in lieu of PCs. And we're going to continue to very much focus on the future of iPad, and we're very, very confident
with what we have in the pipeline. And we're extremely pleased to have launched iPad mini and can't wait until next
Friday when we begin selling the very first units.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Toni.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Tim or Peter, could you talk a little bit about China and what you're
seeing in China? Clearly with your revenue guidance, it sounds like it remains strong. But, obviously, there's been
some mixed signals from an economic standpoint.

<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, Shannon. It's Tim. In terms of what we saw in China for Q4, revenue was $5.7 billion,
that's up 26% year-on-year. Mac was up extremely strong, up 44%. As you recall, we launched portables for the first
time in July – portables that we had previously announced in the U.S. in June. We announced it in China in July. iPad
was up 45% in greater China. iPhone was up 38%, and so all in all, a fantastic quarter.
That brings us to a full year, fiscal year revenue number of $23.8 billion for China, which is really phenomenal when
you think about it. That's up over $10 billion year-on-year, up 78%. And Greater China now represents about 15% of
Apple for the fiscal year. And so we're extremely happy with how we've done in China. As Peter alluded to in his
opening remarks, we are continuing to invest in our own retail stores there. We continue to expand distribution with
channel partners as well. And we continue to see it as a extremely exciting market with more and more people wanting
Apple products.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. And then I just had a follow-up question on the tablet market. With the launch of
Surface today and obviously the Win 8 tablets and that, could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a
competitive standpoint and how you think about it? Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I haven't personally played with a Surface yet. But what we're reading about it is that it's a
fairly compromised, confusing product. And so I think one of the toughest things you do with deciding which product
is to make hard tradeoffs and decide what a product should be and we've rally done that with the iPad. And so the user
experience is absolutely incredible. I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I don't think it would do
all of those things very well. And so I think people, when they look at the iPad versus competitive offerings, are going
to conclude they really want an iPad. And I think people have done that to date and think they'll continue to do that.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?

From Barclays we'll go to Ben Reitzes.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Can you just go through a little bit more on tablets? The
iPad mini, how do you think that will sell versus the original iPad form factor? And how do you want to differentiate
that? Is there more of e-book focus with, an education focus with the mini? And do you think it'll sell more than the
regular or the original iPad? And how do you want us to just think about the cannibalization factor as well of the older
product or the older form factor?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We don't really have an old product, Ben. We have only new products. We just announced a
fourth generation iPad as well.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah, I knew I'd mess up in my speech there. I'm sorry.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: [Laughter]. So – no, but the way that we look at this is that we provide a fantastic iPod
touch. We provide an incredible 4th generation iPad, an iPad mini and an iPad 2. Customers will decide which one or
two or three or all four that they would like and will buy those. And so we've learned over the years not to worry about
cannibalization of our own products. It's much better for us to do that than somebody else to do it. And the far, far
bigger opportunity here are the 80 million to 90 million PCs that are being sold per quarter.
There's still over 300 million PCs being bought per year. And I think a great number of those people would be much
better off buying an iPad or a Mac. And so that's the much bigger opportunity for Apple. And so instead of being
focused on cannibalizing ourselves, I look at it much more that it's an enormous incremental opportunity for us. So
that's how I'd look at it.

<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. And then just my quick follow-up is on Apple TV. We haven't heard about your
hobby in a while. How many did you sell in the quarter? And what's the strategy there for the living room to date? And
I'm intrigued to hear the answer or not an answer.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Or not you might guess. For Q4 we sold 1.3 million. That's up over 100% year-on-year. That
means that we sold up more than 5 million Apple TVs during the fiscal year which is almost double the previous year.
We'd sold 2.8 the previous year. And so the business continues to do very well, but if you look at the size revenue of
this business versus our other businesses, it's quite small. And so it still has the hobby label. However, it's a beloved
hobby. And we continue to focus on it and continue to believe there's something more there and continue to pull the
strings and see where it takes us.

Moving on, we'll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Hey. Good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about the iPad? We saw a deceleration in
the September quarter. Was there anything in particular that might have been, as you think about that business, might
have been driving that?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: The June to September was 17 million to 14 million, Gene. The thing to – the first thing to
note there is that, as we talked about in the July call, the June quarter contained 1.2 million increase in channel
inventory. And so the actual sell through sequentially – comparison looks very different than our reported sell-in
numbers do.
The second thing is that the 14 million exceeded what we had expected to do in iPad. And the reason we had expected
it to decline is that we believed based on the two or three years of results that we've got is that normally we would see a
seasonal reduction in the September quarter versus the June quarter. Part of this reason is because K-12 heavily buys in
the June quarter. K-12 doesn't buy very much in the September quarter. It becomes a higher ed kind of move and higher
ed is still buying notebooks for the most part.
So there's some kind of normal seasonal. That's exaggerated further when we announce a new product in March and
have an enormous full quarter of demand in the June quarter. And then when you compare that to the September
quarter there would be a natural phase down. In addition to all of that, people – it's clear that customers delayed
purchases of tablets due to new product rumors and these intensified in August and September. Some of that was
anticipated and some of it I wish wouldn't occur, but it did occur. And so that's how I would explain the sequential
difference.
On a year-over-year basis, because of the year ago quarter having also a channel-inventory build as we stocked the
channel to the proper level, the sell-through year-over-year actually grew 44%. And so the underlying sell-through was
extremely strong. And so we continue to feel great about how iPad has done. And with announcing the fourth
generation iPad just this week and adding iPad mini to the family, we think it's going be an incredible holiday season.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Okay, great. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is given what we're seeing in
margins, as some of these products get more expensive to produce to be competitive, would you be open to passing
some of those costs on to your customers? And obviously historically you've announced new products and maintained a
lot of those price points.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: It's a hypothetical question. And so we think we've made great choices on both products and
the prices. As you know, our customary practice, our long-standing customary practice is just to guide for the current

From JPMorgan we'll go to Mark Moskowitz.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon. Peter or Tim, my first question's around the sequential
guidance for revenue of around 44% quarter-on-quarter for December. Can you provide some us context to how we
should think about the iPad and the iPhone families in particular? How their revenue growth could dovetail with that
44%?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Hi, Mark. It's Peter. You're asking the sequential question but I do want to just remind
everybody that if you're looking at this year-over-year and comparing the sequentials year-over-year, don't forget about
the 14th week last year in Q1. You need to adjust for that. And I think it would give you a different answer if you were
comparing anything year-over-year.
Specific to your question on iPhone and iPad sequentially, we have just announced amazing new products in both
lineups. And we expect large sequential increases going from the September to December quarter and as a result, we're
thrilled to be providing guidance tonight for $52 billion of revenue.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay and then, Tim, a question on the iPhone 5. As far as just the global roll-out, what is
the approach? Is the approach to first touch all 100 countries and have supply constraints impacting all 100 countries
first and then go back and back-fill all of those different outlets? Or will there be certain markets where you decide to
kind of reach supply-demand equilibrium first and then keep some of those other 100 countries at the constrained
levels? Just kind of curious about the effort there in terms of are you going try to first sprinkle product everywhere and
then back-fill later? Or will it be more targeted?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: What we did initially, Mark, was we planned the first 30 to 40 countries prior to introducing
the product and rolled those out across September in two different dates. The balance of the quarter, we planned with
an eye toward the supply and what we think the demand will be. But, yeah, we do plan these in advance. And so it is
not a precise science. And we obviously have to plan those with several weeks of notice. So occasionally it can be
different than what we think.

<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you very much. Regarding the iPad, you said that you priced it very
aggressively. I think many people on the Street seem to have a slightly different view. Could you maybe talk a little bit
about your pricing philosophy? Was it driven by cost? Or is it just more to keep a premium brand given the quality of
your products?

<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Steve, it's Peter. When we set out to build the iPad mini, we didn't set out to build a small,
cheap tablet. We set out to build a smaller iPad that offered the full iPad experience as our customers would expect. As
a result, the difference between the iPad mini and the competition is profound. Our iPad mini begins with a 7.9-inch
display which is 35% larger than 7-inch tablets, providing a much better experience.
We are shipping two great cameras, FaceTime HD front and a 5 megapixel 1080p iSight rear camera versus typically
one from our competition. We are shipping our fastest communications with dual bank Wi-Fi and included the A5 chip
which has higher performance than our competitors. And finally the fit and finish of our precision unibody aluminum
enclosure is breathtaking when held in your hands. And so that's what we've done.
The iPad mini has a higher cost and the gross margin is significantly below our corporate average. We're beginning at
the height of the cost curve, but in addition to wanting to make a large number, we're going to work to try and get down
the cost curves and be more efficient in manufacturing as we have been in the past with our other products.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Steve, it's Tim. One of the things we try to do is to create a product that people will love for
months and years after they've purchased it and continue using it in a robust way. So that's what iPad mini has been
designed to do. And you can really see that more broadly on iPad but looking at the usage statistics. As I'd mentioned
earlier this week, over 90% of the web traffic from tablets are from iPads.
And so Apple will not make a product that somebody may feel good about for the moment that they're paying for it and
when they get it home, they rarely ever use it again. That's not what we're about. It's not the kind of experience we want
our customers to have. And I think when you – I would encourage you to use an iPad mini and I don't think you'll be
using anything other than maybe another iPad or something after you do that.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: I look forward to it. Could you comment on your enterprise opportunity? Obviously a
lot of it's BYOD but you have many retailers who have a corporate directive to use iPads and so forth. Are you doing
anything a little bit more aggressive to support that market, particularly with the Windows pads now coming out?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We now have almost all of the Fortune 500 that are testing or deploying iPad and I think
with the recent announcements, penetration will only grow. We've also pushed fairly aggressively in the Global 500
and so those numbers now are above 80% on both iPhone and iPad. And so I feel like we're doing fairly well there.
There's clearly much more to do but I'm feeling pretty good about it.

<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks Steve. Can we have the next question, please?

From Bank of America Merrill Lynch we'll hear from Scott Craig.
<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, Tim, can you maybe comment on the component
environment a little bit, particularly related to iPad, iPad mini and iPhone and just where you see some of the
constraints perhaps here as you're launching?
And then, Peter, just a quick one for you, the volatility on the OI&E line, is that just a calendar third quarter and
calendar fourth quarter issue and then it normalizes or is that going to continue? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Scott, it's Tim. In terms of iPad and iPhone, I don't see a component shortage gating us for
the quarter in the numbers that we've given you in the guidance. I think we've solved some challenges there and feel
good about our position.
In terms of general shortages, on the iMac, we'll be constrained for the full quarter in a significant way. Part of that is
that we're beginning shipping the 21.5-inch iMac in November and the 27-inch in December. So there will be a short
amount of time during the quarter to manufacture and ramp those and I expect the demand to be robust. So we will

have a significant shortage there.
The others are more based on how big is big from a demand point-of-view. And that is very difficult to predict. But you
can tell that we're extremely bullish on the demand with the revenue guidance that Peter talked about earlier. Hopefully
that answers your question.
<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Yes. Thanks.
<A - Gary Wipfler>: Hey, Scott. This is Gary. I'll take the OI&E question. Hey, I'll expand on Peter's remarks just a
little bit. While interest income was about what we expected, foreign-exchange hedging expense was higher than we
expected relative to our guidance. Without getting overly detailed, dollar weakness late in the quarter and accounting
rules required us to accelerate and recognize a large amount of foreign-exchange premium expense related to future
quarter hedges in the current quarter. All things being equal, premium expense in Q1 should be lower. This has been
factored into our December OI&E guidance of $380 million.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Gary, and thanks, Scott. Can we have the next question, please?

From ISI group we'll hear from Brian Marshall.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys. If you look at the iPhone unit growth versus the revenue growth, that's
been a pretty similar dynamic over the past several quarters. But when you look at that same dynamic for the iPad, it's
actually started to break down slightly over the past couple quarters. In fact in this most recent quarter, it looks like
revenues grew three times faster than the unit growth. So I guess the question is, is this just simply the market
migrating down to the sort of low end of the SKU stack? Or is this less accessories from an attach or dollar spend? And
then I had a quick follow-up.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Brian, it's Peter. I didn't quite follow your three times, but the iPhone ASPs were relatively
flat in the September quarter year-on-year and were up slightly on a sequential basis. The iPad ASPs were down
year-over-year in a low double-digit way. But this really was reflective of our price reduction on the iPad 2, the
stronger dollar, and a little bit of change in mix and that's what drove the ASP change year-over-year. On a sequential
basis, iPad ASPs were actually pretty flat.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great, thanks. And then my quick follow-up is it looks like this is the second quarter in a row
that the United States iPhone activations have actually grown faster than the international market. And that kind of
seems like a strange dynamic considering the magnitude of the TAM of the international being an order magnitude
larger than the U.S. I was wondering if you could comment on that? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think it's important to remember there that we launched iPhone 5 in the U.S. during the
quarter and where we launched in some international countries, the bulk of the world, we did not launch in. And so I
would have expected to have seen more significant growth in the U.S. versus the rest of the world.

will be able to meet supply of iPhones at the end of the December quarter or do you think you will end the quarter with
backlog of iPhone 5s? Or iPhones I should just say as a product category?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I'm actually not projecting whether supply and demand will balance for the quarter. I'm
saying that I feel great about where we are on the manufacturing ramp. That our supply output is significantly higher
than it was earlier in October. And I'm confident that we'll be able to supply quite a few during the quarter, but in terms
of when that balance occurs, I can't tell at this point.

From Deutsche Bank we'll go to Chris Whitmore.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Thanks very much. Tim, I wanted to go back to the iPad one more time if I could.
Specifically, I wanted to ask or try to get a feel for your view around the emerging model in the tablet space where
vendors are willing to subsidize their hardware with content or search, where many of these vendors are selling
hardware at a break even or even a loss and hoping to make it up on the back end. How is that impacting your iPad
business if at all? And is that something Apple would consider going forward?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We've seen low cost challengers before and iPad continues to beat every other tablet on the
market at any price. And so we think customers are very smart. We think they have very high expectations. We think
that they want a device that can do more. And we're confident that our focus on making the best product is what will
win at the end of the day. And so we will stay true to that.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Okay. My second question I wanted to ask about supply. It sounds like you've made a lot
of changes to your supplier list as these new products are ramping, perhaps due to strategic reasons and is that creating
an added layer of complexity as you try to ramp these new products? And to what extent is that contributing perhaps to
the higher cost structure of these products?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I'm not sure what you're trying to get at there, but I would not say that there's been a
significant change in our supplier partners. There's always some change, obviously, but I wouldn't describe any change
as significant. And there hasn't been a change that would have driven more cost, if that's your specific question.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: I was specifically asking about LCD and your Samsung relationship.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: LCD, I wouldn't characterize any change there as having driven any cost and Samsung, we
continue to be a customer of Samsung and continue to have a commercial relationship.

<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. My first question is for Tim. Just in terms of the iPad mini there's obviously
been a fair amount of debate within Apple over the years whether to even do the smaller screen iPad. I guess, can you
speak about what you've learned over the last couple years as to why the time for that now is right or whether the
technology is right? Just any insight there would be helpful.
And then for Peter my question is on gross margins. I just want to revisit it slightly. In the sense that you guys have
spoken about various higher cost structures before as well in the move from the 3GS to the 4 on the iPhone and even
when the iPad was launched. In the end what we've seen is that the scale that Apple are building, the size of revenues
you're getting to, the component reuse has meant that you've actually very quickly got through these potential gross
margin dips. Is anything structurally different this time around? Many thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, on your question about iPad mini. The comments that I think you're referencing are
comments that Steve had made before about 7-inch tablets. And let me be clear, we would not make one of the 7-inch
tablets. We don't think they're good products and we would never make one. Not just because it's 7 inches but for many
reasons. One of the reasons, however, is size.
And so I'm not sure if you saw our keynote, but the difference in just the real estate size between the 7.9 almost 8,
versus 7, is 35%. And when you look at the usable area, it's much greater than that. It's from 50% to 67%. And, also,
the iPad mini has the same number of pixels as iPad 2 does. And so you have access to all 275,000 apps that are in our
App Store that have been custom designed to take advantage of the full canvas. And so iPad mini is a fantastic product.
It's not a compromised product like the 7-inch tablets are. It's in a whole different league.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Kulbinder, the sequential decline in gross margin that we see in the December quarter is
largely being driven by many new form factor changes and some price reductions that we've taken that I went through
in great detail. And we believe that over 80% of the revenue that we will see in the December quarter will come from
product that we've just introduced in the last six weeks.
And so while having lower gross margins on a new product is not something that's new for us, what is different this
time is just the sheer number of new products that we've introduced in the last six weeks and we just have not had that
magnitude in the past. So I don't see something that's structurally different. And we have a big focus on wanting to
make a lot of these products, to get them in customers' hands as quickly as we can, but we are also going to work to try
and get down the cost curves and improve manufacturing and other efficiencies, as we have successfully done in the
past.
So no change in what we're going to try and work on and we'll report to you in January how we did.
