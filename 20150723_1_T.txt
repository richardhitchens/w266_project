Before I turn it over to John, let me cover slide three, cover our consolidated financial summary. Adjusted EPS for the
quarter was $0.69. That's up more than 11% over last year's second quarter. This includes adjustments for a non-cash
charge related to Leap's network decommissioning and other merger-related costs, which include DIRECTV and
Mexico. This strong year-over-year growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexican wireless operations
as well as the impact from our divested Connecticut wireline business and our equity investment in América Móvil.
Consolidated revenues grew to $33 billion. That's up more than 2% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut
wireline property. This growth was driven by continued solid performance in wireless as we reposition our smartphone
base. We had impressive gains in strategic business services and strong wireline consumer revenue growth.
Cash flows also grew significantly in the quarter. Cash from ops for the quarter totaled more than $9 billion, up more
than 13% over last year's second quarter. And free cash flow was $4.5 billion and more than $7 billion on a
year-to-date basis. And that brought our free cash flow dividend payout to 67% on a year-to-date basis.
And so with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens, and he'll
discuss our operational highlights. John?
John J. Stephens
Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. And as always, thanks for your interest in AT&T.
As you can see in our second quarter results, our moves to transform the company are working and working well. We
grew revenues, expanded margins, and achieved double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Cash flows were strong, allowing
us to invest in our business. We returned substantial value to shareholders and strengthened our cash position.
Our moves to reposition our smartphone customer base are working, achieving the expected results. Almost 80% of the
smartphone base is already on Mobile Share Value plans, and 68% of our smartphone sales and upgrades were on
AT&T Next. When you add in the customers who brought their own device, nearly three-quarters of smartphone sales
were without subsidies. This helped drive strong postpaid phone-only with Next ARPU growth and best ever service
margins.
In wireline, our transition is to IP services continues at a strong clip. U-verse services were more than 70% of consumer
revenues and helped drive near 4% adjusted revenue growth. Strategic services are now a third of our wireline business
revenues and continue to grow at a very strong pace.
So all in all, a very strong quarter as we begin the diversification of our company. Our growth in cost initiatives such as
Project VIP and Project Agile are working. We're executing at a high level, and we have a solid foundation for growth
as we move forward.
Now let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with wireless on slide five. Our wireless strategy is
working. Our efforts to reposition the smartphone base to the no-subsidy model have taken hold. We continue to see
solid evidence that our efforts are paying off.
First, the most significant shift of our smartphone customers to Mobile Share Value plans is behind us. This has helped
stabilize service revenues, which were essentially flat for the quarter. There was heavy promotional activity in last
year's second quarter, which pressured service revenues, so our disciplined sales approach this year helped in our
year-over-year comparison.
Second, as service revenues stabilized and the number of customers using AT&T Next increases, we have seen our
postpaid phone ARPU with Next increase steadily. It was up more than 6% year over year. And our postpaid
phone-only revenues increased sequentially, reaching its highest level in three quarters. We are about halfway through
the expected Next sales cycle as customers upgrade their smartphones. As they do, we expect continued ARPU with
Next growth as more customers upgrade.

Our focus on costs, Cricket's operational efficiencies, and other cost savings programs such as Project Agile helped
drive strong margin expansion in the quarter. Our adjusted wireless EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, our best
performance ever and an almost 600 basis point improvement over last year's second quarter.
The story of the last six quarters has been repositioning our smartphone pace. This has moved subscribers away from
the heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly pricing. For the last several quarters, customers on pre-Next
pricing have been ahead of us, but we are starting to see the benefits of this strategy. Let's talk more about that on slide
six.
We have made remarkable progress in transitioning our customers to Mobile Share Value plans. In a little more than a
year, nearly two-thirds of our smartphone base has moved to the no-subsidy discount pricing of Mobile Share Value.
While customers continue to choose these plans, the growth rate is slowing as the penetration has been achieved. On
the other hand, the revenue growth opportunity with AT&T Next has much farther to go. About 68% of our smartphone
sales in the quarter were on AT&T Next, but our Next customer base is only about 37%. That gives us substantial
opportunity to grow revenues as these customers upgrade their smartphones.
We expect penetration rates for both Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next to continue to grow. AT&T Next and
bring-your-own-device are about 90% of postpaid smartphone sales at our company-owned stores, and we have
programs in place to generate similar or better rates in our other channels.
And the value of Mobile Share Value plans continues to draw new customers. Only about 12% of our smartphone base
is still on unlimited data plans, and that has been steadily dropping as customers choose to move to our new Mobile
Share Value plans. We also continue to see growth in the percentage of our postpaid base on Mobile Share Value
family plans or business plans. That total has reached 96% in this past quarter. These plans tend to be more sticky with
lower churn.
We also turned another strong net add quarter, as postpaid, prepaid, and connected devices drove our highest net adds
in more than three years. Those details are on slide seven. Total net adds came in at 2.1 million subscribers, including
410,000 postpaid subscribers and 1.4 million connected devices.
Cricket is really kicking into gear. Prepaid voice had a strong turnaround year from a year ago. We gained more than
330,000 prepaid voice customers after losing about that many in the year-ago quarter. Our process has been benefited
by our ability to transition the Cricket customers to our new high-quality 4G LTE network. Our strong sales efforts and
the near completion of the Cricket integration helped drive that turnaround.
Ninety-seven percent of Cricket customers are now on our GSM platform, as we continue the integration and as we
shut down the CDMA networks. These are premium prepaid customers. Almost all are choosing smartphones when
they go onto our GSM platform, and about two-thirds of the gross adds are choosing our highest value plans. Those are
plans that have higher ARPU. In fact, those ARPU levels are similar and sometimes better than other carriers' postpaid
ARPU. And we're doing this integration faster and with less churn than we originally anticipated, even with our
network conversion. We had our lowest ever prepaid churn thanks to continued progress with Cricket, even as we
decommissioned the networks.
We also had our second largest connected device net add quarter ever. Our leadership in connected cars drove that
growth. Our relationship with eight car manufacturers, producing more than half of the new connected cars in the
United States, is driving this as more and more manufacturers make connectivity a key part of their new car strategies.
The company had 7.2 million branded smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the second quarter. We increased our
high-quality branded smartphone base by about 1.2 million in the quarter. This includes branded upgrades and
migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. The smartphone momentum plus strength in prepaid led to
positive branded voice net adds in the quarter.
Churn continues to be solid. Postpaid churn was down slightly from the first quarter of this year. And for the year,
we're still running below last year's best ever annual postpaid churn record of 1.04%. Total churn was also impressive.
It dropped 16 basis points to 1.31% from 1.47% in the year-ago quarter, driven in large part by the significant

improvements in prepaid. And branded churn was also down year over year, as we added than 740,000 branded
devices.
Now let's look at our wireline operations. That information is on slide eight. The repositioning of our wireline base also
is working. The challenge here is to maintain margins while transitioning customers to IP services from higher-margin
legacy services. That's not a simple task, but the team's extraordinary efforts to control costs and focus on profitability
has helped stabilize or even expand margins as we made this transition. That was true this quarter, even with about $40
million or 30 basis points of additional pressure from spring storms that hit our network and our footprint.
We have taken several measures to make this possible. You know of our efforts to exit low-margin wholesale
businesses causes revenue pressure, but it does improve the future of our business. Our customer service focus has
helped reduce cycle times in provisioning services for customers and added network-on-demand capabilities with our
next-generation network investments. These efforts were recently recognized by IDC, which named AT&T a leader in
seeking new innovations to improve customer service.
Our Project Agile is more of a mindset than just a cost efficiency program. We're not only finding ways to take costs
out of our business but also working to make things simpler to start with for both our customers and us. Our
transformation IP technologies continued to drive strong performance in both strategic business services and wireline
consumer in the quarter. Adjusted strategic service revenues grew by nearly 14%. And when you adjust for the foreign
exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 16%.
At the same time, we see the impact of IP with our data revenues. Total data revenues are nearly 60% of wireline
business revenues. And more than half of those revenues are from strategic services as we transition customers from
legacy data services. This has helped drive total data year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter.
Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.9%. However, if you adjust for the impact of our discontinued
wholesale businesses and FX, the decline would have been 1.7%. There was revenue pressure across our wireline
business operation but was most pronounced in wholesale, where we have been focusing on profitable sales even if it
meant a reduction in revenue.
Small business revenue was down slightly over the first quarter of the year, but we continue to see fiber sales
accelerate. And we were very excited to hear that AT&T has been named the highest ranked brand in overall business
wireline customer satisfaction performance in the J.D. Power small-to-medium business segment for 2015. That's quite
a tribute to the business team's efforts in this space.
On the consumer side, U-verse services more than 70% of consumer revenues, and adjusted revenues grew about 19%
year over year. That helped drive our strongest consumer revenue growth in five quarters, growing by 3.7% when
adjusting for the sale of Connecticut operations. You also see our focus on profitability and repositioning our customer
base with U-verse. Video net adds dropped with fewer promotions and our targeting of high-value subscribers. We did
at about 240,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter as we continue to reposition our DSL base to IP. That work is
nearing completion, with less than 1 million eligible DSL subscribers left to transition.
Now let's look at consolidated margins, which are on slide nine. The strength in wireless and stable wireline margins
had a positive impact on our consolidated margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew to $11.1 billion,
and the adjusted consolidated margin was 33.6% compared to 31.5% last year. That's a more than 200 basis point
improvement.
Adjusted operating income also is showing continued improvement. It was $6.5 billion, up 12.4% year over year. And
adjusted operating income margin grew to 19.6%, up more than 190 basis points from the year-earlier second quarter.
This was largely due to cost focus initiatives, which included Project Agile, our strength in wireless, growth in
consumer revenues, and gains in strategic business services. The company also benefited from lower trailing expenses
from capital spending as Project VIP was completed. And our move to next-generation networks is starting to make a
real difference as well.

Now let's move to cash flow, where we had an outstanding quarter. The summary is on slide 10. Our ability to generate
cash continues to be strong. Cash from operations totaled $9.2 billion. That's nearly four times our dividend
commitment and our best cash generation in seven quarters, and we generated $15.9 billion in cash year to date. Capital
expenditures totaled $4.7 billion and $8.7 billion year to date. We still expect standalone capital spending in the $18
billion range this year, but we are now including our expansion efforts in Mexico in that amount.
Free cash flow was $4.5 billion and $7.2 billion year to date. We are well on our way to hitting our standalone free cash
flow guidance we gave you earlier this year. We now expect standalone free cash flow excluding any impact from
DIRECTV in the $12 billion range or better, and this includes the operational and capital impacts from our Mexican
acquisitions.
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a free cash flow to dividend payout ratio of 55%
for the quarter and about 67% year to date. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.15 times, similar to the first
quarter. We did issue debt in the second quarter to help finance our acquisition activities. Our long-range goal is to get
these levels back to the 1.8 times range and expect our cash focus to be on paying down debt in the near term. This
strong financial performance in the first half of the year sets us up well for the transformation and diversification of our
business.
Now let me close with a quick summary of the quarter on slide 11 before we get to your questions. Our transformation
plan is working. When you build a great network, develop next-generation products, and focus on the customer, good
things happen. This focus drove strong results in the quarter that saw growing revenues, expanding margins, and
double-digit adjusted EPS growth. But just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business, which we
did. All this is in line or better than guidance that we gave you earlier this year. These results add to our confidence that
we're on track to hit our standalone guidance metrics.
Wireless financials were solid as we near completion of our shift to Mobile Share Value plans. Next take rates continue
to increase, helping drive increasing postpaid phone with Next ARPU. Our prepaid brands are doing great, and our
expense management helped drive our best ever service margins. Our move into Mexico positions us as the only
company who owns and operates a North American mobile service area that will serve more than 400 million people
with 4G LTE service, and we expect to reach 350 million people by year end. Owning these network assets not only
provides a high level of service quality for our customers but also gives us owners' economics advantages.
We are also very pleased that an order to approve our DIRECTV transaction with certain conditions is circulating at the
FCC. We expect final approval at any time. We won't be able to address any of your questions about the deal today
during this call, but I can tell you this. First, as far as any conditions that Chairman Wheeler alluded earlier to this
week, we feel very confident that we can make an adequate return on any investment we make as part of this deal. Our
threshold for investment and determining what's best for our shareholders has not changed.
Second, we still fully expect to achieve $2.5 billion worth of cost synergies from this transaction. That also has not
changed. We planned a webcast and Analyst Day from Dallas very soon after the deal closes to discuss our strategy in
much more detail. We are more confident than ever about the opportunity this transaction brings. We are building a
unique communications and entertainment company that we believe will not only transform us but transform our
industry as well, and we are very anxious to talk with you about it.
With that, Laurie, let's go ahead and take some questions.

<A - John J. Stephens>: Good afternoon, John.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: The two things I think that stood out the most in the report were the service revenue trends
and the wireless margins. So first on the service revenue, given the trends you're seeing and the slowing shift to Mobile
Share Value, do you feel confident that we can get to growth in that line item in the second half of the year given the
competitive environment?
And then on the margins, big improvement there, 600 basis points on a year-over-year basis. There were some
add-backs. But is that the kind of improvement we should see throughout the rest of the year? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: John, good question, thanks. First, let me say this. We're pleased with the team's efforts on
cost containment, and that really helped push the margins up. They did a great job, and they continue with that focus.
On the service revenues, we did get a little bit of benefit this quarter from the promotional activity that took place last
year. So the disciplined sales approach that the team took was really important to driving that good performance in
service revenues. While we're not giving specific guidance either on service margins or on the specific amount of
wireless margins, we're going to stay with our guidance that we did have out there that we continue to expect to grow
overall revenues in our business and that we're going to continue to expect to grow margins both on the wireless and on
the consolidated side. So I'll stick with that. But yes, we are very encouraged by the discipline that the team has shown
is impressive, and we see every reason to continue that focus and discipline.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: All right. Thanks, John.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess if we could talk about Mexico, can you expand for us on the plan
there? You've talked about $3 billion in investment. How does that split out across CapEx, OpEx? What's the timing?
And when can we see those networks really integrated and ready to start ramping growth? Thanks, John.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Phil. The $3 billion capital investment is capital dollars. It's expected over about a
four-year period. I won't suggest to you, and it will include updating 100 million POPs to LTE. But as I've said before,
that won't be linear. Each additional POP won't have the same capital investment associated with it because we will
focus our efforts on those in best position to be upgraded and those best positioned to serve customers. That's how we'll
get to 40 million POPs we're targeting by the end of this year. So the, if you will, capital will not be spread evenly or
ratably over the cycle time. With that being said, I think you can view us as getting to that 40 million POPs next year.
And at the end of I think it's 2018, we talked about we'll get to full 100 million POPs. That's the spread plan that we
have, Phil. But the $3 billion is capital dollars.
With regard to this year, what we really want to make sure is clear is, as we spelled out in the separate international
segment, the international business right now is requiring some investment. We're aware of that. We expected it, and
we're going to make those investments. And with that investment and the investment in capital this year, we still
believe two things will happen. We'll be able to come through on the CapEx in the $18 billion range for the total
company, including the Mexico CapEx, and we'll generate free cash flow in the $12 billion range or better, including
both the capital and operational expense requirements of the Mexico business.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: If I can just follow up.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: The $18 billion in CapEx this year implies a nice downtick in the U.S. spending. What's
driving that? Are you finding you just don't need to spend it, or are you pushing that out to next year?

<A - John J. Stephens>: I think a couple things. The simplest thing is to say the network team did a great job of
getting the work done. And we've got nearly 310 million POPs with LTE right now, and we're putting a lot of spectrum
to use as opposed to building towers. And so that aspect of it is just a utilization of spectrum we own and capabilities
we have that don't require as much CapEx.
Secondly, the 57 million IP broadband and what is now approximately 900,000 business customer locations passed
with fiber, once again, the network has done a great job of getting the Project VIP initiatives completed. And when
they're done, the additional spend isn't necessary because the project has been completed, not for lack of anything but
for success. That's what's driving our changes. We continue to focus on working capital and construction work in
progress and driving down cycle times and a whole host of other efforts the team is doing really good work on, and
that's also helping out.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Got it.
<A - John J. Stephens>: But it's really positive things that are driving this capability. We're going to continue to invest
in capacity. We'll continue to invest in successful sales. We feel very good about our ability to continue to respond to
customers in a positive way.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Thanks, John.

And we go to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: Hey, guys, thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: John, I just had a quick comment on competitive positioning. Thinking about the
handset losses in the quarter, clearly ceding a little bit of share here at the benefit of probably margins and probably
some of the ARPU trends, but just maybe a comment on those sub losses you're seeing on the handset side, the quality
of those subs. And then secondly, John, your thoughts on cash taxes as we look into 2016.
<A - John J. Stephens>: A couple of things, Mike. Thanks for the question. First of all, let me say it this way. On a
branded net add basis, we weren't negative on voice, we were positive. We added voice customers. Now on the
postpaid category, we did lose some feature phones, which have our lowest ARPUs. But on the prepaid side with both
our Cricket and our GoPhone brands, we added some premium customers. I think I mentioned that two-thirds of the
Cricket customers are buying out of the higher plans. Those are $50 and $60 a month plans. About two-thirds or more
of our customers are buying those plans. And those ARPUs are higher than the feature phone ARPUs we're losing and,
quite frankly, higher than a lot of some of the people in the market's postpaid ARPU. So we're getting great trade-off.
The beauty of that, though, and the thing that's helping margins, there's very low acquisition subsidy cost with regard to
those customers. We did sell over 7 million smartphones in the quarter. A lot of those were in our prepaid space, but we
did sell a lot. The customers are satisfying the financial requirements of those phones such that it's allowing us to keep
our margins up.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: And, John, we've seen a meaningful amount of those postpaid feature phones moving
over to the Cricket brand or the prepaid brands?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Those would be migrations, so we would account for those as migrations, so you wouldn't
have those in our net add numbers. The 330,000 voice net adds in prepaid were all customers we acquired that had not
had service with anybody before or we took from other providers. So we feel really good about our competitive
positioning and we're really excited about our prepaid brands and very excited about what's happening with Cricket and
the quality of the customers we're getting and, quite frankly, the great job the team has done in accelerating the

integration, getting us over on our GSM, on our LTE networks, getting smartphones in these customers' hands, and
really providing quality service. Churn is – the reduction in churn is really impressive. As you can see from our slides,
overall churn, total churn, was down 16 basis points. That's mainly driven by the improvements in our prepaid.

<A - John J. Stephens>: I think the key issue in cash taxes for 2016 would generally be expected to go up because of
the tax rules in – currently in place right now; no legislation for bonus depreciation. With that being said, there has
been a bill that came out of the Senate Finance Committee I think just last week. There has been a lot of activity in the
House to extend the various tax extenders, [indiscernible] (32:57), credit, other things, and include bonus depreciation,
some say for a two-year cycle, others say to a three-year to five-year cycle, depending upon which piece of legislation
we're talking about. If those happen, we would see a significant benefit from a company who invests in the United
States and invests in jobs through CapEx in the United States. So that's yet to be seen as what will happen.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: Okay, great, John. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you, Mike.

We'll go to David Barden, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guest first, John, if I could ask the wireless
margin question another way, which is looking at the sequential change in the cost, it was about – almost $750 million
of sequential costs went away after you subtract out the merger integration expenses. So could you parse down what
happened quarter over quarter in the wireless business? And can we expect this as a starting point to be where we
should look at wireless margins for the rest of the year and into 2016?
And then I guess as a second question, it's no secret we're all trying to figure out the implications of the potential
conditions here. But I think as a level set in that conversation, could you go through what you're able to talk about in
terms of the scope of the current GigaPower initiative, the economics around that initiative, cost per home passed, so
we can all be on the same page in that conversation? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So let me start with wireless. There a couple of things we need to be focused on. One is we
made significant progress with regard to Cricket and the integration of it, so we've been able to free up a lot of
spectrum over the year to take in capacity in a very efficient and low-cost way to be able to serve customers more
effectively, get more [ph] LTE add (34:50).
Secondly, Cricket, as you know, the company we bought was operating we'll say in a challenged environment with
challenged results from a margin and an operating income perspective. The team has put in place integration plans and
activated those and effectuated those that are now improving and growing EBITDA and operating contribution in that
piece of it. So if you go back and look at the prior public company, we bought the lead company. You get a sense of if
you can turn those numbers positive, you can have a real improvement on your quarter. That's one.
Two, we have seen efforts in our customer care and specifically in our mobility customer care centers, where we've
done a whole variety of things, whether it's the sales guys keeping consistent sales offers out there, whether it's the
retail stores having the sales agents spend more time to make sure customers explain it, whether it's moving towards
getting it right the first time and getting the first call resolution, or it's our extensive investments over the last few years
in digital-first and allowing customers to, for example, order, upgrade, buy different packages, pay their bills, those
types of things on their smartphones. All of that has driven call volumes down significantly in our care centers to the
tune of we'll probably have a drop for this year of about 10 million phone calls out of our mobility care centers alone,
so that's another activity that's gone. Our LTE network is a lower-cost network, and we're continuing to see people use
more data and buying up into bigger plans. That's helping.

Additionally, we are seeing our customers seem to want to hold their phones longer under the Next plan, at least longer
than we had initially expected. And with that, we are seeing cost savings there. So those are all part of what we saw in
the second quarter, and we're optimistic that we'll be able to continue much of that momentum, maybe at different
levels, but we're going to be able to continue that momentum going forward. So we're very optimistic about that.
With regard to the transaction, I won't make any comments. With regard to GigaPower, we've announced an effort to
go into 25 major markets to place fiber-to-the-prem in those. We have done it and started in some additional markets in
Dallas and Austin and some others. Our initial results have been very encouraging. Our sales have exceeded our
expectations. We're seeing great, if you will, Net Promoter Scores from our customers who take those services, and
we're encouraged by that. And I think based on prudence, I'll leave the comments with regard to it at that, but we are
encouraged by what we've seen out of GigaPower and the capabilities it brings not only to our customers but to us as a
service provider.

Operator
And we go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much. John, I was wondering if we could switch gears back to the stuff in
the competitive environment, particularly in the wireless arena. There have been a lot of discussions around levels of
promotional activity in the first part of the year, whether or not we're at elevated levels or depressed levels versus last
year. As you look out towards the remainder of the year, you had mentioned that you're taking a disciplined approach. I
was wondering if you could give us a bit more color in terms of your strategy going forward here in terms of either
from a promotional standpoint or if there is some new products coming down the line with this merger, the type of
strategies that you're taking for customer acquisition.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Let me just say it this way. We are certainly evaluating and watching our competitors' moves
in the marketplace. What I would I tell you is that we're not responding to each and every one from a discounting
program. We've shown that kind of discipline. We have responded with an effort to make customer care easier,
customer service easier, customer data situations like Rollover Data, where we can meet some of the customers' pain
points and satisfy them. And we've done a great job in providing a value customer solution with our prepaid brands.
Those are the kinds of things we're going to do and continue to do. I think you've seen in our numbers that this
disciplined approach has paid off. And as I mentioned, we did have positive voice net adds, so we feel good about what
it has done to the positioning. Quite frankly, the biggest strategy play that we've had in that wireless space was
probably the acquisition of Cricket and giving us that capability, that platform, and that distribution to really serve
those value customers in a different way.
But if you will, yes, it's a competitive market. It continues to be noisy in a competitive market, but it's been that way for
some time, and I wouldn't expect it necessarily to change. But I do like our ability to compete with the tools that we
have that are different than our competitors, having that premium prepaid, having Mobile Share Value, having Next,
having connected cars and connected devices, having all those tools in this great network, I believe we're in the best
position to compete going forward and are looking forward to that opportunity.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you, and then if I may, one brief follow-up. In thinking about churn levels, we've
seen a tick down from the prior quarter. In thinking about the scope of the competitive landscape, how do you think
that churn should progress through the course of the year?
<A - John J. Stephens>: We won't give any predictions, Amir, specifically on that. We're focused on churn as a way
of giving good service, lower churn, lower churn gives good profitability, so we certainly value it and we'll continue to
focus on it. I'll just leave it to say that through six months, our churn on a postpaid basis is lower than last year's full
year, and last year's full year was our best year ever. And secondly, as I mentioned, if you peel through our numbers,

you can see our total churn dropped 16 basis points, which means our prepaid churn, which I did mention, had its best
quarter ever for us, and our prepaid churn rate is really improving. So we're really focused on it, and we believe that
gives us that opportunity to really generate value while still being very competitive in the marketplace.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much for the additional color.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Amir.
Operator
Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. John, during your statements, you mentioned that you
are increasingly focused on driving profitability on the wireline side, and you noted that there was a small loss of video
customers against that strategy. It implies you saw something in the market that you just didn't want to respond to. So if
you could maybe give us a little color in terms of what you saw and what you didn't like and where you were really
focused strategically, that would be helpful.
And just along those lines, since the broadband numbers were just a little under run rate on U-verse, I think you had
talked about where you were from a penetration standpoint and upgrade cycle. If you could revisit that, that would be
helpful.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Okay, a couple of things. One, with regard to, we do have a tremendous focus on driving
costs out of our wireline business. As all of you know, when legacy services drop off, they usually have very high
margins to go with them. So as we're growing our strategic services and our U-verse services, we're really focused on
controlling costs so we can replace that, to maintain our profitability.
With that being said, on the U-verse video side, the first point to make is second quarter is always seasonally
challenged. You have a lot of relocations. You've got a lot of students returning from college. And with our currently
limited footprint with regard to video capabilities, it's always a challenge for us. The issue then is do you go out and do
a lot of promotional activities to stimulate growth. We chose to be very disciplined and very limited even in those
promotional activities. As you can see, it really had a unique impact in the sense that our revenues grew 3.7% or almost
4%. So it was from this disciplined approach of not getting out of hand with regard to promotional pricing, that's how
we think about it. When we are capable of bundling all our services together, we're very optimistic about our ability to
compete.
With regard to our IP broadband, it really has more to do at this time not only with the seasonality but also with the fact
that we were converting our DSL at a very high rate to our IP broadband or our high-speed broadband. That process has
achieved 13 million of these high-speed broadband, and we only have about 1 million left. So coming from a number of
years ago where we had 14 million to convert, we're down to 1 million. And so you'll see it's just a different pool to
draw from. Once again, as we have a somewhat challenged video footprint at the current time, the opportunities before
us are clear with that high-quality broadband service that we have. So I'll leave it at that.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: All right, thank you.

quarter? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So with regard to securitizations, Simon, we did do some this quarter. They were about $1
billion this quarter. And we did about $800 million in the year-ago quarter, so a slight increase in the securitizations. I
assume you're talking about the net securitizations, continue to see strong demand, continue to see a real interest in that
investment by a number of banks at very attractive rates. And we're getting to the point now that we've lapped a full
year and are building a history with regard to this program, which is very good for the company in the sense it gives us
flexibility going forward. So we're very pleased with it. We expect we'll continue to do it. But the differential year over
year was not dramatic as it may have been in some prior quarters.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay.
<A - John J. Stephens>: That's one. Two, as far as overall spectrum goes, we're always interested in looking at
spectrum and the opportunities to improve our spectrum position, and we plan for that on a regular basis. With regard
to participation in the broadcast auction, we did offer to participate when we first announced our intention to acquire
DTV. We'll wait and see what the final terms and conditions with regard to any approval of that merger are. But in any
event, I would suggest to you that we'll be interested and prudent in investigating the opportunity to see what's
available and participate in an appropriate way as we move forward.

We'll go to Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. John, so you're on track to bring the
CapEx down to the $18 billion range, but this does follow some heavy investment the past few years. As you look out
over the technology roadmap, like 5G coming down the pipeline, do you anticipate that we'll see another period of
elevated investment?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Good question, Joe. I would tell you this. From a longer-term perspective, what we are seeing
is our move to get this fiber deep into the network and getting LTE out deep into the wireless network and the solutions
that we're finding in a software-defined network opportunity, we see a real opportunity to actually strive to bring
investments, if you will, lower or more efficient from historical levels. Right now, I'll tell you that this year's
investment is going to be in that $18 billion range, which is about 15%. Certainly we're not going to give any guidance
with regard to next year or the year after, and we'll give an update on this year's guidance if and when at our Analyst
Conference we get that opportunity. With that being said, I think there's a real opportunity with some of the activities
that are going on in software-defined networks on a longer-term basis to actually bring that capital intensity to a more
modest level.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Got it, thanks.

Thank you. We go next to Frank Louthan, Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Frank Garreth Louthan>: Great, thank you. Can you give us an update on how many homes you've passed with
GigaPower and what the cost is running on that right now? And then secondly, on the wholesale business, what exactly
is the trend there? Are you losing share or is it just lower pricing or is it lower volumes, or where is that actually going?
<A - John J. Stephens>: So on the Wholesale business, the first thing is we exited our Global Hubbing business.
We've really turned that down. We're not pursuing it anymore. That's having a significant impact on the Wholesale

business. That's the first point.
The second point, what we're saying is the continued not only pressure on the legacy analog services but a movement
towards more efficient IP strategic services. So when the customers move up, sometimes they have both services in
place. But even after they shut off the legacy services, the strategic services oftentimes have more efficiency. And so
until the volumes grow to absorb that, there's a disconnect between those revenue sources. But with that being said, we
still feel very good about our win percentages and our ability to hold on to that business and our ability to grow going
forward.
The biggest first issue with regard to wholesale, though, is the fact that we've decided to get out of some business. And
then the second piece is some of this [ph] grooming (49:38) as they've transitioned to strategic services to Ethernet and
other things. But we will continue to be positive, and we continue to be able to compete well in that wholesale space.
With regard to GigaPower, I would suggest we're not giving out cost per unit pricing at this time. And let me give you
some insights into why that would be challenging at this point. There's a difference between whether you do it on an
aerial basis or a buried cable basis. There are some differences between whether you do it to multi-dwelling units or
whether you do it to a single home and a single residence. So all of those factors at this stage could mislead folks with
regard to any kind of factual numbers, so we've chosen not to do that. But we are just getting started with the
fiber-to-the-prem activity. We're very pleased with it. I can suggest to you that we're probably still in the early stages of
it, but the take rates and the satisfaction rates continue to outperform our expectations with our customers.
<Q - Frank Garreth Louthan>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Viola>: Hey, Laurie, we'll take one more question.
Operator
Very good. That is from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James M. Ratcliffe>: Hi, thanks for taking the question; two on the wireless side, if I could. First of all, can you
give a little more color about what's driving the improvement you're seeing in prepaid churn? Is it just improving credit
quality or better overall retention, something else going on there? And second, given the continued growth in connected
cars, any insight you can provide around the economics around those, what ARPUs are running, and if there are any
subsidies or revenue shares involved. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So on the prepaid business, it's a couple of things. One, great plans, great attention to our
customers, but quite frankly, they're riding on a great network. So they're getting great service with cost-efficient plans.
And we're able to do it because they're paying for their own phones. So it's really just a lot of hard work by our network
team in getting these customers converted from the network that they were on, the CDMA network they were on, onto
our LTE network. So they're having a great experience. That's one. Two, we're giving them good pricing. We can do
that because they're paying for their own phones essentially. And then our sales team and our operations team is
working very hard to integrate the quality of our networks, our backbone, and our cost structure. All of those things are
what's driving it. But the churn is really – I'm sure it has a lot to do with this great network that they're riding on. So I
would suggest to you that.
On the connected car, there are three relationships I think of when I think of that connected car on our revenue side.
There's one with the wholesale relationship with the auto manufactures/dealers. And that's the ability to deliver on-time
information, real-time information to the cars or take it from the cars for, whether it be design, marketing, activities,
analysis, upgrades to mapping, and so on and so forth. That's a wholesale relationship we have with the auto
manufacturers. And as we continue to develop applications and they continue to develop applications and information
needs out of that process, we'll continue and we're hopeful to continue to grow that revenue. The key to that is much of
that activity can be done at off-peak hours. And so the auto manufacturers can gather that data at times when it's very
cost efficient for us to do it so we can utilize our networks when they're somewhat underutilized, and they can still get
really good quality data.

Two, there's that ability to put it into a Mobile Share Value plan. And part of our Mobile Share Value plans is an
add-on service. We're just getting started with that. We're very optimistic about the opportunities there. But quite
frankly, the cars first are just rolling off. And secondly, there are some promotional time and promotional activities
where that capability is available before we sign them up to a retail package, so that process is just getting started. We
feel very good about it and think it fits within the overall connected life strategy that our mobility team is running.
And then lastly, there's a prepaid opportunity for someone who doesn't own the car but yet wants to utilize that
connectivity in that car. And we are seeing some utilization of that today, and we'll continue to see that develop. We're
optimistic and very jazzed up, so to speak, about the opportunities with the connected car. I would suggest to you that a
company that's our scale and size, we look to this to be not only a success in today's net adds, in today's relationships
with our business customers, but a success going forward in revenue generation and margin generation improvement.
Laurie, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
That will be from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thanks a lot. So, John, great job on the financial discipline. So you think the wireless
expenses is a good run rate here? I know there are a lot of moving parts. Do you think maybe you were a little light on
the marketing this quarter, or that wasn't an impact? And can you also just lastly give us some data usage statistics?
Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yes, sure, Tim. Let me say this. On the margins, there's always going to be seasonality, and
we're always going to have the challenges that are in the business. We're going to have much smoother seasonality. We
may have because of the way we've shifted the business, flipped some of the pressure quarters and the hiring quarters
around, we'll have more smoothing. But we will have additional activities as we get into the holiday season with more
units and more activities with regard to that.
Secondly, while we are going to continue to be disciplined with all costs, including marketing, I would suggest to you
we will continue to market and believe we've been effective with our marketing but not have shut it down. With regard
to, Tim, what was your last question?
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Wireless data usage and where maybe customers are in terms of the utilization of their
existing capacity?
<A - John J. Stephens>: We continue to see the data growth per handset to be significant, and it's been running at the
50% year-over-year increase for a while.
With regard to the data plans, we're seeing a couple of things. We continue to see customers buy bigger data plans,
some of the 20-gig in bigger plans. And a unique thing that's helped our service revenues this quarter was we continue
to see people do some overage. Even though we gave Rollover Data to our customers to help them manage their plans,
they took advantage of it. We continue to see some overage use. So we do have the opportunity to gets customers to
buy some bigger buckets and move themselves out of that stress opportunity. But usage continues to be a positive for
our revenue opportunities and continues to be something our network guys watch very closely so we keep this
high-quality service.
