I will now hand you over to George.
George Rollo Fairweather
Thank you, Gerald.
Overall, we are pleased with our progress this quarter, with results in line with our expectations. As in the last quarter,
we were particularly pleased with growth in U.S. pharmacy volume and market share.
During the quarter, we also completed the $1 billion share buyback program which we discussed on our last earnings
call. I'm also pleased that today we have raised the lower end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance, for fiscal
year 2017, by $0.08.
So now, let's look at the financial highlights for the quarter. As we expected, currency, again, had a negative impact.
The U.S. dollar being 12.5% stronger versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year. Sales for the quarter were
$30.1 billion, up 2.1% versus the comparable quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 5%.
GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 1%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots
Alliance were $1.2 billion, up 5.3% and diluted EPS was $1.07, up 5.9%. Adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion,
up 5.5% and in constant currency was up 7.5%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were
$1.4 billion, up 11.9% and in constant currency up 13.6%.
These percentage increases were higher than for adjusted operating income. This was due to a lower tax rate partially
offset by losses on certain legacy investments, which adversely impacted both earnings from other equity method
investments and other income. Since the quarter-end, we've disposed of a legacy investment, the gain on which will
largely offset these losses.
The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the adjusted equity income from AmerisourceBergen,
was 19.1%. This was lower than in the comparable quarter last year, primarily due to relatively high incremental
discrete net tax benefits and a lower estimated core annual tax rate of 25.3%. All of this resulted in adjusted diluted net
earnings per share of $1.33, up 12.7%, and in constant currency, up 14.4%.
For completeness, here are the numbers for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. I will not go through those in great
detail, but you will note that GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $3.02, up 4.9% versus the same period a year
ago. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $3.79, up 7.7% and up 9.9% on a constant currency basis.
So, let me now turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail
Pharmacy USA sales were $22.5 billion, up 6.3% over the year ago quarter. This included two months of results from
AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, our recently formed central specialty and mail services business. Comparable store sales
for the division increased by 3.7%. Adjusted gross profit was $5.7 billion, down 0.5%, reflecting a decrease in
pharmacy partially offset by an increase in retail. We'll look at this in more detail in a moment.

Adjusted SG&A for the division was 18.7% of sales, an improvement of 1.7 percentage points. This improvement was
primarily due to sales mix and higher sales as well as an amendment to certain employee post-retirement benefits and
our cost transformation program. Adjusted operating margin was 6.5%, in line with the comparable quarter last year,
resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion, up 5.9%.
So next, let's look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 10.3% versus the year ago quarter,
mainly due to higher prescription volumes including mail and central specialty. During the quarter, we filled 255.2
million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis including immunizations, an increase of 8.5%. On a comparable basis
for stores, which exclude central specialty and mail, pharmacy sales increased by 5.8% with scripts filled up 8.3%.
In the second quarter, we reported our highest quarterly growth rate in over seven years. This quarter was even better.
Growth was primarily due to strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and the positive impact of our strategic
pharmacy partnerships. Within sales, volume growth and brand inflation were partially offset by reimbursement
pressure and the impact of generics. This pressure contributed to lower pharmacy gross profit and gross margin.
A higher proportion of specialty adversely impacted pharmacy gross margin by around 100 basis points. However, the
higher specialty sales had a positive impact on gross profit. Our reported retail prescriptions market share, on the usual
30-day adjusted basis, was 20.5%, up by approximately 110 basis points over the year ago quarter. This was the highest
market share that we have ever reported.
Total retail sales were down 1.8% on the same quarter last year. This included the impact of the previously-announced
closure of certain e-commerce operations. Comparable retail sales were down 0.4%, with declines in the consumables
and general merchandise category and in the personal care category, partially offset by solid growth in the health and
wellness and beauty categories.
Adjusted gross profit was higher, primarily due to mix and underlying margin improvement. Beauty category
performance and beauty differentiation stores continues to be markedly better than in other stores, supported by strong
sales growth of No7 and Soap & Glory. We've also continued to introduce new brands into our existing beauty
differentiation locations, including Botanics, which I mentioned last quarter. We remain on track to introduce our
enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores by the end of the calendar year.
This quarter, as part of our strategy and ongoing cost transformation, we've also begun to implement a program in
certain stores to simplify our offering and improve our retail operational performance. This is designed to deliver a
better experience for our customers, provide ongoing efficiencies and reduce working capital. In the coming months,
we expect this program to reach approximately 1,500 stores.
So now, let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $2.8 billion,
down 0.2% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter. Comparable store sales increased 0.2% in constant
currency. Comparable pharmacy sales were down 0.1% on a constant currency basis, mainly due to a decline in the
UK.
In Boots UK, comparable pharmacy sales were down 0.4%, mainly due to the reduction in government pharmacy
funding. Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.4%, Boots UK's comparable retail sales, increasing 0.1%.
Within this, beauty was Boots UK's strongest category, assisted by the launch of No7 Restore & Renew Face & Neck
Multi Action Serum.
Adjusted gross profit for the division at $1.1 billion was down 1.2% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter,
mainly due to lower pharmacy gross margin. Adjusted SG&A, as a percentage of sales, on a constant currency basis
was 0.7 percentage points higher at 34%, mainly due to inflationary pressures and higher variable payroll costs.
Adjusted operating margin was 6.9%, down 1.1 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted
operating income of $193 million, a decrease of 14% again in constant currency.
I'm delighted to report that in April, the first Boots franchise store opened in South Korea. This is in line with our
strategy of expanding Boots' retail presence in Asia. South Korea is a highly-sophisticated beauty market, particularly
for cosmetics, and it's strategically important for sourcing innovative products.

So now, let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.3 billion, up 2.7% versus
the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis were up 3.7%.
This was ahead of the company's estimated market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales, with
growth in emerging markets and the UK partially offset by challenging market conditions in Continental Europe.
Adjusted operating margin, which excludes ABC, was 2.9%, down 0.1 percentage points on a constant currency basis,
but in line with the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was $253 million, up 53.1% in constant currency.
Excluding adjusted equity earnings from ABC, adjusted operating income was up 0.6% in constant currency.
So turning next to capital allocation. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.9 billion. During the quarter, our
working capital inflow was $502 million. This primarily reflected improvements in inventories both in the quarter and
year-on-year. Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $273 million. We continue to invest in our core customer
proposition, including our stores and U.S. beauty program as well as the upgrades to our IT systems which we have
previously talked about. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow in the quarter of $1.6 billion, with a total of $4.3 billion
in the year to date.
Turning next to our guidance for fiscal 2017, we have raised the lower end of our guidance and now anticipate adjusted
diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.98 to $5.08. Remember, this guidance assumes current exchange
rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year.
I will now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments.
Stefano Pessina
Thank you, George. I will turn first to the new Rite Aid agreement, which we announced this morning.
When we first began discussion with Rite Aid, it was with a vision of increasing our network and our population
coverage. It quickly became clear that if we could structure a transaction appropriately, potentially greater benefit could
be gained by bringing the two entire companies together through an acquisition. However, given the changes in the
market during the longer than expected Federal Trade Commission review process and the ongoing uncertainty about
the potential outcome, we have decided, after detailed discussion with Rite Aid, not to continue to pursue the
acquisition of the whole company.
Instead, we have today announced the proposed purchase of 2,186 stores from Rite Aid together with the warehouses
and inventory to support those stores. While we are assuming the real estate obligation, we are not assuming any debt.
In addition, the deal is also expected to give a significant cash tax benefit as we tax amortize the intangible assets we
acquire. This transaction, though smaller than the original, is due to our original strategic aim and, I believe, simpler to
deliver both operationally and financially.
Overall, I view this deal as being more attractive than the transaction it replaces, recognizing the adjustment and
compromises that we have had to make since the original deal was announced, in what continues to be a challenging
market for pharmacy. We expect that this new smaller deal will deliver synergies in excess of $400 million per annum
within three to four years of the initial closing and be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first full
year after the initial closing.
Importantly, the stores we are proposing to purchase are more than enough to create the potential opportunity for
optimization of our expanded network, and in doing so, the opportunity to create greater efficiency above and beyond
the synergies that the deal is expected to deliver. In addition, the deal is structured in such a way as to offer
opportunities for additional benefits over time.
In constructing this new agreement, we have endeavored to address all the substantive regulatory points raised about
the original transaction. We believe that this will enable us to complete the transaction in a timely manner and drive
forward with our plans to further grow our company.

I am pleased to have, once again, been proved right in my firm belief that, as the English say, where there is a will,
there is a way; that two willing partners can, despite adversity, find a deal that delivers true benefits for both.
Given the significantly lower cost of the new transaction, I am pleased that today we have been able also to keep our
commitment to our investors that we will not maintain an inefficient balance sheet longer than is absolutely necessary.
This is why we are planning to return the surplus cash that we are carrying on the balance sheet beyond the debt
required for the new proposed transaction to our shareholders through a new $5 billion share repurchase program. This
is in addition to the $1 billion program which we initiated and completed during our third quarter.
On completion of this new program, we will resume our regular reviews of capital deployment, design it to ensure that
excess capital, where appropriate, is used as directly as possible to improve shareholder value.
Of course, today our new proposed transaction with Rite Aid is not our only news. As George said, we have seen
progress in many areas of our business in the quarter we are reviewing today, and this has been achieved in an
environment when we have seen continued competitive pressures, challenging markets, and regulatory uncertainty.
Naturally, there is nothing new in this, but it means we must remain focused to ensure our business is meeting the
needs of the market and to maintain our strong position.
We are working with our strategic partners to maximize our own role in the healthcare system while at the same time
providing the right services at the right price to support those partners in their task of staying efficient and relevant.
The merger that created Walgreens Boots Alliance and the subsequent restructuring and the realigning of our business
was an important step in the process. As we are coming to a successful conclusion of that process of transformation, we
must look again at the company to understand and identify the next course for us to make sure the business is the right
structure, shape, and size and with the right skills and resources to truly deliver on the opportunities that change offers.
Our proposed transaction with Rite Aid would form a part of this, but only part. We continue to see many opportunities
both inside the business and potentially outside with other strategic partners and other partnerships. We should be in no
doubt that this is where my focus is. Working with my entire team to identify the next step for the business and
ensuring whatever we do advances our place in the market is important for our customers and our strategic partner,
delivers clear direction for our people, and of course provides an attractive opportunity to deliver meaningful growth
and create true value for our shareholders.
It is obvious to us that the pressures on healthcare as a whole and by extension pharmacy will continue. Within the
healthcare market, we face a range of strong competitors. We each have our own business model. At times, that may
give them certain advantages over us, but at other times we believe it gives us meaningful strength and advantages over
them. Managing our company for growth in these markets is a core role of the executive team, and we are never
complacent about our position in the market or the competition we face, current and potential.
Remember also that new participants in the market also provide the opportunity for new partnership and collaboration.
Change brings opportunity as well as challenges. We continue to forge and strengthen strategic partnerships that are
delivering real benefits for our businesses today, especially in the U.S., where we are seeing volumes returning to our
pharmacies and opportunities arising that enhance both our retail and healthcare offerings. This will open paths for us
to new services with new sources of potential revenue and income over time.
So as you have heard, overall we believe it has been a reasonable quarter, where some progress has been made. As a
result, we are raising the lower end of our guidance for the year as a whole. We do, however, continue to experience
some very challenging markets. And as I have said, we expect these challenges to continue, indeed may possibly get
more difficult in the months and years to come.
We are completing a phase of our business where we were very much focused on driving the optimum benefit from the
merger that created Walgreens Boots Alliance. In this phase, we have delivered far more, both in terms of efficiencies
and cost, than we had originally anticipated.
While we continue the careful and methodical work to drive efficiency and excellence across our business, we are
beginning to look at the next phase of the evolution of our company. We believe this next phase will mainly be focused

on Walgreens, and on the structure and merchandising of our retail operation, which will be intended to deliver further
saving and create real value from within the business.
Building on the sound corporate discipline we are exercising, the exceptional presence we have across the world and
the ability that gives us to reach people at the time and place convenient to them, we have an excellent opportunity to
be a cornerstone in the healthcare system we work within and a cornerstone of the communities we serve.
As you have heard from George, we have opened our first Boots franchise stores in South Korea and we continue to
look to expand the geographic presence of our business including increasing our presence in Asia, particularly China,
with more of a focus on retail in these markets than we have had up to now. It is all too easy to allow the reasonable
and important focus on quarterly performance as a measure of progress to distract us from our longer-term
opportunities, but I am confident in my belief that the challenges we face along the way are more the stepping stones
than obstacles to the longer term growth of our company in the months and years ahead.
I will now hand you over to Gerald so that we can answer any questions you may have. Thank you. Now I will hand
you back to Gerald.
Gerald Gradwell
Thank you, Stefano. I'd now like to ask Candace, our operator, to open the lines for questions, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Elizabeth Anderson>: Hi, this is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross today. I was wondering – congratulations on the
deal that you announced today. And I was just wondering if you could talk about, one, the profit profile of some of the
stores that you are looking to acquire and the attraction of that subcategory of stores. And then two, more generally
speaking, could you talk a little bit more about some of the additional partnerships you guys have been considering and
sort of the assets that you guys bring for the table and what sort of things you think might be particularly helpful?
Thanks.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Elizabeth. Good morning. It's Alex here. The profit profile, first of all, of the stores
we're acquiring is more or less the average profile of Rite Aid, maybe slightly less but more or less the same. And also
the same investment profile, you know that Rite Aid have been investing well in their wellness format. And again,
these stores have got the same profile as the stores they're retaining. So, we feel pretty good about that.
And they're mainly doing a filling in the Northeast, the mid-Atlantic and the Southern-Eastern regions to give us more
presence in these regions and to improve, obviously, the service of Walgreens, over time, can give to customers and
patients in these areas. So we feel good about that core of stores we're acquiring. We think they are good value for us
and it will really, really improve our network, particularly in the regions that mentioned.
In terms of partnerships, I think we also, yesterday, saw we announced our partnership with LabCorp, which we're
really, really pleased with, a seventh store trial called LabCorp at Walgreens. And that adds on to the partnerships that
we've announced in the past, particularly with clinics across the many healthcare systems in the U.S.
And how we see this working, both from a space usage point of view, a convenience being coursed to our pharmacy
and then linking into the various IT systems and technologies that we have. We really see this will drive not just the
cost reduction for us, but real convenience and access for customers and ultimately, of course, more volume
prescriptions for us over time and more healthcare and pharmacy services.

So, we've made good progress in the last couple years with the strategy. There's more to come, and as long as it fits
from a customer point of view next to our pharmacy and as long as it makes sense to reduce the cost in the healthcare
system, we'll continue to test and trial and rollout these services.
<Q - Elizabeth Anderson>: Perfect, thanks. That's really helpful.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: If we could just ask the questioners please to ask their questions loudly and clearly,
we're in quite a big room. And so also forgive us if we have to ask you to repeat it if we didn't catch it the first time
around.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Good morning. Thank you. So, Stefano, you talked about looking at the next phase of the
evolution of the company and it sounds like partially it's focused on the retail side and merchandising, but also on the
healthcare side. So can you talk a little bit about – give us more color on how you think of expanding Walgreens' role
in the delivery of healthcare?
And are you thinking about it from a partnership model similar to what you signed with LabCorp, what you announced
with LabCorp yesterday? Or are you also kind of like considering opportunities where, like, you can deploy capital
especially when we think about, kind of like the whole concept of vertical integration that's discussed in the
marketplace?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: I have spoken of the second phase of development in our company. You see when we merged,
of course, our focus was on synergies, our focus was on cutting cost. And, as you have seen, we have been consistent
with what we were saying and we have really achieved the level of synergies and the level of cost reductions
substantially earlier than promised. And at the end of this year, we will have, for sure, better numbers than even we
were expecting.
So, now, as I said many times, the integration of the company and the improvement of a new company goes through
different phases. Now, we have done the first phase and we have other phases. And in each phase, we will be able to
reduce cost and probably to find additional synergies. For the time being, we have rationalized the company, we have
gone through the most evident cost reduction that we could see. We have improved our procurement and we have tried
to buy better or to exploit all the possibilities that we had due to our scale and our geographic expansion.
And now we have to go back and refine the work that we have done. And of course, now our focus will be mainly on
Walgreens and mainly on the stores. Of course, we have done important things in the stores. We have improved the
supply chains. We have changed or started to change the mindset of people focusing more on the customers. We have
started to collect information and data on our customers in order to understand better what they wanted and what we
could do for them.
And now, it's time to put all these things together and to reorganize our stores in that direction. We have to understand
exactly which kind of categories are really of interest for our customers because it's not particularly useful to offer a bit
of everything if people are not really appreciating it. And so, we said that we are really focusing more on beauty, on
health and beauty particularly. And so, as you have seen, we have started to roll out more products, we have started to
test many models, but now it's time to really go back and really put in, act, put in the store. So all the experience that
we have done in these two years, and this will be the focus of the second phase of the development.
Part of this, for sure, is the logic of having other players with us in our stores, because we have space. We will get more
space with the rationalization of the stores and we have to use this space for trying to give a better experience to our
customers. And so, you know that we are trialing many different partnerships. And most of those trials have been
successful and we have to hold them out over time. The combination of these two things will give a new look to our
stores, which is what we need and what we had really – really, what was really in our strategy from the very first

moment. But we had to create the platform, the basis, in order to build this transformation of the stores.
And after we will have another phase, a third phase, which will be based on technology. We are making big
investments, big efforts in updating – upgrading our technology. We will have a completely new system in a few years,
maybe few years in the next, I would say, many months. And at that point, we would be able to make another jump in
the organization of our stores and this will be the third phase. This is exactly what we told you, I'd say, from the very
beginning of at least in the last two years and this is the program that we are following.
Alex, do you want to add something?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: No, I think it's really clear, Stefano. Just one is that, I think, it was as mentioned in
prepared remarks, we're really moving into a phase beyond the beauty differentiation phase of simplifying our offer, the
core offer. And we're starting to rollout into – up to 1,000 stores by the end of this year. So, it's another important step
in the phase two as Stefano described. So this is very active. It's very real in the business and we continue to drive that
model forward.
And the idea of this one really is to simplify these stores, and to such an extent that customers can find products more
easily, and we can edit the products on their behalf using the data that we have been collecting in the last three or four
years. So, we're not slowing down here. We're actually speeding up is the main point I want to add to Stefano's
description of the activity.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Okay, and just one follow-up on the guide. One is for the guide for the rest of the year
and the other one within the context of this comment, how should we think about the growth or algorithm going
forward? So for the guide for the remaining quarter, does the increased guidance include the buyback program? And
are you going to see any benefit from taxes next quarter?
And then when we think longer term to 2018 and beyond, do you think that given the competitive environment in the
marketplace, but also your efforts to simplify the offering and it sounds like potentially maybe narrowing the SKUs, do
you think that you can sustain double-digit EPS growth now that you know what the Rite Aid deal would look like?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Okay, I'll try and take some of those in the right order. If I start perhaps with just
the tax, as I said in the prepared comments, the core tax rate was 25.3%. And then this quarter if you look back
historically, we had a relatively high number of discrete positives. Discrete positives clearly vary significantly
quarter-by-quarter, as you can see, going back historically. And as I say, you can see this was a relatively high number.
But I think in terms of the core tax rate and helping with the model, the 25.3% that you see to-date is clearly under U.S.
GAAP or the rate that we would anticipate at this point for the core tax element for the full year.
Just in terms of buyback program, clearly, we've announced the program just today. And I think, and just in thinking
about modeling, clearly, we're at pretty well the end of June now. So, we've really only got a couple of months to go to
the year-end, so there's not really long for any impact were we to choose to commence that program, any impact would
be relatively modest.
Obviously, our guidance, as ever, is all-in but again, as I said in the prepared comments, it is, of course, assuming
current exchange rates for the balance of the fiscal year.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Ricky, it's Alex here. We are confident from an operational point of view that we
can get to that number at the end of the year and continue to drive the strategy that Stefano described so clearly. So,
you'll see through our numbers the volume in pharmacy continues to be as we expect it strong as the partnerships and
we've made a slight improvement, an important improvement, in the underlying sales growth in the frontend and the
margin in the frontend continues to be accretive year-on-year and the cost control is good. So, we remain confident that
we can get that done.
<A - Gerald Gradwell>: If I could just again ask people to speak up and speak clearly when they're asking the
questions. We can't answer questions we can't hear properly. Thank you. Next question.

<A - Stefano Pessina>: Sorry, I would add something. What we are trying to do at the end, we said from the very
beginning our aim is to keep the adjusted operating margin as healthy as possible. And you have seen that in spite of all
the difficulties of the market, over the last year, we have been successful in doing that. And we hope that we will
continue to be able to do this. There are many ways in which you can drive the numbers and the success of a company
and we are really focused on this metric. We know that there are always additional opportunities to buy back,
additional opportunities to be more efficient, not just to cut cost for the sake of cutting cost but to be more efficient.
And so, we accept the market, it's a very challenging market. We have worked in challenging markets for decades. We
know that this will be our environment in future. And as we've done for the past, we will really strive to compensate
and to respond to the challenges of the market through other actions that we can implement and we have always
implemented successfully.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Lisa Gill>: Hi, great. Good morning and thank you. Stefano, you talked about challenges and opportunities and
talked about different new partnerships that'll come about. Obviously, there's been a lot of talk about Amazon and then
potentially getting into the pharmacy market. Do you view that as a potential opportunity to Walgreens or a potential
challenge as we move forward?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Let's say that I see everything as an opportunity and not because I am an optimist, but because
we have demonstrated in the past that we can survive in any environment. Having said so, honestly, I don't believe that
Amazon will be interested in the near future in the next few years in this market, because they have so many
opportunities around the world and in many other categories, which are much, much simpler than healthcare, which is a
very regulated business, and also it's a business which we're in an industry where the consolidation has been really
quite significant. So there is not a lot of new things that they could do. Of course they could, but not so many as they
could do in other markets. So as they are a very good team and very rational team, I believe that at the end, this will not
be their priority.
Having said so, if we were wrong and our belief was wrong, I believe that at the end of the day, we could find our role
in the new environment. We wouldn't exclude to partner with them. We wouldn't exclude to analyze the new situation
of the market and to find our place adapting ourselves. So honestly, I have seen the emotional reaction about the move
that Amazon has done with Whole Foods, but I have found this reaction, as I said, emotional and with all due respect,
not rational. Because if you analyze things coldly, you will see that this is not the best opportunity for Amazon, and you
would see that the market has changed so many times in the past, and the big players in this market have survived. So
be relaxed, we will continue to survive in any case.
<Q - Lisa Gill>: That's great. And then my second follow-up, and I agree with you and I think that a lot of
prescriptions filled today are Medicare Part D, and I think that's where my follow-up question is for Alex. As we think
about bringing on the new 2,186 stores from Rite Aid, does that help to strengthen any of your Part D preferred
networks, number one? And number two, I know it's really early to think about Part D networks, as I'm sure the
negotiations are going on right now. But do you anticipate many changes for 2018?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Thanks, Lisa. I think clearly having more pharmacies in certain markets will improve
access for Medicare D for sure, and that's something that we contemplated in terms of the partnerships we have, so it
makes us slightly more attractive. I don't think it fundamentally changes the prices paid, to be honest. It just makes us
more attractive in certain markets, or will certainly help.
In terms of the market itself, we continue to have strong partnerships, which you see that much of our volume beyond
the new partnerships with Prime and Express Scripts have been driven by Med D this year, and we continue to operate
well in that market with a target from three or four years ago. There have been some changes, and that will continue to
occur, and we'll continue to govern these changes properly to make sure that we're paying within the prices that we
think is right for the service that we provide. So we remain very confident about our position in the marketplace, very

confident about the partnerships we have, and continue to govern what we get paid as best we can under the
reimbursement pressure, as Stefano has described.
<Q - Lisa Gill>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael Cherny>: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for the details so far. So I want to dive a little bit into
further the U.S. Retail Pharmacy gross profit. As you think going forward and you talked about the reimbursement
pressures, can you maybe just qualitatively give some sense of what could be some positive contributors to gross profit
dollar growth within U.S. Retail Pharmacy? And then, versus the reimbursement change we have now, what could be
some additional headwinds that you could expect to see I guess over the next one, two, three, maybe five years even?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Michael. It's Alex here. So I think as George said in his prepared remarks, we are at
the early stages of our new relationship with Rx Alliance Walgreens Prime, and that will be accretive in terms of
dollars over time, although as we all know, specialty is a high sales and low percent margin business. But that will be
accretive, and it's a very important market in the U.S. And we're pleased with the progress made although it's very early
days in this partnership. But you would have noted that we were able to win the FEP [Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program] contract as one example of the attractiveness of this new model in the marketplace.
In terms of other gross dollar opportunities going forward, it is more difficult to see in the network side at this stage. To
be honest, there are more headwinds, as you can see in the Retail Pharmacy gross profit. As Stefano said quite clearly,
we're used to living with these headwinds. And our strategy here has been very clearly to do three things. One is to
increase our volume to make better use of our network. Secondly is to improve our buying capability, which again you
can see very clearly. And also thirdly is to really make sure that we work with other healthcare services to improve the
overall gross profit dollars we got. And the major aim of all of these activities is to make sure that we focus on the
bottom line. The operating profit at the end of the day is the thing that's most important to us.
So that's how we see it. And I think we see that continued pressure, more headwinds than tailwinds, and we continue to
work all these levers to improve our operating profit. And you've seen in this quarter we improved our operating profit
in the U.S. by just around 6% I think as one example of it.
<Q - Michael Cherny>: Excellent, thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now

<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Can you hear me? Hey, sorry. I had a phone issue there. Sorry. Hey, good morning,

FTC review of the original proposed Rite Aid merger, it's safe to say that you're now obviously pretty familiar with the

specific hot-button topics at the FTC. But when you do look at the store maps in the Rite Aid slides, it does look like
the stores you're trying to buy do still seem to have a decent amount of overlap with existing Walgreens stores, at least
on a state-by-state basis.
So I guess I'm just trying to think here. Should we assume that the new plan takes into account feedback from the FTC
such that you're highly confident in a shorter FTC review for the new asset purchase, or could this still be a battle with
the FTC even for the new plan? Thanks.
<A - Gerald Gradwell>: We actually have Marco Pagni, our internal General Counsel here, who might answer that.
Marco?
<A - Marco Pagni>: Yes, hi. Good morning. You should assume that we have taken account of specific feedback from
the agency that we have received over the last 22-odd months in formulating the store package that we have agreed
with Rite Aid. But beyond that, I wouldn't care to express any level of confidence one way or another as to how the
transaction will proceed. Obviously, the matter is before the regulator. But I can tell you that we have designed it in a
way, which has been very carefully thought through with Rite Aid and with our counsel to take account of all the
feedback that we've received during the last 22 months in a very detailed, very detailed review process.
<A - Gerald Gradwell>: Alex, do you want to comment at all on the question on the overlap and/or whatever else?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: As I said before, operationally, we really like the spread of these stores. They really
give – we get into some new markets. Locally, we are able to really intensify our presence for patients and customers in
these markets. And of course, once we get into the next phase, we'll understand more how we can really operationalize
and make the whole areas more efficient. But I think we are pleased operationally with the coverage in these new
markets.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Stefano here. As we said initially, we were thinking of buying certain stores. And after
discussing with – I did. I am talking of two years ago, of course. We decided that the best outcome for both companies
was to go to a merger. And we were thinking at that time, of course, following the advice of the specialists, that the
merger could go through without major, major issues. This has not been the case. At a certain point, we were able to
structure the deal in order to address some concerns of the FTC.
Also, this new deal has taken, as you have seen, a lot of time. And at a certain point, we have decided together with
Rite Aid to go back to the old idea and to buy a certain number of stores. Of course, in doing that, we had and we have
to take into account the needs of both companies because if Rite Aid decides to sell certain stores, they have to do it in
a way that the remaining company can be efficient and can overall take into account the money that they will receive
overall can be better than before. And from our side, we have to buy those stores, which are filling certain gap that we
have in our network, and in other cases are strengthening our position in other states.
So this has been a thoughtful, let's say, deal, as Marco said, taking into account all the objections that we could imagine
from the FTC. This is just an asset deal, but also taking into account our needs and the needs of Rite Aid, because they
have to come out from this deal as a stronger company. And we have selected a cluster of stores in certain states where
we needed them, but we could not really cover all of our gap, because this would have left Rite Aid in a situation,
which, operationally, will not be particularly efficient.
So, this is really the best possible deal between our two companies. And I strongly believe, strongly believe, that this is
a deal which is very good for us, because we get probably 70%, 80% of what we wanted as national coverage, and is
very good for Rite Aid, because as they come out from this deal as a stronger company, and with a company which can
be very efficient operationally.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay, that's helpful color. Thanks.

<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Thanks for taking the question. Just curious about also just staying with the FTC issue, and in
terms of some of the concerns they might have had leading up to today's announcement. I understand what you're
saying in terms that this is more of a simple asset deal, but if I must, you're giving them an option to buy generic drugs
through WBAD and it looks like from the Rite Aid slides for a period of 10 years. Can you talk about how the FTC
might view that kind of more strategic alliance on the purchasing side? And do you think that perhaps presents a
different kind of hindrance? Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Marco?
<A - Marco Pagni>: Charles, it's Marco Pagni here again. We're not able to comment on how the FTC may or may not
see any particular facet of this transaction. But I would say is that it's important that the Rite Aid going forward be
competitive in the market and clearly its option to join our procurement vehicle. WBAD will help it with its cost of
goods going forward, which we believe is important for its competitive position in the market. And I express no view
as to how the FTC will see that, but one could imagine that that might be important for them.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: And in any case, it's an option so they can exercise it or not, so it's not a mandatory part of the
deal.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Great. And if I could just follow up, one other question with Alex. You talked in the beginning
about stores with the new beauty differentiation having doing better. Can you give us a sense in terms of comparison to
the stores that have not had the restructuring in that sense? What the differential in performance might be?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Alex?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Charles. I think as we see, they're doing markedly better, I particularly expect in
beauty. And it's definitely driving the beauty category very well in these stores. So, we are pleased with the
performance of beauty. It's really coming through quite strongly. You can imagine that beauty is still a relatively, I
wouldn't say small, but it's not as bigger part of our business. For example, as a consumable side of our business, where
we are continuing to refocus on more profitable promotions and refocus on seasonal lines, which end-to-end actually
was just money taken out from our ranges.
So I think you have to look at the whole mix. So, we are very confident. That's why we're rolling to another 1,000
stores. We're also very confident in our partnerships with other companies. For example, NYX has been rolled out. It's
a L'Oreal brand. It's a very good brand rolling out right now as well into the beauty differentiated stores, and we
continue to see a lot of customers signing up to our beauty enthusiast cards. So, again, it's the whole model that's
driving forward. And we continue to see the growth coming in beauty that we had hope to see. And so that's where we
are, and I think obviously we'll have more news as we get deeper into the States, and as we get more brands and more
beauty customers getting more interested in doing more of their beauty shopping in Walgreens.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thank you. Stefano, I want to return to your comment on this transaction being more attractive
than the original deal. If we look at the cost per store, it's much lower. That would seem to be a clear benefit. The
amount of debt you'll issue, and I'd be curious to what extent the fact that you have lower leverage and your ability to
execute on the strategies that come next plays a role in that observation that it's more attractive.
And then last, as we look at, I think you said recently 70% to 80% of national coverage. How much of the benefit is
achieved via coverage and the ability to offer your partners more coverage versus the density needed to obtain
operating efficiencies and synergies from the stores?

<A - Stefano Pessina>: On the deal, yes, I said that this is a more attractive deal not because the other deals were bad,
the other deals were good and we believed in the other deals, but of course after we have to make a lot of compromises.
And at the end of the day, the deals were different from the deals that we had in mind. So this deal it's much simpler.
It's an asset deal so it's less controversial, much less controversial. We don't take practically any liability. You can
imagine that as a part of the deal, we have the stock. And we have the tax savings that we will find amortizing the
goodwill at least cash wise.
If you think that the amortization of the goodwill is on 2,200 pharmacies practically ended the day. The inventory is on
2,200 pharmacies plus quite big warehouses. You will see that we have a strong cash element in these deals already
there. So, it's clear that economically thinking of their IRR, this deal it's very good.
On the other side, this is not a bad deal, I believe. Not at all. It's a good deal also for Rite Aid because at the end, at the
end, we don't have to give any part of the value to third parties so in reality, the two parties are better off.
And about our coverage. Well, it's very important to have a complete coverage. We were relatively weak on these
costs. So this was our main objective, particularly in the Northeast because it's a very rich region and it's a region where
it's relatively easy to work. So this was our main thoughts. Would we like to have if you want us to move on the West
Coast? Yes, of course, we would like it even though we are present there, but there are certain spots, Southern
California and maybe the state of Washington where we would like to have more stores. But at the end of the day, our
presence there is already better than the presence that we had in the Northeast.
So if we had to choose, by far we prefer to be stronger now and very present in the Northeast. Even because, as you
know, California is not an easy state for us and for everybody to work in the health care. So I believe that we are very
happy with what we have achieved. And it's important to have this coverage because it's important to be able to offer a
wide coverage to our customers. And it's also important for us because we have a better basis to amortize our cost and
we have a better basis to sell our products. Alex?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Eric. On this point of coverage being operating efficiencies, it's both. But I would
say there's probably more on the operating efficiency side. Again, if you think of what we've achieved with Walgreens
and also think of the ambition, as Stefano described very well in an earlier question, to simplify and make the front end
more efficient and more differentiated. Once we have done that in the first phase of IT simplicity, we'll be able to plug
in all these stores into that platform. So I think there's a lot to go at in the operating efficiency, probably more than the
coverage side in reality.
<Q - Eric Percher>: So that said, George, I'm surprised there's not more than modest accretion. Are you assuming any
inventory write-downs or other elements that will weigh on that and how should we think about the synergy buckets
here?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: I think in terms of the accretion, what we said is modest accretion in the first full
year. And I think that's important to take away and we're very clear on the synergies that we can deliver of the $400
million over three to four years. We've got a very clear path to delivering it. I think one of our approaches to acquisition
and integration is one where have very detailed plans. We've taken in a very structured way so that we do things
smoothly. We are going to be, obviously, actually acquiring those stores over a period of time as we've explained in the
announcement. And then we will be rebranding those over time to Walgreens bringing in the Walgreens offer, and that
is not something that we would ever dream of actually of big banging.
We need to do it properly so that we have the customer proposition is delivered in a consistent way as we do the
rebranding. So we're very confident about the returns. But what's important is to go in a straight line and do it in a way
where we keep the focus on the customer as we integrate the business and the service that we provide our patients,
rather than sometimes what you see – I've seen other businesses do where they rush things and they don't execute
properly. And I think you will have seen that consistently as with the merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots. I think
you'll see we've got a very clear track record of doing that over time.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: And you see the main important thing looking at the accretion is that we will ramp up over
time the transfer of the stores. And in the first year, we will have – it will be the – at a certain extent, the most

complicated year because we will have to start to do this, this transfer. And we have said that the transfer will take a
certain, probably two, three years, if we want to do it in an orderly fashion, if you want to do it without interruption, if
we want to keep the value of what – at the end, we will have both, we have to do like that.
On the synergies. We have said that we would have at least $400 million of synergies. Of course, as you know and as
we have always done in the past, when we give a number for the synergies, we've taken into account all the elements
we are practically sure or very, very confident. But over time, the experience tells us that we find other synergies. And
as you have seen, we have in the past at least we have exceeded what we were expecting because we cannot see all the
potential synergies today until we don't understand exactly the nature of the stores that we will have bought. Remember
that for the time being, we don't have the full set of numbers about – on those stores. And so we cannot see exactly
which kind of synergies we can achieve, and we have just taken the basic synergies we are quite confident about.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Great. Thanks for the questions. Alex, just wanted to go back to the U.S. business – and
I know this was the same case last quarter. But can you just help us understand a little bit better how despite the really
strong script growth you've seen the last two quarters that gross profit dollars were actually down again in the U.S.
business? And I guess more importantly, is there a time table that you're thinking about as far as an inflection in gross
profit dollar growth in the U.S. business?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Robert. It's Alex here. Yes. I think all the drop year on year, as George said in his
prepared remarks, about 100 basis points was due to specialty. So therefore the trend on the two quarters, as you
pointed out, is about the same – a little bit worsening but not significantly worse. And as I said already in another
remark, we are really focused on operating margin, so therefore, we drive operating margin by driving volume through
the primarily fixed cost base. And again, I want to – a big callout to our teams who've handled that volume and the cost
base, as you see, has been almost flat in reality, giving us 6% more growth in the U.S.A. in this quarter.
So I think that's the model that we spoke about before; that's the model we're now executing, recognizing as I said,
consistently the reimbursement pressure is real. And what's driving really is market conditions, the consolidation really
of the PBMs in particular. The downward pressure on pricing, and that's a real effect that we're seeing with less
inflation on branded drugs and that's clearly a feature of the marketplace this year in particular. And we continue to see
that going forward. Now we're used to this, as Stefano said and we're used to managing it in a certain way. And we're
pleased with the progress of the cost of goods that we've had.
Organization continues to perform well for us and we've set a new partnership there with Express we announced in
May. We continue to work on the cost base and the structure of the company and, as Stefano said already, we're
moving into the phase two there and we have more opportunity there. And we continue to work in partnership to make
sure that we get the volume in to that fixed cost base in the future. So that's our focus. It would be wrong of me to tell
you that I see a time in the future when I see the reimbursement pressure going away from its current levels. The
market is the market, and we are operating effectively within that marketplace.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Okay, that's fair. And then I guess, George, if you look at where the company will be
post this transaction, I think it looks like maybe somewhere in the 3.5 times leverage ratio on a rent-adjusted basis,
factoring the buyback as well. Can you just maybe share what the long-term leverage target is that you're comfortable
with post the transaction?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: We've not published a long-term leverage target. We've chosen, as you know,
Robert, to talk about our commitment to solid investment-grade, and that's very much what our policy is. Because of
the time it's taken since the original announcement of the original Rite Aid transaction, we've obviously been building
up a lot of cash, which is not something that we like doing. We're very committed to having an efficient balance sheet,

but we've had to do that. And that's why today when we've announced the new transaction, we've in parallel announced
the $5 billion share buyback program. So we're very committed to being financially disciplined.
When we're looking at M&A, we're always very focused on the numbers. If the numbers don't add up, don't meet our
investment hurdles, then we're very disciplined. We don't do transactions. And so we're very happy to grow organically
and invest to do M&A when we get the right returns, but equally a very clear policy of returning any surplus funds to
shareholders within those parameters that I've explained, having an efficient balance sheet very important to us.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Great, thanks so much.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Bryan Ross>: Hi. This is Bryan Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. Congrats on the record script growth again for the
second consecutive quarter. My question is more when you're looking at these retail pharmacy contracts and the
networks as they come up and keeping in mind your goal to continue boosting volume through the stores, do you get
the sense that conversations with health plans and payers are shifting more to these preferred networks like Prime and
TRICARE? And are you actively pursuing these types of networks moving forward?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Bryan. It's Alex. I would say it's mixed. I think first of all, nothing has
fundamentally changed year on year in the marketplace, from what we're seeing. Some payers prefer preferred
networks and some prefer to have open access across the networks. So I don't think there's anything fundamentally
changing. There's certainly a trend towards more preferred networks over time, but that's not accelerated or decelerated.
And we play in the marketplace. We look at every partnership to understand what the payer requires of us and what we
can bring to them. And then we work out through the governance processes, which are very tight in the business, what
is it that we expect to be paid in the current marketplace for the services that we provide. So that's how we see it. And
it's very active for us. It's a very important part of our business, and we try very deeply to understand what the
marketplace and what the payers want from us. And we're not trying to drive in any direction. We try and drive
customer care and access, and that's really our strategy.
<Q - Bryan Ross>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. I just wanted to poke on a couple things. Actually, I wanted a clarification and
then I want poke on a couple things. So I think it was referenced that there was a change in a post-retirement benefit
that benefited costs. If you guys could tell us how much that was and whether that's one time, that would be really
helpful?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: I'll try and answer. The post-retirement change is one of a number of changes that
we're doing as we look to make sure that we have a clear remuneration policy for all our employees, and this was the
change that affected a relatively small population of employees. So it's really part of an ongoing program. We're very
focused on all aspects of compensation as well as all aspects of our cost base. You'll see when the 10-Q comes out later
today that there is a change in the provision of $109 million, so you'll see that number in the detail of the 10-Q.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So $109 million, is that ongoing or is that a one-time benefit for the quarter?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: There's a $109 million change in the provision. But clearly in terms of the benefit
going forward, there will be a benefit going forward in relation to this. But clearly, we've been doing a lot of work on
looking at our base remuneration for our employees in our stores, so we're seeing rising costs in those areas for all the

right reasons.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. Then the second thing I wanted to talk about, obviously, with the deal that's been
announced, I was just going through some of our HHI analysis from back when you guys did the original deal. And I'm
just kind of curious. Salisbury, Maryland, the HHI index goes almost close to 4,000. And I assume that's maybe one of
the markets – there are other markets that jump well into the 3,000s. I'm just trying to get my arms around why this isn't
going to be a problem. It seems to me a lot of these markets, you look at a Buffalo, New York, you look at some of
these markets, the HHI indexes go really high.
<A - Marco Pagni>: Yes, Scott. Hi, it's Marco again.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hi.
<A - Marco Pagni>: HHI index, Herfindahl index is a pretty old technology for the FTC, so I'm not sure they're
particularly focused on that as a measure at all. And as I said before, we spent 22 months with the agency. We have a
pretty clear idea as to where they're concerned about overlaps and where they're not.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So like a Bangor, Maine, where you're going to be 60% share, they're not concerned on that?
<A - Marco Pagni>: As I said, Scott, we're pretty sure that we understand where they're concerned and where they're
not.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. Then my final question just has to do with something that came up earlier in the call,
just in transitioning from streamlining the operation to transforming it, and then looking at the pressure on gross profit
dollars. How should we look at your earnings or your EBIT algorithm in the U.S. as we move out over the next year or
two? It seems like it's going to struggle to grow, but I wanted to get your take on that, and then I'll yield. Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: As we have said many, many times, we are not living in an environment where we will see a
lot of growth, and particularly where we will see gross margin going up. We accept this, and we work on other part of
the business, on other elements of the profit and loss in order to compensate for it. This is what we are trying to do,
what we have done, and what we will continue to do.
So if you want to say that there are in this market certain headwinds, of course there are, but this is the nature of the
business. And we have to cope with it, and we have to work on the elements that are available to us and the levers that
are available to us to compensate for it, which we have done until now and we will continue to do.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Thanks very much, guys.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Thanks for taking my question. I know earlier you had talked about the deal closing
a lot of gaps in your coverage. But do you have plans to divest or close any of those stores you're planning to acquire to
improve efficiency of stores where there is significant overlap?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Listen, when we will see exactly the situation of each store, we will take the decision of what
to do. What is important to say is that in what we have said in the $400 million of synergies that we have given you, we
have not taken into account the benefit that we could have from the rationalization of the network. Something will be
there for sure, but we cannot give you an indication because we need to see the details of each single store. Alex?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: That's correct, Stefano. So I think there's nothing in the plan to do rationalization, but
obviously we'll study the situation very carefully when we get to the right point in the process and then we'll update
you. It's as simple as that. We understand that model very well from within Walgreens where we've been rationalizing
some stores in some markets, so we have a very clear model we use to assess the opportunity.

<A - Stefano Pessina>: And in any case, this will be a plus of the deal. For the time being, we are not taking it into our
numbers. We will see as soon as we will be able to take a decision, to take a thoughtful decision.
<A - Gerald Gradwell>: Thank you. We probably have time for one more question. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is
now open.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: So I guess for Alex, the simplification program, if you can, dive into that a little more deeply.
Is that solely SKU rationalization? Is it also process improvement, labor hours?
And then as it relates to SKU rationalization, is the idea that on certain – take food for example, that you cut back more
deeply in something that's more convenience-driven that you're not necessarily known for? Is that a bigger target than I
imagine it would be than OTC, HBA, those core categories?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Thanks, John. I think, again, we're very rational with this. We have the data now for 4
to 5 years of what's in customers' baskets, and we're using that data to understand exactly where we should cut the tail.
And the stores we're going to first of all are our lowest volume stores that we're looking at from a very local point of
view. So that's the first thing I would say.
The second thing I would say about this is that it really is about taking the workload out of our stores so that our
colleagues can spend more time with customers and reaches of course store hours as appropriate what the workload
suggests. We have a very, very complicated operating model; very many – a lot of many promotions, which in these
less intense stores don't sell, causing a lot of excess working capital and sometimes loss in the business as well. So the
focus really is simply on making the store easier to shop, making it clear to shop, reducing workloads and making sure
there's more hours available within that store for customer care.
And we're going through the first 1,500 stores having done some tests and trials, because these are the stores where
there is least risk to sales and lots more we can learn as we accelerate that process going forward.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: And then just as a follow-up to that, you talk about, you know, the format is obviously very
promotional. So what would you like to do over time? Would you like to dial back the promotions? I don't know if the
format will ever work in a quasi-EDLP approach, but dial back the promotions. And then if you think about
personalizing circulars, what does that do to the ebbs and flows of product demand? Would that help you with respect
to taking out or smoothing out labor in the stores?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yes, I think as I've said already, I'll go back to the point that it is very promotional, far
too promotional. We don't think it's good for us. It's not good for customers. And we don't think it's actually good for
suppliers either. So we believe much more in a consumption-driven model, and that's where we're heading to.
Also, as customers change, more and more in the future, we'll use personalization and digital marketing more than the
circular to understand what Walgreens can do for them. And we've got a mature digital organization for a retailer as
you know, and we're making moves now to really shift the spend over time in marketing towards digital and
personalization.
So all these things are true, John, and it's an evolution of the model and we're really accelerating it. But based on fact,
based on data, and we're really making strong moves in the next 18 months as Stefano said to do that. And then we
have the systems coming in in phase three to really sustain that move and accelerate it further. So we've been running
for two or three years. We're very confident that we now know the approach we have to do and we're now taking the
steps to get on with it.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. And that's all we have time for. So thank you very much, indeed, for everyone participating. Obviously, if
there's any further questions, I know we didn't have time to address all the questions, the IR team are roundabout and
available and please bear with us if it takes us a lot to get back to you. We do have quite a lot of questions already
queued up to get through, so. But thank you very much, indeed, and we'll look forward to speaking to you all again
with our full year or fourth quarter. Thank you.
