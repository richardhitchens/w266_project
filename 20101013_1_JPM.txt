MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase's third quarter 2010 earnings call. This call is
being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We are now going live to the presentation. Please
stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief
Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go ahead.
Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, operator. It's Doug Braunstein. I'm going to be taking you through the earnings presentation, which is available
on our website. We'll take questions after walking through the presentation. One final note, there's a slide in the back of
the presentation regarding forward-looking statements. Please read it.
With that, let me move to page one. We generated $4.4 billion in net income, $1.01 per share on revenues of $24.3
billion. We're highlighting three items here that relate to significant changes in our reserve positions in the quarter.
First, as you know, we released reserves in the Card Services representing $0.22 a share of an increase to earnings. In
the Corporate sector, we increased our litigation expense through increasing our reserve, and that reduced earnings by
$0.18. And in RFS, we booked an increase in our mortgage repurchase reserves. That reduced earnings about $0.15,

and that obviously runs through as a contra-revenue item.
Broadly as you look down, we had solid results in our businesses but I'm going to cover those specifically when we talk
about the specific businesses on the following pages. One final note on page one, Tier 1 common at the bottom of the
page, about – a little under $111 billion in the quarter, that's up $3 billion quarter on quarter.
I've covered much of the important information on page two, so let's move to page three, the Investment Bank; circled
net income of 1.3 billion on revenues of 5.4 billion, IB fees in the quarter 1.5 billion. We continue to be ranked number
one in fees, but markets there remain highly competitive. The results demonstrate some particular strength in our Debt
Capital Markets businesses as well as our Asian Investment Banking businesses. And you'll see in the back on page 19
very strong league table results.
Fixed income revenue was 3.1 billion for the quarter. That's down year on year on lower volumes and tighter spreads.
However, if you look quarter to quarter and you exclude the negative impact of DVA, which was 150 million in this
quarter, and that DVA reflects the credit spread tightening on our structured notes versus a benefit of 400 million in
second quarter, revenues are actually up modestly quarter on quarter, largely consistent volumes and spreads from our
client businesses.
In Equity Markets, revenues were 1.1 billion, up year on year and quarter on quarter; very solid client revenues in our
Global Equities business that was offset by declines in Prime Services as lower spreads continued to offset actually
higher balances we had in the quarter. The quarter results for equities includes DVA impact of a negative $100 million
this quarter versus a $200 million benefit we highlighted in 2Q.
A word on credit, you'll see credit costs were favorable, 142 million benefit, as we released reserves in the quarter. Net
charge-offs, however, are at 25 basis points, and that continues to reflect what we've talked about, which is
strengthening of corporate balance sheets across our client base.
Expenses in the quarter of 3.7 billion, that's down both quarter on quarter and year over year. That's largely a function
of lower base performance-based comp as well as the impact of the UK bonus tax charges we took in the second
quarter. And comp to revenue was 38% in the quarter for the Investment Bank.
On page four, let's spend a moment on RFS. At the top of the page, you'll see circled net income of 900 million. That's
on $7.6 billion worth of revenue. I want to focus in on the three component businesses. Retail Banking, which you
know is our branch and deposit taking businesses, had 848 million of net income in the quarter. $4.4 billion worth of
revenue; revenues are down year over year. That's principally driven by the NSF/OD fee changes in 2010. They're fully
reflected in this quarter versus a 50% impact in second quarter.
That reduction was offset by a number of positives in the quarter, including an improved deposit margin, as well as we
continue to increase our branch footprint, ATM footprint, an increase in the number of checking accounts in the
quarter, and a number of other positive production metrics you can see on the next page.
Expenses are up in the quarter slightly. That's largely a function of our continuing investment in our sales force and our
distribution business as we continue to add bankers and specialists in the branches.
Mortgage Banking and other consumer lending, which is in the middle of the page, which reports our mortgage loan
origination, our servicing activity, auto, and our other consumer lending businesses, earned $200 million in net income
for the quarter, 1.9 billion of total revenues. And that really included very strong Mortgage Banking revenue of 2.5
billion in the quarter. That's before considering repurchase reserves, which I'll talk about in a moment. That was largely
driven by higher mortgage origination, $41 billion in the quarter, up 27% quarter over quarter.
Loan repurchase expense was 1.5 billion in the quarter, and that negatively impacts the revenue line as a contra-revenue
item, as you recall. We increased reserves in the quarter $1 billion, and that's largely based on the continuation of a
high level of requests for loan files from the GSEs [Government Sponsored Entities] as well as repurchase demands. As
a result of that increase, total reserves are now at $3 billion for this category.

In addition, our realized losses for settled claims rose in the quarter as well, and that's largely because we're working on
working down our aged claim inventory. Going forward, we think our realized repurchase losses, what would be the
functional equivalent of charge-offs, are going to remain high in 2011, and we've guided you to $1 billion plus or
minus. But eventually as we work through bad vintages, we would expect those actual costs to come down.
Other expenses in this category are up 21% year over year, and that largely reflect higher default related costs. And one
other note here, our auto business had very strong earnings, credit improvement, lower delinquencies, and a continued
strength in our used car values all contributed to that.
Finally at the bottom of the page, real estate portfolios experienced a loss of 148 million in the quarter. Revenues,
which are principally NII, are down 18%, and that's largely consistent with the runoff in our balances quarter on quarter
and year over year. And credit costs, which I'll spend time on page six, really a function of net charge-offs this quarter,
declined to $1.2 billion.
So what I'd like to do is skip page five. I've covered much of that information. I'll talk a little bit about Home Lending
on page six, and let's focus first on the circled numbers. Reduction in our total home lending net charge-offs in the
quarter; we went to 1.2 billion from 1.34 billion in 2Q. And if you look at appendix slide 17, which is our normal chart
showing our delinquency trends, you'll see that the curve has essentially remained flat across the categories through the
third quarter, and that's the same trend we talked about in May and June of 2Q. In addition to that, HPI home prices
remain stable. And as a result, loss severities remained stable in the quarter as well.
So if you look at these numbers, and you remember that losses lag new delinquencies by approximately five months,
what you see reflected in this quarter really is the benefit of the delinquency reductions that we saw in the first four
months of 2010. And if delinquencies remain flattish, which they have for the past five months, you'd expect to see our
losses going forward flatten out as well.
Bearing that in mind, if you look at the right side of the page, right, you'll see that our loss guidance for the quarter
remains unchanged at 1.8 billion. Now if you take our run rate over the last two quarters and you were to annualize
that, we'd have a run rate of about $5 billion to $5.2 billion. We have reserves, as you know, in this category of 11.3
billion. Those remained unchanged during the quarter. And the reason we're keeping both our reserves and our
guidance where they are is that there is continuing economic and housing market uncertainty, and we want to reflect
that in those two numbers.
Finally, the WaMu PCI position, which is at the bottom right of the page, you'll notice we haven't changed our
allowances or our existing marks. Remember, these are lifetime estimates, and so they include some assumptions about
the future improvements in both our trends for delinquencies and severities. And we do note at the bottom here that if
delinquencies and severities remain flat for a two-year period that we would have to add incrementally 3 billion plus or
minus to our reserves.
Page seven, Credit Card business, at the top of the page, net income of 735 million on revenues of 4.3 billion; credit
cost is a big story for the business this quarter, total costs of 1.6 billion in 3Q. We had a $1.5 billion pre-tax reduction
in our loan loss reserves. That largely reflects a lower estimate of future losses, and it's really based on the two numbers
circled at the bottom of the page. Our charge-off rate went to 8.06 for the Chase portfolios excluding WaMu. That's
down almost 100 basis points quarter over quarter. Thirty-plus day delinquencies declined 35 bps to 4.13. One final
note, our absolute dollar of charge-offs continue to remain very high, $3.1 billion in the quarter versus 3.7 in 2Q.
I want to spend a moment here on outlook for where we are on net charge-off rates. We gave you prior guidance this
past month that we believe net charge-off rates will decline in 4Q another 50 basis points to 7.5% plus or minus, and
we're maintaining that guidance.
The revenue line, just spend one more moment there. 4.3 billion in revenues is down quarter on quarter and year on
year. That's largely a function of lower outstandings. That includes our WaMu portfolio runoff as well as lower balance
transfers, which we talked about last month. EOP balances for the quarter are down 7 billion and almost 29 billion year
over year. Revenues are also down because of the impact of the CARD Act. The run rate this quarter is about 65% of
the total guidance we gave you of $750 million in net income. That's up from a 25% run rate in 2Q.

Now on the positive side, I would note that sales volume for our Chase portfolio is up almost 8% year over year, 2%
quarter on quarter. It means people are taking their Chase cards out of their wallet and using them.
Net interest margin at the bottom of the page, up 50 basis points quarter on quarter; that largely reflects a lower level of
fee reversals as our credit trends continue to improve, some runoff of some introductory balances, and then a favorable
mix in our loan balances.
One other word here on balances and outlook, we're guiding towards year-end balances of $123 billion for the Chase
portfolio. That's down 15% year over year, and that's a function of both charge-offs as well as our pullback in our
balance transfer business. Receivables in this category we'd expect to bottom out in Q3 2011 and end the year in 2011
plus or minus 120 billion. The WaMu portfolio we'd expect to decline at the end of 2011 to 10 billion. It began 2010 at
20. We're down to 14.5 billion as of Q3.
Page eight, the Commercial Bank, overall a strong result for the Commercial Bank, net income of 470 million, up a
little under 40% year over year; revenues of 1.5 billion is a record for the Commercial Bank this quarter, and it reflects
a number of very positive outcomes. Gross investment banking fees in the quarter were a record revenue. We acquired
a $3.5 billion CTL, Commercial Term Lending portfolio in the quarter. We continue to build out our footprint of
bankers in the WaMu states, and that has developed into attractive business with new customers. And our liability
balances ended the quarter at $138 billion.
The other circled numbers here on the page are loan balances of $98.1 billion. If you exclude the acquisition impact,
they're essentially flat, but we do see some signs of activity. We've had an increase actually in our loan balances in the
middle market, up $900 million quarter on quarter. And that's the first time in many quarters we have seen growth
there. Some of that is our existing customers; much is new customers. We added almost 500 customers in the quarter in
the middle market. Our utilization rates, however, still remain in the low 30s.
Credit costs of 166 million in the quarter largely reflect an increase in charge-offs in our commercial real estate
segment. You'll see net charge-off rate here of a little under 90 basis points, 89 basis points. Commercial real estate
represents about 80% of the net charge-off rate. That's versus 62% in 2Q. And we would expect to see continued
pressure going forward from commercial real estate. But remember, our commercial real estate balances are not a
significant component of the total portfolio.
Page nine, Treasury & Securities Services, circled net income here of 250 million in the quarter; that's down slightly
from last year and last quarter. I would say that the story for TSS remains essentially the same for the second quarter.
We have the slow rate environment. It continues to pressure our revenues across both WSS [Worldwide Securities
Services] and TS. And that's coupled with some incremental investments we've been taking, and that's reducing our
margin over the near term.
Revenues of 1.8 billion were up modestly year over year, down modestly quarter on quarter.
And expenses you'll note are up $130 million year over year. And so just a moment to remind everyone, we continue to
make investments in this platform in our Global Corporate Bank, our international branch network, our international
product capabilities, incremental product expansions, and other platform spending. One other final note, TSS here had a
$1 trillion increase in assets under custody quarter over quarter.
Asset Management on page 10, circled net income of $420 million, revenues in the quarter 2.2 billion, up both year
over year and quarter on quarter, and that's based on a number of factors. We had a continuing increase in fund flows in
the quarter, almost $38 billion. That included $27 billion into liquidity products, which is our first positive quarter in a
year. We had 11 billion of flows into long-term products, which are higher margin. And that's the sixth consecutive
quarter of positive inflows there, and largely all of that is based on continued strong investment performance. We also
had revenues up on higher market levels. And we also in the quarter saw significant increase in our mortgage
production in Asset Management.
Expense growth here, if you look year over year, was up $137 million, again a story of continued investment for
long-term growth. We're hiring front office folks, so our Private Banking advisors were up 17% year over year, and a

larger percentage of that internationally. We continue to invest in technology here, particularly in the Private Bank, to
improve both the speed and the efficiency of those platforms.
Page 11 is Corporate and Private Equity. You'll note here we had very strong Private Equity this quarter, $344 million
of net income impact after all the expenses. And just a word of caution, Private Equity, the results here can be volatile
quarter on quarter. They vary both based on timing of realizations, the market values of our public positions, and so
that number will move quarter on quarter.
Corporate net income, $4 million, is down significantly quarter over quarter, down significantly year over year, and
that really reflects three things: one, reduced net income, net interest income in the quarter; second, lower security
gains in the quarter; and then third, we increased our expenses in the quarter. And that includes 1.3 billion pre-tax
increase in our litigation reserve and that litigation reserve includes items related to mortgages. We aren't going to
spend a lot more time discussing that particular topic on the call.
And the final note of guidance here is that there will be periodic items that affect the Corporate line. We still believe
the net income number should be trending over time plus or minus $300 million when you exclude Private Equity.
Page 12, focus on the balance sheet for a moment, strong results here. Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 common both grew, 139
billion and 111 billion respectively. RWA total assets were actually up modestly in the quarter. And our Tier 1 ratios
continued to remain very strong. The absolute levels are higher in both Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common, but there was
a modest decline in the ratio this quarter, and that largely reflects the increased level of repurchase activity. We bought
back approximately 2.2 billion shares in the – $2.2 billion, thank you, Jamie. And we continue to buy back shares to
offset our equity issuance to employees.
Credit reserves remain very strong at 35 billion, and there are details in the back on that.
And then just one comment, we've added a new disclosure item here, the global liquidity reserve, which is 272 billion.
The details of that are in a footnote, but I would just note that outside of the details in the footnote, the firm has a
number of other significant highly marketable liquidity positions in marketable securities, corporates, equities, that
aren't included in that number. And all in all, we continue to think we have very strong balance position.
Page 13, outlook, I think I covered all of that.
So what I'd like to do finally is spend a moment and comment on the mortgage affidavit issue. We're not going to say
too much about this today other than the comments that we're giving you here because we're really at the beginning of
this process, but I can share some information with you, so let's turn to page 14.
We've identified issues relating to the mortgage foreclosure affidavits, and those include signers not having personally
reviewed the underlying loan files, but instead having relied upon the work of others. Those others, Chase employees,
did conduct reviews of the underlying loan files. And there are circumstances where affidavits have not been properly
notarized.
So I want to just step back and have you understand what the nature of some of the information in this affidavit relates
to. They obviously differ by jurisdiction. But in general, the type of content that we're attesting to includes: the name of
the borrower, property address, the date, whether or not the borrower has actually defaulted and if they have cured the
default, and the total amount of indebtedness.
As a result of these actions, we're reviewing 115,000 plus or minus loan files that are currently in the foreclosure
process. And we'll do the following based on that review, either refile the affidavits where appropriate. As you know,
we've delayed our foreclosure sales. And so to the extent we can, we'll reinitiate those when appropriate. And we're
also in the process of putting additional processes in place to make sure on a go-forward basis, we fulfill all the
procedural requirements. Obviously, the company takes these matters very seriously, and we're devoting substantial
resources to the issue.
On page 15, what you'll see at the top headline is really all of these processes are really designed to avoid foreclosure if
possible. And what we would say today is say based on the processes, which I'll describe in a moment, and the reviews

we've done to date that we believe the underlying foreclosure decisions were justified by the facts and circumstances.
But let me give you a little more color on the actual processes we employed and why we're comfortable. If you see the
first sub-bullet point, 15 days after delinquency is when we first reach out to a customer. Following that, we will send
numerous letters. We'll make numerous phone calls. In fact, the frequency of those contacts are likely to increase as we
head towards the possibility of taking foreclosure action.
In addition to that, we added in 2009 a separate group outside of our processes to review these loans before we take
specific foreclosure actions. So that group, and you'll see an appendix slide on this, goes through a series of questions
including: have we made contact, have we pursued mitigation strategies if appropriate. And you'll see those questions
listed on page 20 of the appendix.
As a result of all those actions, since January 2009, we've prevented 429,000 foreclosures through either modifications,
short sales, or other loss mitigation actions.
And just to remind everyone, this is a very lengthy process. And so from the initial default to the actual foreclosure sale
for our serviced mortgages, that's on average 14 months in the process or 448 days. Mortgages in the state of Florida
for us, that process is 678 days. In New York, it is 792 days, more than two years. And in most if not all instances over
that period of time, no principal or interest payments have been made on the mortgage.
So I think we'd like to conclude by saying is that we really believe the proper approach and response here is to go loan
by loan, file by file, customer by customer. And if mistakes have been made, then we need to address them
individually, which we will absolutely do.
And just stepping back, obviously the housing market in the position that it's in, we'd hope that we'd be in a position to
move briskly here to avoid further damage and further pressure on the housing market, and ultimately further pressure
on the economy.
With that, I'd like to at this point open it up for questions for Jamie and I. Operator, would you please open the line?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thanks very much, first an easy one. The balance sheet went up 6% sequentially, all on the
securities side, not a big deal. Your leverage numbers are not high. I'm just curious if you have – how much wiggle
room or how much appetite do you have to continue that trend on the modest uptick in leverage there, or are you just
growing that as equity builds?
<A - James Dimon>: That decision is made all the time. It changes all the time. It's just trade exposures and what
securities you like and the timing of sales and stuff like that, so that is going to bounce around. It's not a deliberate
growth strategy in securities.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. The next one is a little different. You talked a little bit about the conference the other day,
Jamie. Mitigation techniques, in other words we know the negative side of the impact on returns and risk-weighted
assets. But on the mitigation side, you talked a little bit about repricing, but I wanted to ask you what impact can – what
I'll just sum up under Reg. R opportunities are there, meaning there are asset managers, mutual hedge funds, private
equity funds that don't have the same increase in those requirements, so are they more natural owners of some of the
assets?
And then part B of the question is what about the long-dated trades and contracts that you might have on with the rest
of the Street where both sides have the willingness to maybe tear up contracts and net things out? How much of an
impact can that have on the mitigation front?

<A - James Dimon>: You're asking a long question there. I think on the risk-weighted asset side, we talk about natural
mitigants. Things are just going to run off over time. They're actually not really actions we're taking but just
securitizations or retail loans that run off over time. Remember, we're economic animals. We're not going to sell
something that we think is a good asset with a good return because the RWA is too high relative to capital. So no one
can look at us and say we're going to have to sell something cheap to somebody else because we can't hold it. We have
plenty of capital. We can hold whatever we want. And we're going to make economic decisions, not Basel III related
decisions.
Having said that, I do think that you're going to find people, some other natural owners of certain assets that don't have
the same kind of regulatory or capital stuff. I don't think that's going to be an unbelievably material thing for us. I think
if you were in a different kind of business, it might be more material. I do agree with you. There are going to be a lot of
ways that when people really go through this, they're going to go man, a CVA/DVA contract, clearing houses, which
will diminish the RWA effect pretty dramatically over time. People will really learn how to manage it better, and we
haven't tried to do all that, and we're not worried about it because we don't really need the capital.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. So between those comments, that confidence, and the confidence on the ability to reprice,
an obvious statement, but you seem reasonably confident that you're able to earn pretty good returns in the new world?
<A - James Dimon>: We're pretty confident in the new world we'll earn good returns for shareholders. And some will
be – when you talk about reprice if you're referring to retail, it's going to take a while to design the exact products, the
exact fees, exactly when to do it. So there may be a little timing difference, which costs us more money as we design
those products and roll them out, but eventually we'll have to reprice it, yes.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John McDonald>: Yes, hi. Doug, I was wondering if you could clarify the outlook on rep and warranty that you
gave on the losses for 2010 and '11. And then in terms of the income statement impact, just wondering since this is a
lifetime reserve methodology, when would you expect to start consuming some of the reserves that you've built for the
rep and warranty or at least matching instead of building reserves here?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: So on outlook, what we said is for 2010, I think our outlook
was plus or minus 1.2 billion of expense, right? Obviously, you'll take a look at our third quarter numbers are a little
higher, and so we're likely to come in at the high end of that range.
For 2011, what we've said is $1 billion of realized repurchase losses. And what we've done is we've taken – based on
what we know, we've gone back and increased our reserves by $1 billion based on the higher file requests as well as
higher settlement demands. And where we are today, we believe we're adequately reserved based on what we know,
and we'll go back periodically and review that.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay, so the idea is you're probably not going to start consuming reserves. It is analogous to
the way you do credit reserves? Don't you have visibility that this is ending and you have a better line of sight to the
end? Is that the idea?
<A - James Dimon>: First of all, it's not lifetime losses exactly. It's more known and estimable, which extends beyond
a year in this particular case. Think of it as repurchased losses will be at 1 billion. That may go on more than a year. At
one point, you won't need the reserves and you'll start to hit the 1 billion to get to reserves. We just don't know if that's
going to be near the end of 2011 or 2012, but it will be sometime in that period. If you just look at vintages and aging
and stuff like that, eventually you won't need to reserve and the expense will go against the reserve.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay. And then, Jamie, on Basel, do you have any sense of timing of when the U.S. regulators
will be deciding on the additional buffer to be required of systemically important institutions?

<A - James Dimon>: Not specifically, they're waiting for this thing in Korea on November 20th. And then at one
point, we hope to get some guidance. In any event, we think we're in very good shape.
<Q - John McDonald>: And do you have a sense that – do you have a regulatory green light for capital management?
Do you think that banks might be given that before Basel is implemented, or is there a risk that capital return gets
delayed while they debate?
<A - James Dimon>: I think that everybody is waiting for final Basel III guidance. Remember, the regulators are
putting us through additional stress tests, and I think everyone is waiting to get that done. I'll make the same statement I
made before. I think it's reasonably hopeful that sometime in the first quarter, we can reinstall a dividend or something
like that. I think it makes sense to do. I think some banks will start retaining far too much excess capital at one point
next year.
<Q - John McDonald>: And the regulators are open to those discussions?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, they are, but they are going through their own calculations, and they obviously want to look
at the global issues I think before they make any final determinations.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay, last thing here. The net interest margin was down five basis points, a lot less of a
decline than last quarter. Do you think you've maybe seen the worst of your NIM pressure? And what are going to be
the key drivers for the top of the house NII going forward?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: I would say we're – it was down five basis points. There are a
number of factors that impact that. We're going to continue to see some pressure in Corporate for NIM. And it's hard to
predict at this point where rates are going to be and what the impact is going to be and where loan demand is going to
be on the other side of the equation. But it will be down a little bit.
<A - James Dimon>: It's going to be down a little bit next quarter.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: But it will be down a little bit next quarter.
<A - James Dimon>: Most of it's in Corporate. If you look at absolute dollars, we have a ton of portfolios.
<Q - John McDonald>: Okay. And your card NIM was up a lot this quarter. Did you comment on that, Doug, why
that went up so much this quarter?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
<Q - John McDonald>: The credit card NIM went up a lot this quarter. I was just wondering. Did you comment on
that?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, I did. That's largely a function of lower fee reversals in
the quarter and then better mix.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: First question is with regard to the net interest margin in the Corporate sector where you
added about $30 billion in securities. Based on the comments you've made, should we assume that that is extremely
liquid stuff with very low net interest margins, very low margin, low duration stuff?
<A - James Dimon>: I would assume mostly very liquid. I wouldn't assume it's all very low margin.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And duration is probably pretty short, or not so much?
<A - James Dimon>: I would say fairly short, but that moves around a lot. It may not be the same thing the next time
we talk to you.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: And I would just add. Remember that as we reposition the
portfolio, we're doing that through a quarter, so second quarter sales we had had full NIM impact in the third quarter,
for example.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And then just following up on the Basel III discussion, you had spoken recently at
length about your capital position with that approaching. But since then, we certainly have heard quite a bit from the
Swiss on this Swiss Finish issue. Scan Target is out raising capital yesterday. I'm just wondering even though you did
obviously buy back a couple billion dollars worth of stock, whether you are quite as optimistic about the potential for
capital relief going forward in light of all of that.
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, I would say the same thing. We're already very close to the 7% Basel III requirement,
which includes that buffer. I know that the Swiss Finish came in at 10, which I think is too high. Remember, if you go
back – remember, this should be consistent with stress tests. When the American government did the stress test at 4%
Basel I, it made the adjustments to cap RWA, 7% is closer to 12% Basel I. It's almost a triple of what the banks were
able to survive under, under the worst recession of all time under the stress test. So we think the seven is a very strong
number, and I personally don't think it's going to be a market. Then the Swiss Finish had another 9% for Cocos. I think
that that's extremely optimistic and almost impossible to occur. I think you've got different issues. The size of their
banks versus the size of their country, so they've got to do what they think is right for them. I would put those numbers
in the extreme category.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Those are fair points, thanks. The final one I want to ask, and I know that you don't feel like
you can say much more...
<A - James Dimon>: Can you get closer to your phone, Guy, or get off the speakerphone maybe?
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Sorry, I'm in a strange conference room with a weird setup, so I apologize. I just wanted to
dig in a little bit more of the foreclosure issues. I know you can't talk too much more about it than what you've said, but
I was wondering if you could give us any sense for timing of resolution in terms of reopening these 115,000 cases.
<A - James Dimon>: It's going to take several weeks to go through the files and make sure – and correct any errors
that are in there. Remember, we believe the underlying stuff is all accurate, okay? That's the key substance. Obviously,
we know there are a lot of state AGs. We've had conversations with them. We're hoping that the normal process – to us
the sooner the better for everybody involved. We don't think there are any cases where people have been evicted out of
homes where they shouldn't have been. These foreclosures go through multiple processes. And so we're hoping it will
be sooner rather than later, but those conversations are starting to take place.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And is it fair to assume that at least a fair portion of that litigation reserve that you added to
is specifically for this topic?
<A - James Dimon>: No, there's nothing in it for this topic. I think the way you should look at this topic is that we're
bearing today $7 billion of charge-offs, foreclosure, repurchase costs. That's ex-reserves. That 7 billion will go up or
down based upon the economy and stuff like this. I'm not sure stuff like this is going to dramatically change that
number. It may extend it a little bit longer and stuff like that. And remember we have in total between repurchase
reserves and the $11 billion – we have 14 billion of reserves for repurchases or loan losses.

And look, the mortgage thing, we're halfway through all this. We think we should continue and get done and make sure
we do the right things for the consumers, the investors, and the country. And so it obviously will increase our costs a
little bit, and maybe we'll have to pay penalties eventually to some of the AGs. But we really think we should just
continue.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - James Dimon>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: I realize you guys don't want to talk in too much detail on the litigation reserve. But just
conceptually, you've taken a little bit greater than 4 billion of reserves for litigation so far this year. And I guess a lot of
us are just having a hard time understanding what it might be for. And are you getting ahead of it or still trying to catch
up?
<A - James Dimon>: You know our society, right? You know how many lawsuits go on and class action suits and
stock drop suits and barrister suits and WaMu suits and mortgage suits, and it ain't going away. It's becoming a cost of
doing business. Yes, we always try to get ahead of it. We're not going to give you specific detail. When we're wrong,
we're going to settle. When we're right, we're going to fight. Not all those reserves are mortgage related. They were
related to other items we have to deal with as a company, and we do try to be ahead of it. We try to be very ahead of it
because we think it's the right thing to do.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, sorry to be a little nitpicky on this question, but if we look
at some of the drivers of your net interest margin, there are some of these dollar financing rolls basically causing a
negative funding cost for about 280 billion of liabilities...
<A - James Dimon>: No, for some of the liabilities, but go ahead.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Just overall it's minus 28 bps for like 280 billion and just trying to understand what that is
and what the risks are associated with that.
<A - James Dimon>: That's one of the reasons we tell you it's going to come down next quarter because we don't
necessarily expect all those favorable rolls to continue the way they've continued. But remember, we're pretty creative
in finding ways to do NII, so there are other things to buy and other things to do. We've positioned the company more
and more for raising rates, less rates. Those portfolios may come down. The benefits of rolls may go away. We don't
have to buy low duration mortgage assets. We could buy other things too.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. And obviously there's not going to be the type of extension risk on this funding side
that you would have on the asset side?
<A - James Dimon>: That's correct.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: It will just go away one day.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay, and then just separately a bigger picture question. The credit card losses for you
guys and I think for the industry overall continue to march down at a very nice pace despite very high unemployment.
Once we get to that 7.5% in the fourth quarter, do losses just flatten out at some point unless unemployment gets better,
or do you still get a continued trend down?
<A - James Dimon>: I think the likely outcome is for continued trend down. And remember in the credit card
business, those losses tend to relate more to new unemployment claims and new unemployment, not just the absolute

level, if you look through history. And also after 2.5 years, you charged off 20%, so you really have worked through a
lot of the bad accounts.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: I would add that the accounts we're obviously taking on
because we continue to grow the business have different characteristics than the accounts that we're rolling off. So the
net of the entire portfolio is a better quality portfolio.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. And it seems like you'll probably have some more reserve relief at some point. It
seems like you're still...
<A - James Dimon>: Not at some point, this is very important. We don't release reserves because we want earnings
targets or something like that. We release them because we have to. We're conservative. We fight the other way. Keep
them up, not take them down. As charge-offs come down, if they come down in credit cards, we will have to release
those reserves. I think it's a really silly pro-cyclical thing we all go do, put them them all up and take them all down,
and you all have to guess what the earnings are going to be and is it real earnings or not earnings or normalized
earnings, but they are going to have to come down.
So you can think of that right now losses normalize eventually, call it 4.5% in credit card, we will have to take down
another 4 or 5 or $6 billion of reserves. That isn't a choice. That is an absolute accounting rule. There are underlying
assumptions that go into it. It's your judgment call, and my guess is that will be happening slowly over the next six
quarters. And you'll see more rapid change if and when the economy starts to improve. The same will relate also to
mortgage losses by the way, and all other losses for that matter.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - James Dimon>: So the $35 billion of reserves, you go through your own numbers, but that's going to normalize a
lot lower than 35.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.
<A - James Dimon>: Hi, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff Harte>: Hi, good morning, guys; a couple of things. One, Capital Markets, trends as far as client risk
attitude, corporate clients' interest in raising capital for performing M&A, things like that; what kind of trends are you
seeing coming out of the summer?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Jeff, it continues to be – I'd say the big trend is you've had a
lot of companies extend maturities, reduce their cost of borrowing by going into the public markets. And so that has
been a very positive thing. And balance sheets continue to be very, very healthy. You're starting to see a pickup in the
appetite for M&A, and I think part of that is a function of people getting their balance sheets prepared and ready to go
and looking for growth. There continues to be a little more uncertainty out there about both the economy and what the
political landscape entails. And so we haven't seen a rush towards activity, but you would expect as you get clarity
there to get some real momentum behind it.
<A - James Dimon>: And the trading desks, you all looked at one month that got slow or one month that's faster, but
there has been pretty good client activity. I don't see any reason why there wouldn't be pretty good client activity.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: And I would just add across – particularly for example in
equities, we continue to invest in systems and platforms and adding to our capabilities as well. So that has been very
positive for us in this quarter.
<Q - Jeff Harte>: Okay. And non-sufficient funds or the overdraft opt-in, how successful have efforts to get people to
opt into that been?

those numbers all the time. It's going to change as people change their mind. Remember, they can at any point in time
pretty much opt in or opt out.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: And what I would say is the 700 million of guidance that we
gave you on net income, that's going to be – that's in the run rate and an accurate reflection of that.
<A - James Dimon>: The number we gave you is right for the wrong reasons.
<Q - Jeff Harte>: Okay. And the foreclosure stuff, outside of how it directly may impact you or somebody else, how
do you look at the drag it may have on the housing market, the macro impact? What do you think about that?
<A - James Dimon>: Again I hope – and this is a hope. This is not a knowledge, is that when people take a deep sigh
breath, you go back to the right, look at the substance underlying the files, and go back to modifying, foreclosing, and
doing the right thing all told, and it could be a blip. If you're talking about three or four weeks, it will be a blip in the
housing market. If it went on for a long period of time, it will have a lot of consequences, most of which will be
adverse on everybody.

<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<A - James Dimon>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Jamie, I just wanted to follow-up on the Basel III comment you made earlier. And I know you
kept your common Tier 1 pretty much flat in the quarter, and you indicated that you're not going to be making Basel III
related decisions. I guess I'm just wondering. Are you managing capital? You're comfortable obviously with where it is
today. Is that what we should be expecting going forward? And when Basel III starts to kick in, you start to...
<A - James Dimon>: We're completely covered with capital. I think we showed you a number that in 2013 when Basel
III starts to roll in, we will have under even adverse circumstances like 11 or 12 – it's a huge number. I've got the...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: The net number was 11.
<A - James Dimon>: It rolls it over five years or something like that. So we have lots of capital, and so we're really not
managing capital or RWA as much as we're just trying to build the business: clients, branches, brokers, traders,
salesmen, and we have plenty of capital to grow the business in an intelligent way. A lot of those numbers we showed
at the Barclays presentation, they were not heroic. They were just runoff with basic stuff we know about. I do think
people do a much tighter job imagining those things if and when it becomes important.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: I would just add, we raised year to date between our new
loans, re-ups, Capital Markets. We raised almost $1 trillion for our clients across all these platforms. We continue to
put our balance sheet to work for our clients, and we're anxious to do so. We've got plenty of capacity there.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: So Basel III related decisions don't kick in until it actually comes into effect in '13?

between 2013 and full phase by '18.

number would be when we know what the final rules are. And my guess is we'll be compliant with whatever the
number is sometime next year.

wanted to.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: 10% on...
<A - James Dimon>: We can get to 10% Basel III next year, if we desired. We'd have to make some tougher decisions
to sell things and stop doing a bunch of stuff. But if that's what we wanted to do, we could do it.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Basel III common Tier 1, 10%?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: By the end of next year without raising any equity?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, we can do a lot of different stuff. People are going to make decisions to get compliant
quicker than people think. That's what's going to happen in the marketplace.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: So just one other question on capital usage. We talked about the divi. What about the possibility
for M&A? A tough one under the curve environment; are you more incented to do M&A?
<A - James Dimon>: I always feel good that we don't have to do M&A, that we just grow our businesses and do a
great job for our shareholders. We're going to generate a lot of excess capital. And of course we can talk of businesses
or buy back stock or do M&A. We're open-minded to M&A if there is something that made sense. And we're always
looking for bolt-ons and adds in all of the businesses, and so we'd be open.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: And what would make sense now?
<A - James Dimon>: I can't tell you that. You're thinking about Morgan – the other Morgan.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Thanks.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: We're going to obviously just – we're going to remain

<Q - Edward Najarian>: Most of my questions have been answered, but just two more quick ones. Jamie or Doug, do
you want to provide any color on the pace of the buyback over the next couple of quarters? Should we expect around 2
billion in near-term quarters to be a consistent trend? I guess that's question number one and then I'll ask the second
one.
<A - James Dimon>: I'm not going to give you an answer about next quarter. But I think at one point going forward
when everything clarifies around Basel, we could be an aggressive buyer of our own stock if we think the price is
cheap. We're not going to do it at any price. We're not like everybody else. At a low price we'd do it. At high prices we
don't. And as you know, we have plenty of capital generation. So if that's what makes the most sense for shareholders,
you can assume that's what we're going to do. At a minimum as a discipline, we like to buy back what we issue. That
does not mean every week we buy back what we issued that week. It means that generally in the course of a year, we
like to do that at a minimum.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: That number is plus or minus around 3 billion for 2010.
<Q - Edward Najarian>: Okay. And with your stock in the low 40s, should we think about fully diluted shares
outstanding shrinking by some amount in 2011?
<A - James Dimon>: We're just not going to tell you what we're going to do with our stock. I mean, we're just not. We
look out looking a couple years how much capital, what the options are, what makes the most sense for shareholders.
<Q - Edward Najarian>: Okay. And then in prior conferences and presentations, you've talked a lot about different
pieces of the loan portfolio that will shrink, and we don't need to go through all that again. But I guess could you give
some kind of an outlook three quarters out, four quarters out? When do you think we'll get to that crossover point
where the loan portfolio or loans outstanding stabilizes and then maybe starts to grow a little bit? When do you hit that
inflection point?
<A - James Dimon>: I think it bounces all over the place. Commercial Bank, we're starting to see signs of life, and
maybe we'll start to see growth in the next three to six months. Credit Card, it will bottom out we think in the third
quarter of next year. That includes the runoff and all the other stuff. Treasury, Asset Management, we've actually had
loan growth. Treasury is trade finance. We expect maybe to see both. And in consumer, auto generally you would
expect to see growth, and the big one is the 200 billion runoff of stuff, a lot of which was acquired from WaMu. That
will be running off for years.
<Q - Edward Najarian>: Right. So it seems like that runoff of that big piece for years could have a pretty significant
impact on where the loan portfolio goes?
<A - James Dimon>: You've got to remember. This is an important thing. When it runs off, first of all someone is
losing money. When it runs off, it frees up capital, so we're not losing potential earnings because we can go do
something else with it. It's not like some other types of businesses. So you're right at least with negative revenues, but it
does not necessarily lead to negative profits.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: And again just to reiterate what's happening in our credit card
portfolio, we're shifting the balance and the mix of customers and the nature of that business, so it's a much more
attractive business. We added $41 billion in mortgage origination activity in the quarter, and that was very attractive
business for us.
<A - James Dimon>: And that went to – most of it goes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But we can change that too
and retain more if we thought that made more sense for our shareholders.
<Q - Edward Najarian>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<Q - Paul Miller>: Yes, thank you very much. Mortgage Banking, we've been hearing a lot of anecdotal stuff that the
Mortgage Banking business is really, really strong, with spreads being almost four points on given cash and servicing
relief. Can you add some color? Do you continue to see that going into the second quarter? You saw your production
up 27%.
<A - James Dimon>: The volumes are high, spreads are high, and unfortunately it's all offset by that repurchase cost
because that's a contra-revenue item in that. And I think so far volumes are still good and spreads are still fairly high.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Miller>: And there's a lot of criticism out there that the big banks are not dropping rates as fast as the
ten-year and keeping rates too high relative to keep refinancing. I don't agree with that, but can you add some color to
what you think about that?
<A - James Dimon>: Markets set rates, okay? There are a lot of people who compile mortgages around the world, and
that's usually what determines rates. Sometimes it's how much the system can handle. Sometimes it's people's views of
credit spreads. It's a whole bunch of different stuff. No bank sets the rate.
<Q - Paul Miller>: And we saw Bank of America get rid of their brokerage channel. I guess that's becoming less and
less part of the business. It used to be half of the business years ago for the industry. Do you see yourself doing the
same thing? It's just not that profitable and not that big of a deal anymore?
<A - James Dimon>: I confessed multiple times that one of the biggest professional mistakes I ever made was not to
get rid of that child sooner. We did it a while back. I guess you just weren't paying attention.

Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Doug and Jamie, could you maybe talk about a little bit whether you think the model going
forward on the mortgage side changes as a result of this, whether it's expectations of servicing costs, how the MSR is
valued? Is there something structural that's going to change as you go through these processes and everybody else is
doing the same thing?
<A - James Dimon>: No. Look, the spreads will go up and down. The MSR go up and down. It's still such a critical
product for the American consumer. We don't know how the GSE is going to be redone or the mortgage markets and
we do think a lot of work needs to be done on both. But at the end of the day, servicing mortgages and originating
mortgages for clients will still be a good business with we think a good return.
And the MSR, I think the only material change in the MSR is when we all decide the rates are low and low forever and
never gets any lower, and mortgage rates are low and low forever. MSR is one big IO [Interest Only], and how we
handle that MSR might be a little bit different.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Just following up on that loan growth question, it just would seem that at some point, you
would start to get a higher retention of mortgages at least adjustables and maybe even some of the shorter dated fixed.
Do you see that as something that could happen during 2011?

<A - James Dimon>: Yes. Remember, every portfolio decision is almost a discrete decision. So whether we retain a
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac whole loan, which is conforming, we're buying an adjustable rate security in the securities
portfolio. Those are almost the same kind of decision. So you have seen some of that taking place, but it's in the
securities portfolio, not in the balance sheet or retail.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Got it, great.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: We also just, by the way, we do generate, and it was a very
strong quarter on a relative basis in Asset Management for mortgages in that also we retain much of that. I think it was
1.5 billion this quarter.
<A - James Dimon>: Remember, when you look at the jumbo markets, by the way, the agencies increased their loan
limits. A lot more of the jumbo stuff is going to them.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Right.
<A - James Dimon>: Eventually, that jumbo stuff may be done on the balance sheets of banks.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Right. And then just in terms of the process with respect to Basel, you talked a little bit about
it. Are you going to be reporting your Basel II to the public? And what are we going to see from a regulatory standpoint
during the next couple of quarters?
<A - James Dimon>: Look, we just told you all the Basel numbers. And [inaudible], I think we'll probably be updating
you all on what we think Basel – we're going to pass – remember, Basel II was ten years in the making and was never
done. When we get the final – when we think we might be close to the final rules by the end of November, we'll
probably start telling you roughly, not specifically, what the Basel III numbers would be or when we'll be there and
stuff like that, just so you're aware.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: But again I would go back to the comment that Jamie made
before. We can adjust our balance sheet, but it is not our intent to do things that don't make sense as an economic
matter to improve over the short term what our Basel III numbers might look like because we do have until 2013 for the
initial implementation of Basel III.

usually uses revolvers to grow and extend. Utilization is about the same, but actual loan demand, including unused, is
actually up a little bit.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: About $900 million.
<A - James Dimon>: And actual balances are up a little bit versus last quarter. So that's the first time in I'm going to
say in two years.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Some of it is customer growth, Mike, but we're starting to see
some positive signals out there. And I would add just in that middle market, we're also seeing – we've got a healthy
pipeline of things that we're looking at.
<A - James Dimon>: I hear generally some of the same stuff anecdotally from other banks too.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right. So these are early indicators of accelerating loan growth? It's just that we've heard this
for the past year. Is this the real deal?
<A - James Dimon>: I'd say instead of it going down, it may actually be going up a little bit, but I wouldn't call it
accelerating yet.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. And then as far as Asia, the Investment Banking business in Asia is growing nice double
digits. And Europe is flat, the U.S. is down. What is going on in Asia Investment Banking? And more generally, how
do you think about the build or buy decision when it comes to Asia consumer?
<A - James Dimon>: I think the Investment Banking business is doing really well in Asia, and remember Asia is doing
well, so we grow with the markets and the economy. And we've added bankers and clients, so we're obviously building
up there.
And I think on the consumer side, there will be no build, okay? There will be no build on the consumer side in Asia. It's
too hard to do. We're not going to try. Sometime in the future, and that could be two years, one year, or 20, a buy is I'd
put it as a pretty high likelihood.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And as far as what sort of prices you think you can afford with the cost of capital being lower, with
the current interest rate environment, has it gone up?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, but that's what I'm saying. I wouldn't pick the timetable here. If it doesn't make sense for
shareholders, we're not going to do it. I think we create the most opportunity for JPMorgan really buying – remember,
you don't buy a weak consumer. You basically buy a bank, and it comes with all the attendant businesses with it. I think
the time will be when JPMorgan is doing well, the dollar is doing well, financing costs are low, and maybe Asia is not
doing quite as well. I would say now is not the time.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: We may do something now, but I don't think it will be of the nature you're talking about.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then a clarification, the foreclosure suspension, it's a matter of weeks instead of months. Did I
hear you say that?
<A - James Dimon>: No, it's going to take weeks to clean up the files, but we actually have to have real in-depth
conversations with regulators and AGs and stuff like that, so I don't know exactly when. I'm hopeful that it all starts to
move at one point. I don't know if it's going to be three weeks or five, but I think it will be a real shame if we don't get
this resolved and moving again.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: So in all likelihood, you should be allowed to foreclose as we go into next year?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, I hope so, but it's not up to me.

<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. And then lastly, just a clarification, so you're guiding toward $1 billion of realized
repurchase losses per quarter in 2011...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: That's all of 2011.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: So 250 million a quarter?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And you expect to continue to build reserves above that $250 million a quarter?
<A - James Dimon>: No, no, it's 250 million of expense. It's not clear we're going to need any additional reserve. If we
do, we'll add some. We'll move pretty quickly. But at one point, the 3 billion will be excess, so there's a good chance it
will be $1 billion expense for four quarters to six quarters, and then that expense will be going against the reserve
which we'll no longer need.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: So this quarter is really an exception then as far as your reserving?
<A - James Dimon>: Mike, I hope so, but we can't promise that. It could be the end of it, but there's a chance that
things deteriorate in a way we don't understand.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right, thank you.
<A - James Dimon>: Remember, we also look a lot at underlying assumptions, requests, aging, vintages, loss rates, et
cetera. And if those change, obviously we'll have to change the reserves a little bit.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: On page 17 of the handout, it looks like there's a discrepancy between the upper and the lower
parts of the table, with credit card and subprime early delinquencies continuing to trend down substantially. And that's
what I would expect given the month-to-month numbers that you can get out of Fannie or Freddie or LPS [Lender
Processing Services]. They all show the delinquencies trending down. But we don't see that in the upper part of the
graph, the home equity or the prime mortgage. And I wondered what accounts for that discrepancy and how long do
you think those two patterns diverge.
<A - James Dimon>: We don't know any better than you do, with one comment. Home equity will lag because home
equity, by its nature, we find lags the underlying prime and the underlying real estate and lags more than most other
things. We try to account for that in our reserving, so we actually adjust for it in how we reserve. But on...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: And I'd add at the bottom right, that card delinquency trend,
we're guiding you towards a charge-off rate down 50 basis points for next quarter. So based on what we seen near term,
that's the direction we'd expect that to head.

about the robustness of the MERS [Mortgage Electronic Registration System] system? People have raised issues about
MERS being both principal and agent and the separation of...

Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Hi, good morning; maybe just a quick follow-up on Basel and more the impact from a
competitive standpoint. You alluded to this at the conference, Jamie, but we've done some work, and dug into it. It
really seems to be a big difference between on the market risk calculation between the European banks and the U.S.
banks, and you can see that in the leverage difference. If the incremental returns of the foreign banks, if that persists,
and the incremental returns of the foreign banks on say fixed income trading is much higher, can they undercut you? Is
there a competitive issue here? Or how do you think about the risk weighting calculations and normalized...
<A - James Dimon>: Let me make a couple points. First of all, it has been this way for a long time and it didn't
undercut us.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Right.
<A - James Dimon>: Number two, the regulators have said that they're going to try to make sure that they understand
that these things may not have been equally applied in jurisdictions around the world. And it is incumbent of them to
make sure there is a level playing field because you've noted the same thing that we've all noted. So I'm not going to
worry about it particularly much right now.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Do you think it's doable?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay. And maybe just one question on the repurchase stuff. It has all been lumped in, but can
you give any color on the non-agency stuff? I think that's a big question out there. I think some people have gotten –
we've all gotten I think a little bit more comfortable around the agency side, but the non-agency side is a little tougher
to get our hands around.
<A - James Dimon>: I'm only going to say one thing about it, okay?
<Q - James Mitchell>: Sure.
<A - James Dimon>: In repurchase reserves and litigation, okay, it's unclear exactly how or where it's going to show
up, but we do think there will be some of that. And when we make the statement that some of these costs may go on for
a while, it relates also to that. While we're burning through the vintages and GSEs, there are other vintages that may
have more of a time lag than that.
And I think it's also important to note that they're fundamentally different because a lot of the private label stuff didn't
have the same rules, requirements, disclosures, stuff like that. They're all different.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Right.
<A - James Dimon>: But loan by loan, it's going to have some of the same characteristics that people write, you're
going to have to make them all . Hopefully, they're going to assume just to win, they're making a huge mistake.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Right. Right. But you're already contemplating some of those issues in your current reserving?
<A - James Dimon>: To the extent we can.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Right.

<A - James Dimon>: Reserves are – you can't guess and put up numbers, but to the extent we can. I think the question
is between the reserves we have is how long losses relating to repurchase, whether it's GSE or private label, and
whether it shows up on the litigation or repurchase reserve, how long they go on for. We don't expect it to be a blowup
number. We expect it will be – we'll just drag out these losses as these things play themselves out.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew Burnell>: Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess one
specific question and one general question. In terms of the commercial lending, and you've noted there is some life in
that portfolio in the first time in a couple of years. You also mentioned there has been some improvement in your sales
capacity on the commercial side and the WaMu franchise. I'm just wondering if those two trends are simultaneous, if
you're seeing more demand or more growth out of the former Washington Mutual business opportunities, or are you
still just harvesting what you had in the Chase business?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: I think it's a little bit of both but more the latter, which is I
think we've been putting bankers on the ground and building customer relationships in those states where WaMu did
business. We're using the branch networks there obviously very effectively. And the result of that is, as I said, we
added 500 new customers in the quarter in our middle market business and that's a very positive trend. We expect that
to continue.
<A - James Dimon>: The charge-offs were what in the middle market?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Charge-offs were 89 bps.
<A - James Dimon>: In middle market?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: In middle market, they were 20% of that.
<A - James Dimon>: So middle market charges were very good. Another thing we should point out is deposits in this
Commercial Bank are up dramatically. So we actually think the balance sheet of these companies, they're in very good
shape.
<Q - Matthew Burnell>: So that implies that we shouldn't necessarily assume that there would be deposit decreases
before we start seeing loan increases in commercial?
<A - James Dimon>: I think you might see that, because they may use deposits before they take down loans. I'm just
saying we think they're good. Like corporate America is in good financial shape, we think that middle market
commercial banking America is in good shape too, and they're just waiting for more orders.
<Q - Matthew Burnell>: Okay, and Jamie, just a big picture question. I just wondered if you have any thoughts or
color on the recent FDIC rule-making paper, talking about potentially providing preferential treatment for short-dated
obligations relative to long-dated obligations in a wind down and how that might affect your fixed income business.
<A - James Dimon>: I don't think it's going to affect our fixed income business at all. I think that all this resolution
activity is important that it be done right, and I think you see a lot of to and fro-ing as people figure out what the right
part is. It's going to be some fashion of coordination. It really does need to be done right. The devil is in detail, but it's
not – as of yet I don't see it changing our fixed income business at all.

Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
<Q - Nancy Bush>: Good morning, two questions.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Nancy Bush>: First related to the foreclosure issues and whether there are going to be any extraordinary expenses
associated with that, and is the level of expense and that whole activity now going to be higher going forward?
<A - James Dimon>: Nancy, I think I already mentioned that the way I look at it, we're bearing $5 billion of
charge-offs a year, $1 billion of repurchase reserves a year, a lot of real foreclosures. I don't remember offhand, but big
numbers. Those numbers may bounce up and down and probably will go up a little bit because of this, but I'm not sure
they're going to materially change because of this.
<Q - Nancy Bush>: Okay, thanks.
<A - James Dimon>: And there will be litigation I put to the side. I don't know how it's all going to be sorted out.
<Q - Nancy Bush>: Okay. Secondly, Jamie, this is more a question for you. The head of Boston Fed, Eric Rosengren,
made some comments a couple of days ago about the need for banks to proactively cut their dividends in times of
stress, and that the banking industry had not moved swiftly enough to cut dividends, et cetera, et cetera. It seemed to
indicate an extraordinary amount of hostility towards banks paying dividends. Can you just give us your commentary
on that? You seem to be the only person in the industry who is still confident that you will be able to raise your
dividend in the first quarter of 2011. Could you just give us your thinking on the Fed's attitude right now?
<A - James Dimon>: I didn't say confident. I said hopeful. The people make a good point, okay. The banks going into
this crisis – not all of them, I don't want to paint them all in with the same brush. Some of them kept their dividends
really, really high for a real long period of time when they should have been retaining capital, and with real low capital
ratios. So I think some of those complaints were legitimate, but they're not legitimate for everyone in involved.
The new systemic – the new 7% Basel III incorporates that as you go below the buffer, the first 2.5%, that there will be
restrictions on dividends and comp, and personally I think that's perfectly reasonable. That's where they set the limits
and how they set it. But to me, that's fine. If you go to – the lower your number gets, the less you can raise dividends,
the more you have to cut dividends, the more you have to cut comp, and that's not unreasonable. That's the way a
company should be run. So I think that's probably what he's referring to, but it's built into the regulatory regime as
opposed to not.
<Q - Nancy Bush>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: The other thing about dividends, it's really just there's so much uncertainty. It's clarifying now
around Basel III, capital requirements, systemically important firm requirements, resolution. People are being a little
hesitant on capital. They do want to have more clarity around it. I think why we have more confidence is because we
have so much damn capital.
