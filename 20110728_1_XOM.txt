MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the ExxonMobil Corporation's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call
is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor
Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal
Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. The focus of this call is
ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2011. I will refer to the slides that are available
through the Investor section of our website.
Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on slide two.
Moving to slide three, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. The global
economy and energy markets are being influenced by slower growth and continued uncertainty in the macro
environment. A sustained economic recovery remains elusive as a result of persistent sovereign debt concerns, sluggish
business investments and lower consumer spending. Energy markets continued to see strengthening in crude oil prices
in the second quarter while U.S. natural gas prices showed a modest increase. Downstream industry refining and
marketing margins also improved during the quarter while commodity chemical margins weakened slightly.
Turning now to the second quarter financial results as shown on slide four, ExxonMobil's second quarter 2011 earnings
excluding special items were $10.7 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion from the second quarter of 2010. Our effective
tax rate for the quarter was 45%. Earnings per share for the quarter excluding special items were $2.18, up $0.58 from a
year ago. The corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and

share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share
purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the third quarter of 2011.
CapEx in the second quarter was $10.3 billion, up $3.8 billion from the second quarter of 2010 reflecting the increase
in our U.S. unconventional activities including the recently completed acquisition of the Phillips companies. Across our
diverse portfolio we continue to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for
crude oil, natural gas and finished projects. Our cash generation remains very strong with $14.4 billion in cash flow
from operations and asset sales. At the end of the second quarter, cash and marketable securities totaled $10.3 billion
and debt was $16.5 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash and
marketable securities decreased from $13.2 billion to $10.3 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings,
depreciation expense, higher working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $14.4
billion of cash flow from operations. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E of $7.8 billion
and shareholder distributions of $7.3 billion. Additional financing and investing reduced our cash and marketable
securities by $2.2 billion, including the acquisition of the Phillips companies.
We will now provide a review of segment results starting on slide six. ExxonMobil's second quarter 2011 earnings of
$10.7 billion increased $3.1 billion or 41% from the second quarter of 2010. Upstream earnings increased $3.2 billion
while downstream earnings improved by $136 million. Chemical earnings were essentially flat. Higher corporate and
financing expenses decreased earnings $174 million versus the second quarter of 2010 due mainly to the absence of
favorable tax items. Corporate and financing expenses remained within our continued guidance of $500 million to $700
million per quarter.
As shown on slide seven, ExxonMobil's second quarter 2011 earnings of $10.7 billion were in line with the first quarter
of 2011 mainly due to higher downstream earnings offset by slightly lower chemical and upstream earnings.
Moving next to the second quarter business highlights and beginning on slide 8, we will begin with an update on a
number of our upstream liquids projects. During the quarter we fully funded the Banyu Urip project on the Cepu Block
in Indonesia. The full field development is expected to recover 450 million oil equivalent barrels of reserves and
deliver gross production of 165,000 barrels per day via a 60-mile pipeline to an offshore floating storage and off-take
vessel in the Java Sea.
In Eastern Canada we achieved early oil production from the first well of the Hibernia Southern Extension project.
Project development will continue over the next few years including drilling more wells and providing water injection
capability with full production plateau anticipated in 2014.
We also continue to ramp up activity in Iraq and currently have five drilling rigs operating. Current gross production is
approximately 340,000 barrels per day. We're also progressing front-end engineering and agreements for the common
sea water supply project and lastly, we continue to make strong progress at Kearl where we are currently 68% complete
with construction.
Turning now to our exploration activities on slide 9, beginning in the Black Sea where ExxonMobil holds 6.6 million
net acres, the Deepwater Champion drillship arrived in the second quarter. We are now drilling the Kastamonu
exploration well in the Turkish Black Sea. We expect to have results from this high risk, high potential exploration well
later this year.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico where ExxonMobil holds 2.1 million net acres, we made a significant oil discovery with the
Hadrian-5 exploration well, which commenced drilling in March three days after receiving permit approval from the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
As recently reported, the Hadrian-5 wildcat confirmed the presence of a second oil accumulation in Keathley Canyon
block 919. The well encountered 475 feet of net oil pay and a minor amount of gas. We are drilling ahead to deeper
objectives and have encountered an additional 250 feet of net oil pay to date. Combined with our other Keathley
Canyon blocks, we estimate a recoverable resource of more than 700 million oil equivalent barrels making this one of

the largest discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico in the last decade. More than 85% of the resource is oil.
We're also working with our joint venture partners and other lessees in the area to determine the best way to safely
develop these resources as rapidly as possible.
Turning now to the Phillips acquisition on slide 10, ExxonMobil concluded the acquisition of the Phillips companies on
June 2, 2011. The Phillips transaction included 317,000 net acres across the heart of the rapidly growing Marcellus
Shale play and nearly doubled ExxonMobil's acreage to more than 700,000 net acres in the play. XTO will manage the
Phillips assets from the recently established Appalachian division headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Given the proximity to our current operations in Southwestern Pennsylvania, the addition of the Phillips acreage will
create significant value by leveraging regional synergies and also makes ExxonMobil a leading leaseholder in the
Marcellus. The Phillips properties currently produce 50 million net cubic feet per day of natural gas, which includes
both shallow gas and deeper Marcellus production.
Turning now to our total U.S. unconventional portfolio on slide 11, in the U.S. XTO is currently managing total
resources of 76 trillion cubic feet equivalent, which represents an increase of almost 70% from what was initially
recognized at the time of the merger. As shown in the chart, nearly two-thirds of the resource additions are from
revisions and corporate transfers demonstrating the benefit of the XTO merger. The revisions resulted from by the bit
activities such as down-spacing, additional development and new plays.
Over twelve trillion cubic feet equivalent of resource additions have been added through acquisitions, including the
2010 Ellora Haynesville Bossier and Petrohawk Fayetteville Shale acquisitions, the 2011 acquisition of the Phillips
companies and several other low-cost acquisitions. These resources were added at an average cost of approximately
$0.28 per 1,000 cubic feet equivalent.
Turning now to our global unconventional portfolio on slide 12, ExxonMobil has a diverse portfolio of emerging
unconventional resource opportunities with access to more than 10 million net acres in North and South America,
Europe and Southeast Asia.
Beginning in Argentina, we hold approximately 240,000 net acres in the prospective Neuquén Basin and will begin
drilling in the fourth quarter of 2011. In Canada we are continuing drilling in the Cardium and the Horn River basins.
In Colombia we are preparing to begin core hole drilling in the fourth quarter to evaluate heavy oil potential.
In Poland, we are preparing for well testing, and in Germany we are progressing permit approvals for our well testing
program. In China we are progressing opportunities with the Chinese National Oil Company to apply ExxonMobil's
leading-edge technology to develop unconventional gas resources. Finally, in Indonesia we've commenced coal bed
methane drilling in the quarter and are now on our third well in the Barito Basin. These opportunities represents a large
and growing global portfolio of unconventional assets with the potential for significant value creation through the
application of ExxonMobil's advanced technologies and XTO's strong operational and technical expertise.
Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results starting on slide 13, upstream earnings in the second
quarter were $8.5 billion, up $3.2 billion from the second quarter of 2010. Stronger crude oil and natural gas
realizations increased earnings by $3.6 billion as crude oil realizations increased approximately $36 per barrel and gas
realizations increased $1.42 per KCF. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $480 million due
mainly to the impact of lower entitlement volumes, down time and decline partly offset by the ramp up of Qatar and
Iraq projects and the addition of XTO. Additionally, earnings were negatively impacted by the timing of liftings.
Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $21.35.
Moving to slide 14, oil equivalent volumes increased 10% for the second quarter of last year, mainly due to growth in
our U.S. unconventional resource business and the impact of Qatar and Iraq project ramp up. Volumes were, however,
negatively impacted by lower entitlement volumes, divestments, down time, lower gas demand in Europe and decline.
Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 15, versus the first quarter of 2011 upstream earnings
decreased by $134 million dollars. Stronger realizations improved earnings by $1.2 billion as crude oil realizations
increased over $11 per barrel. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $1.1 billion due mainly to

lower seasonal demand in Europe, higher maintenance and the impact of lower entitlement volumes. Additionally,
earnings were negatively impacted by the timing of liftings. Other items, primarily higher exploration and operating
expenses decreased earnings by $310 million.
Moving to slide 16, oil equivalent volumes decreased 9% from the first quarter of 2011 due mainly to lower seasonal
demand in Europe, down time and the impact of lower entitlement volumes. The facilities that experienced down time
during the second quarter 2011 are now essentially up and running.
Lastly, I'll note that year-to-date oil equivalent volumes increased 10% or over 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day
compared to the first six months of 2010. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, quota effects and divestments,
production was up over 12% and remains consistent with the 2011 volume guidance we communicated at the March
analyst meeting of 3% to 4% growth versus 2010. For further data on regional volumes please refer to the press release
and IR supplement.
Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results starting on slide 17, downstream earnings in the second
quarter were $1.4 billion, up $136 million from the second quarter of 2010. Improved margins increased earnings by
$60 million primarily driven by improved industry refining margins. Continued benefits from our refining optimization
activities contributed $150 million in volume and mix effects while other factors were a negative $70 million.
Moving to slide 18, sequentially, second quarter downstream earnings increased $257 million. Higher industry refining
and marketing margins increased earnings by $350 million while volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $50
million. Other factors were a negative $40 million.
Turning now to the chemical financial and operating results and starting on slide 19, second quarter chemical earnings
were $1.3 billion resulting in a record $2.8 billion dollars of earnings for the first half of 2011. This performance
demonstrates the value of our balanced portfolio of commodity and specialty businesses, integrated world scale
facilities, premium products and technology applications that deliver superior feed stock advantage.
Second quarter earnings were essentially even with the second quarter of 2010. Increased chemical margins contributed
$120 million driven by strong demand. Volume and mix effects lowered earnings by $90 million mainly due to higher
planned maintenance activities. Other effects decreased earnings by $80 million.
Moving to slide 20, sequentially, second quarter chemical earnings decreased $195 million. Lower margins decreased
earnings by $80 million, primarily due to weaker global aromatics margins. Other effects decreased earnings $110
million due mainly to higher turnaround and maintenance costs and some unfavorable tax benefits.
Moving to slide 21, while we manage our Downstream and Chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture
benefits from the unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Looking at our combined downstream and
chemical results, second quarter earnings were $2.7 billion.
Moving to slide 22, ExxonMobil's second quarter financial and operating performance was strong and reflects the
ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong results. As we continue to focus on
operational excellence, deploy high impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil
remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.

<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Doing great. I have a question really just kind of a clarification. In the upstream you
mentioned that the other item which was fairly meaningful this quarter which was $310 million was exploration and
something else. What was that something else, number one? And number two was most of the delta this quarter
exploration?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you're looking sequential at the $310 million? The primary items there were the higher
exploration expense as well as some higher production OpEx associated with the maintenance activities I mentioned.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. And then together they add up to a decent size number, the $150 million in refining
and marketing and chemicals, just generally what were those?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: On the volume, mix effects?
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: The other item, sequential?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sequential. Okay.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Sorry.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, if you're looking sequentially on the downstream earnings of $40 million there's
really nothing significant to highlight. We did have some higher maintenance OpEx that I mentioned. That was the
primary driver there.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Same in chemicals? Is that the way to think about it?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: In chemicals if you're looking at both actually, sequentially and quarter-over-quarter it's
really higher turnaround OpEx primary driver there.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. And also you guys have obviously been very successful in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico and I think you said you haven't even TD'd the exploration well yet. So it may be early but do you have an idea
as to future valuation and approximate timing for that play? And also is there transportation infrastructure in the area?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Well, if you look at what we're doing in the area and again we do have a very nice oil
discovery there, and as we've mentioned publicly we are going to work with our partners and other lessees in the area,
particularly with the Lucius discovery to take that well and include it with their reserves so that we can get that
production on safely and rapidly.
The rest of the block, of course, we have both the Hadrian North discovery, which is a standalone oil discovery that
will not be included in that unit. We're working on what the optimal development scenario of that might be. And we've
also announced that the Hadrian South discovery, which is gas, will also be processed up through the assets in the
Lucius discovery, again, to get that gas to market.
So it's very fortunate that we have the ability to monetize a big portion of those reserves quickly, but at the same point
we're pretty excited. We're still drilling, and we've got a lot of additional evaluation and appraisal to do out there. So it's
a good success story and a nice opportunity to get some production on pretty quickly.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Sounds good, David. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Next we'll move to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Hi, David. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to clarify on Hadrian while we're
talking about that, you mentioned an incremental 250 feet of pay. I wanted to just confirm. Is that over and above what
you had previously reported in the press release? And if so, does that indicate potential upside to the 700 million BOE?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: The answer to that is yes to both of your questions. That's in addition to what we had
announced earlier and certainly provides some upside, and also as you know, is normal in this business, there will also
be some redetermination opportunities as we progress the current development of the Hadrian-5 well. So again, good
news so far, lots more to look at and evaluate and certainly we'll be evaluating the upside and we'll assess the total that
we have once we hit TD.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay, great, thanks. And my second question, David, was on CapEx. If you look at the run
rate for the first half of the year it's an average of about $9 billion a quarter, which would kind of suggest about $36
billion total, which is maybe a couple billion above about what your guidance is. I'm just curious; does the second half
of the year likely fall off a bit? Or are you maybe trending above where guidance was?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Well, I think the first thing to note is if you take out the Phillips acquisition, the CapEx in
the first half is right in line with what we talked about at the March analyst meeting. So ex any acquisition opportunities
that come along, I really don't have any different guidance than what we talked about earlier in the year.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Got it. Thank you very much, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.
Operator
Well take our next question from Mark Gilman of The Benchmark Company.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: David, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Mark. How are you?
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Good Thanks. If you could just help me and clarify in your sources and uses of funds and that
reconciliation, exactly where is the Phillips acquisition showing up? I had thought it was in the additions to PP&E. And
then there's this $2.2 billion item, which I guess even with your comment I still don't quite understand what it
represents. Was there debt associated with Phillips and that's part of that $2.2 billion?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Mark, thanks for the opportunity to clarify that. No. The entire $1.7 billion that we paid for
the Phillips acquisition is in that 2.2 number called additional financing and investment.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: What...
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: That's what that amount is. It's not an addition to PP&E.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Was there debt associated with that acquisition, which I believe was a stock acquisition
not an asset acquisition?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, there was no debt associated with that.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. This is my second one. Now you referred in your comments to liftings and timing effects
on the production numbers. Does that mean or should I assume that your liftings in the second quarter of '11 were
lower than production? Or was that delta versus the year-ago period associated with second quarter 2010?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: That's a good question. Let me clarify that. We were underlifted in the second quarter by
about in absolute terms 69,000 barrels a day, and we were underlifted in the second quarter of last year about 26,000.
So the delta is an additional 43,000 barrel a today underlift. And then sequentially the factor was actually a little bigger.
We were in the delta – we were a little overlifted in the first quarter. So if we look at the delta between first and second
quarter sequentially, we're net under lift position of 87,000.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Try that last line one more time?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you're looking sequentially, we were underlifted in the second quarter 69,000 barrels a
day. We were overlifted a little bit in the first quarter of 18,000 barrels a day. So that net between quarters was 87,000
barrels a day.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Got it. That's 69 underlift. Any particular region?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: The bulk of it was in West Africa and the North Sea.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: So relatively high margin barrels?

Next we'll move to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Ed. How are you?
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Good. Just a question on this CapEx. I mean, obviously you are still responding after the XTO
acquisition and picking up acreage here and there. I mean, should we think of sort of $2 billion here and there as a
reasonable addition to your organic CapEx over the next couple of years?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Ed, I really don't have an answer to that because we don't have a specific target or
objective. It's purely opportunistic, as I've mentioned before. We of course are pursuing resources around the world
including unconventional in the U.S. all the time. And when we find a really good opportunity like the Phillips
acquisition, for example, where we can leverage either some already existing assets that we have or bring some
technology to bear, we will take advantage of that opportunity. But again, it's all about increasing value and particularly
leveraging what we have in the base through the merger with XTO.
As you kind of start to see on that chart that we showed, you're really starting to see how that acquisition has enabled
the growth in that business that otherwise would have been very, very difficult to accomplish. And then in particular
when you look at the low cost of these incremental reserves and acreage you're adding, you start to look across that
portfolio. And then in addition, the opportunities that may come along for the addition of volumes from overseas you
really start to see kind of what might be the value created by this global portfolio of unconventional assets and again,
with XTO as the enabler just a year ago it's pretty remarkable that 12 months after this merger, we've gone from 45 Tcf
under management to 76. So we're pretty pleased with that progress.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Maybe asking it a slightly different way. At 76 Tcf do you think you've got enough? Or do
you think there'll still be opportunities to continue?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Well, we never have enough. I hope we can find some additional opportunities. We're
certainly pursuing those, and again if we come across something that's attractive that we can bring something to the
party to get value that others can't, we will, of course, take advantage of that. And again as we've said from day one,
we're looking for large, high-quality resources with upside potential where we can generate some synergies with the
technology and operating expertise that we have. And again, we're actively pursuing those things but without any
specific target or objective.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And then one final question on the downstream in the U.S. I guess perhaps a smaller uptick Q
on Q than I guess I was looking for given the margin environment and could it just be that Q1 was particularly strong
or it could be that Q2 there was some operational hiccups. Can you talk to any funnies that might be between the

sequential differences?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. As you mentioned we did see some nice margin improvement in the U.S.,
particularly, not only along the Gulf Coast, but as you're well aware of in the Mid-continent area. We did have some
down time and maintenance in the second quarter. In particular we were able to basically get back some of the volumes
we lost in the first quarter from weather in the Gulf Coast, but that was offset by some maintenance activities in our
Midwest refinery in Joliet.

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Dave, we heard from some industry news magazine talking about Papua, New Guinea, your
LNG project may have some hiccup or some delay due to the labor or the construction. So can you give us an update on
what's going on over there? And is that going to be result in any delay of the project start up?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, Paul. Thank you. I'd be happy give an update on that project. Things are going quite
well. As a matter of fact, the project is progressing well. We've got project execution underway including all the
infrastructure development, roads, bridges, site preparation, camps, etcetera. We're scaling up the mobilization of the
contractors as we get into the larger facility build. In fact, we've recently completed some very key milestones and the
project continues as planned. So I mean there's always minor things that come up in any projects, and we manage those.
But as we look forward, the project is on target to deliver first LNG in 2014.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Second question. In the second quarter, can you tell us what is the production reported from
your Iraq project? And also you talked about underlift in the second quarter and overlift in the first quarter. At the end
of June are from the inventory standpoint pretty neutral or you are underlift, overlift? As well as that, in the second
quarter, is there any meaningful asset sales gain or loss?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Okay, Paul. Let me track all three of these. Okay. When we look at the Iraq project, as we
typically don't give individual country volume numbers, I don't have a specific number for you from Iraq. I think the
key issue in Iraq is the progress that we're making there. That's going very well. We've got five rigs running. Got
production and gross up to about 340,000 barrel a day. We're meeting our milestones, and we're working on the
infrastructure necessary to continue to grow volumes.
As you know, the actual production that you might record in any given quarter is really going to be a function of the
price in that quarter as you divide your total revenue by the price to get the barrels. So I don't think that number would
be as meaningful as really letting everybody know that the activity level is up, the production is up, we're meeting our
expectations and things are going pretty well in Iraq.
If we look at the underlift position, I mentioned that in the second quarter we were underlifted on an absolute basis
about 69 kbd and that's kind of where we are at the end of the second quarter.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So you're underlift by about 69 at the end?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And then in terms of asset sales gain, is there any meaningful asset sales gain in the
second quarter given your cash proceeds from asset sales is about in the $1.7 billion and your capital base is pretty low
so I presume that you have some decent asset sales gain?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We have an ongoing asset management program, and we've had some nice sales this year
already. Of course, we had sales in the first quarter that we talked about. And in the second quarter we did sell our gas
led assets in Europe and we did book an asset gain on that. I don't have a specific number for it but that is included.
When you look – if you look quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter where we have the $60 million other effect, that

We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning, Faisel.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Faisel.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: How are you doing?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'm doing fine. Thank you.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: I just wanted to go back to your comments on the resources evolution of XTO.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: I wanted to try to tie that if I can to the production volumes you've seen over the last few
quarters. It seems like overall U.S. gas production volumes are relatively flat over the last few quarters and oil
production is relatively flat, too. So can you talk a little bit about the underlying growth of those assets and where we
are today?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. If you're looking at the – let's talk about the XTO first and looking at that chart. Of
course, the chart I showed is really the evolution of the resource base itself, and so most of that is acreage that we're
just now evaluating, appraising, drilling and that sort of thing. So you don't see a whole lot of production from those
resource adds just yet. If you're looking at overall liquids and gas volumes in the U.S., if you're looking
quarter-on-quarter this year versus last year, you do see about 72,000 barrels a day increase in liquids.
The bulk of that, of course, comes from XTO and then you do see in the U.S. about a 2.4 BCF a day increase in gas, the
bulk of that, of course, coming from XTO. So that gets you year-over-year. When you're looking sequentially first
quarter into the second quarter U.S. liquids are flat and that does reflect some improvement in the XTO volumes offset
by a decline in down time effects. Gas as well in the U.S. about flat quarter-on-quarter sequentially, and that's just
reflecting just kind of the normal decline offset by the work program. And we also had, you might recall a sale of some
Gulf of Mexico assets and that's contributing a little bit to the overall U.S. numbers there. But overall, things are just as
we expected.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: So overall you continue to expect this portfolio to grow production in the U.S. over the
foreseeable future?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. I mean, as we said in the analyst meeting, we do expect that production to grow over
time as we develop and bring some of these resources online but, of course, that takes a little time. And it's overtime
but we're working on it very aggressively.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Last question from me. In your refinery throughput volumes in Asia-Pacific, it looks like from
the fourth quarter into the first quarter those numbers went down for maintenance. And I thought in the second quarter I
thought your numbers would come back up. It looks like volume has ticked down sequentially in Asia-Pacific first
quarter, second quarter. I'm just wondering if you missed some sort of down time or maintenance activity?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: It is. We did have continued maintenance, and it was actually a little higher even
sequentially second quarter versus first quarter. So second quarter was a big maintenance and turnaround quarter for us
in general across the region, but yes, you did see it in the Asia-Pacific area.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Are those facilities back up and running now at 100%?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, 100%. I know that most of that maintenance and down time is up and running and
certainly the turnaround we're getting behind us.

We'll go next to Evan Calio at Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Good morning, David. How are you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Evan. How are you?
<Q - Evan Calio>: Good. Two questions. As you discussed, Exxon is clearly leading the foray into unconventional gas
and oil globally. And my question is on Polish shale. I know we're approaching some important industry well results in
the next few months. You have a second well in 4Q. I guess with XTO's expertise, why not a faster ramp up in Poland
where we have very attractive royalties, a receptive host country at least with the rash of hydro frac'ing concerns and oil
linked commodity prices. Why not a faster ramp there? And maybe you could discuss your recent farm out of 49%
interest of the Podlasie Basin to Total?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Let me step back and give you an overall update on Poland. Actually we are
progressing our activities there fairly rapidly. We had a 3-D seismic acquisition program that we concluded in April of
this year. And we've got – we are currently processing those surveys on one of the concessions and also we have drilled
– we drilled one well that we suspended in February. We drilled another well that we suspended in April and well test
activity on those wells is underway. And we would expect to have those results sometime in the fall. So we are
progressing what we would view as pretty aggressively here and one of the things that, of course, helps that is the
ability to leverage the XTO resources and have them help work on this and both define the appraisal program as well as
understand what we have there as we move forward. Excuse me?
<Q - Evan Calio>: With local services recently one of your competitors locked up Halliburton in a contract. I mean
how do you see availability of services? And how are you proceeding to make sure that you have what you need to
develop that resource?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Well, clearly, getting services is a challenge to the broader industry as we all advance our
plans there. I can tell you without being specific in terms of contracts that we have in place that we don't have any
issues with services and getting the facilities we need. So we're moving right along and again there is no obstacles in
the way of progress and we continue to progress that fairly rapidly.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay. Good. Thank you. My second question on international gas realizations. It's been well
correlated with the lagged Brent, some correlation has been dropping which I guess would be a function of mix in

Qatar volumes. I mean, can you give me any regional delivery destination on contracted LNG volumes generally? And
then I guess it would be interesting to know what percent was moving into Asian markets where slopes are north of 14
today?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Let me hit the latter one and then I'll me back to the former one. There really hasn't
been any change in the delivery destinations of the LNG coming out of Qatar. As we've said before about two-thirds of
it is heading into that Asia Pac area and the other third, which is, of course, spot some of that is going to Europe, some
of it's going into the Asia Pac area. So I think that strategy is working out very well.
We did see when you look at the price realization, a bit of a mix effect in the quarter. We did have some down time on
the LNG trains but that volume was offset by higher flowing gas delivery into the local market. As we've talked about
before, the realizations and the margins in the local market are less than what you see obviously in the delivered LNG.
So we did have a mix effect on the overall realization that you saw in our international gas business.
<Q - Evan Calio>: And then just one last question on a matter of clarification. I think on volumes you said in your
remarks that volumes off line in the quarter that were out for maintenance are back. Were you referencing both
European and Qatar gas volumes?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes. As we look at where we had the maintenance and down time over the quarter and
again a lot of that – of course, a lot of that is your normal scheduled maintenance that you have seasonally in the second
quarter. And so we saw some of that and yes, that maintenance, if you look at it, that maintenance by and large that's
back online. We do still have some stuff we're working on but all of it is either online or coming online and will be up
shortly.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay. Good stuff. Thank you, David?

Our next question comes from Iain Reid at Jefferies.
<Q - Iain S. Reid MBA>: Hi there, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Iain, how are you today?
<Q - Iain S. Reid MBA>: Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Can I ask two questions? On the resource base you're showing
there for XTO that you have managed to obviously improve significantly since the merger, can you say how much of
that is liquids in terms of the way you've determined the resource?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have the exact split with me. I can tell you obviously the bulk of it is going to be
gas. I know there is some liquids content in there but I don't have the breakdown of that resource.
<Q - Iain S. Reid MBA>: Okay. And just thinking more generally about your unconventional gas in the U.S. in
particular I think you've made statements about trying to shift some of your activities towards oil. Could we expect to
see quite a lot of that resource remaining undeveloped at this sort of level of gas prices? Or how do you think about the
kind of short-term economics of developing this enormous resource now in the U.S.?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, let me make a couple of comments on that. Certainly we are optimizing the rigs and
equipment that we have and the human resources that we have available to the highest return opportunities which of
course does include trying to optimize that mix between liquids and gas volumes and we're actively pursuing that as are
others and that's going quite well.
I will tell you in the U.S. where we're looking at our gas wells, all of our gas wells are economically attractive that
we're drilling. We have a pace development of the gas resources. We're fortunate that we have very few leases that we
have to drill to hold. We've got a very high percentage held by production or fee property, so we're really able to

maximize the returns we're getting and optimize where we're locating our drilling activities. So as we look out today
we've got between 65 and 70 rigs running and those rigs are drilling economically attractive rigs even at today's prices.
<Q - Iain S. Reid MBA>: And how many of those rigs are drilling oil prospects – oil unconventional prospects?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let's see. I don't know that I have that detailed breakdown. Clearly when you look at the
size and the relative size of our resource, most of them of course are in gas. I can tell you, just as an example, we've got
seven rigs running in the Bakken. That's up, as you know, from the rigs that were running at the time of the merger so
we continue to progress that. And of course we do have a number of rigs running in the Eagle Ford. If I recall right,
that's probably about two rigs running in the Eagle Ford, for example, and we continue to access those resources as
quickly as possible.
I would say in summary other the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, anywhere we have an opportunity to optimize a rig and
get it on liquids production, we're certainly doing that.
Another area although I don't have the exact rig count we're pursuing tight oil in West Texas and that's just another
example of where we have ramped up that activity here recently. So overall, again, it's take that resource, optimize your
people and your equipment for the highest impact wells, and that could be liquids and it could also be very attractive
gas wells.
<Q - Iain S. Reid MBA>: Thanks, David. Could I just ask one more clarification actually which I missed earlier; what
was the absolute volume number in terms of maintenance in the quarter in the upstream?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. If I look at maintenance – absolute level of maintenance in the upstream for the
quarter we had about an extra 37,000 barrels a day if you look at what we're doing in the second quarter of 2011 versus
the second quarter of '10. And sequentially, this is probably a more important number to you, if I look sequentially first
quarter to second quarter we had right at 100,000 barrel today additional maintenance in the second quarter compared
to the first quarter.
<Q - Iain S. Reid MBA>: Thanks a lot, David. That's great.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Okay. Thank you.

And next we'll move to Doug Leggate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Hi, David. How are you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Doug, how are you today?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Not too bad. Thank you. I'm sorry to labor this maintenance issue. Clearly there seems to be an
issue relating to the kind of margins that came off-line. Could you quantify, please, if possible, the order of magnitude
for the absolute maintenance off-line in the second quarter as opposed to the delta versus prior quarters? And if I may
dig a little bit into Qatar in particular because my understanding is you kind have got $1, $1.50 type domestic prices
versus oil linked prices internationally. So if you can, maybe, quantify how much Qatari volumes were off-line also and
I've got a quick follow-up, please?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Doug, I don't have any specific details on the absolute amounts of the down time. I can tell
you if you're looking sequentially, in Qatar we had about 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day off-line as we did some
work there, but that's the delta. I don't know what the absolute amounts were between the quarters, but we did see
sequentially some maintenance activity there.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Would it be fair to characterize that 27,000 as moving from oil-linked to something in the $1,
$1.50 type level?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Well, I think you could see it as moving from delivered LNG instead going in flowing gas
into the country. I don't want to quote any prices or differentials, but as we talked about before, the flowing oil into the
domestic market sells at a much lower price than our delivered LNG does.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it. My follow up is just a very quick one. I don't know if you mentioned this earlier and if
you did I apologize. I was late getting on the call. Cash flow, what was the working capital impact in the quarter
because it looked a bit light relative to what the run rate should probably have been? I'll leave it there. Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. If you're looking just in the second quarter, we did see a working capital build of
about $2 billion in the quarter.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great stuff. Any thoughts on how the share buybacks evolve beyond the third quarter, given the
current environment?

purchase another $5 billion worth of shares.

<Q - Paul Sankey>: I love results, you know I do. How are you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'm good. Thank you.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: David, we've been, obviously, over a lot of this various stuff but just on European gas volumes,
can you clarify what looks like a 20% down move year-over-year in volumes? I think you were at 3.26 Bcf a day down
to 2.69. And that's probably [indiscernible] (51:18) what you previously said into an answer on this, but what was the
kind of dynamic behind that down move?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If we look at the move down of notionally 600 a day, you're talking about
quarter-on-quarter second quarter?
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Yes.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Actually about a third of that was European demand, just lower demand quarter-on-quarter
and then the bulk, the rest of it, was just normal decline and we also had some additional downtime in the second
quarter.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay. Thank you. I assume, and I can check the data but you can probably just tell me that you're
not bringing any LNG into the U.S. market?

any plans to either re-export LNG or export LNG from the U.S. market, but again, we've got a lot of gas and we're
continually evaluating all the opportunities to bring that gas to market.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: I should clarify, I think what you were saying that two, three years ago you would have thought
exports were totally out of the question whereas now it becomes a bet on whether or not these differentials, these
regional price differentials will hold?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Clearly, for those who are looking at this and when you're going to talk about building
liquefaction capacity in the U.S., you're either making that 25-year or 30-year bet on the continued spread between
European spot prices and U.S. spot prices as they exist today or you're going to find a way to get that gas to the Far
East. So three or four years ago I don't think anybody was talking about it. As we've noted across the industry there are
folks talking about it, but we'll need to see how that progresses over time.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Sure. I think what you've also said more or less is that really you're going to continue pursuing the
XTO business model. I guess with the merger of the best practice of both companies, but essentially the business model
of quite aggressive growth and acquisitions on an ongoing basis, and it seems that you've kept up the pace of XTO
acquisitions since the takeover. Is it fair to say that we should – and I think Ed Westlake was referring to this, consider
that to be the business model going forward? And, therefore, as we've seen in this quarter's results add in an extra slug
of acquisition capital on top of the guidance of I think $33 billion to $37 billion a year of CapEx that you gave us at the
analyst meeting?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Paul, let me answer that kind of in two separate ways. Yes, the XTO model is continuing.
We have been able to acquire both a lot of small acreage positions in terms of getting acreage that's surrounding
acreage that we already have and we don't talk about those but those are all going. And then we have, as I mentioned,
between last year and this year in just 12 months made some really nice opportunistic acquisitions at very attractive
prices to what we have.
So assuming that we can continue to find these things and we're looking at them, I don't have a number for you or
anything to put in a model other than to say as these things come up, and we find them and they have the same
characteristics as what we've been looking at, yeah, I would expect us to take advantage of those opportunities,
particularly again, given the leverage we get from that XTO organization and where it's located and what they already
have and the ability to add these things without adding a lot of overhead and without having to change organizations
and do that sort of thing. These things are very attractive, and we certainly hope we'll continue to have these
opportunities. But I just wouldn't have any guidance in terms of a number because it could be a fairly wide range.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Yes, I understand. On the pipelines, firstly could you update us on the Billings – the near Billing
spill, any news that you would want to share with us on that?
And secondly, are you intending to do anything to address the big spread that we have between these inland crudes
obviously manifested in the Brent WTI spread? What's your view on that? Any potential investments you would make
to address that spread? Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Let me hit the Silvertip Pipeline incident first and I'd like to say right up front that we
deeply regret that incident and we are fully committed to completing the cleanup, learning about what happened there,
how to prevent something like it from happening again and really maintaining our focus on effective cleanup and
remediation of the impacted area and taking care of the folks that were impacted by this incident. Progress is going
very well. We've got about 800 people working out there on that and the cleanup is progressing very well.
When we look at Billings, Billings is still running at reduced rates. We are working on the logistics to be able to supply
feed to that refinery other than what used to come through the pipeline. We have begun some preliminary work on
replacing the pipeline, including discussions on permitting requirements and that sort of thing, lining up equipment and
materials. I can't give you a time as when we might be fully restored there, but we are progressing that at the same time
again as we are progressing the cleanup and the impacts from the initial spill.

If we look more broadly at our supply organization and what's going on today in the Mid-con in particular and folks
talking about as we all know the constraints there that are generating this wide spread. We are as we've talked about
before optimizing to the extent possible, not only the advantage you can get in the Mid-con with the Brent WTI spread,
but also when you look at our refining circuit all the way from Canada all the way down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, we
continue to optimize our own feed plates and really to process a number of advantaged crudes including the Canadian
heavy crudes, shale oil, other heavy crudes, shale oil that's coming out of the U.S.
So a lot of those things are advantaged to a Brent or an LLS crude for example and to an extent we're able to get those
and run them into our refining circuit, we're certainly doing so. So it's not just the WTI Brent, in fact in the Mid-con,
but also the ability to move these other crudes into your refineries, again both in Canada and the Gulf Coast, and we are
actively pursuing that and that's reflected in some of the volume mix impacts that you see.

normal. Could you attribute it to projects or were you spending more on seismic? What was going on there
internationally?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you look internationally at the exploration expense, the driver there for the increase, we
had some dry hole expense in the Philippines and also in Vietnam in the quarter.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. You gave the 1P for your unconventional reserve as $0.28 – or 3P as $0.28. What about
1P for the unconventional for proven?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have a number just for the proven. The way we look at this really is how much
acreage are we getting and what are we paying for it and then as we look at that total resource base that's out there,
what are we getting and how much are we paying for that? And then annually as we always do, and we'll do that in
February we'll do a more robust reserves reporting of the proved as well as the unproved. The real purpose of the chart
today was just kind of to step back at the 1-year post-merger mark and kind of give you folks an update on progress
we've made in just a short year in terms of leveraging what we got at the merger and really showing the advantages that
we're getting now on the resource base.
And I'll also tell you from a transition standpoint, things continue to go very well. Attrition remains low. Management
team is still in place and the organization is working hard on the opportunities they had at the time of the merger and
then all the opportunities that we've added over the last 12 months. So when you think strategically about the
acquisition and the objectives we laid out at the time we talked about the merger, those objectives are being met and
we're very pleased with the progress and very excited about the future.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Two more. You mentioned the attrition rate. What is love percentage-wise?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We're not quoting a percentage. It's equivalent to what it's been prior to the merger the
same rates that people have had before. It's fairly low, but again I think the important thing for us is 13 months after the

merger, it's remaining low and it just hasn't been an issue for us.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. With the Phillips acquisition, are you capitalizing most of that?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes. We'll be capitalizing that acquisition.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Last one for me. As you get more unconventional as you start losing things like West
African output, I think a lot of people have been getting around the question of maybe you're losing higher-margin
barrels, you're going to more cost-intensive type activities on a unit basis. Should we assume that your operating costs
upstream are going to start to increase a little bit?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: When you look across our portfolio and the diversity both from our resource standpoint as
well as a geographic standpoint at any given time, depending on how we're bringing those volumes on stream, you
might see upturns and downturns in both profitability and unit cost. A lot of these things come on in big chunks.
Obviously bringing Qatar on over the last few years had an impact. We talked about the impact Kearl will have and
some of the other major projects. So I wouldn't want to make an overall judgment as to what to expect going forward.
And then quarter-to-quarter, of course you know as we saw this quarter you do see impacts of things like exploration
expense, maintenance expense associated with activity. But going forward, I really wouldn't have any guidance to give
on direction one way or the other.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I probably have time for one more question.
Operator
And will go to Pavel Molchanov at Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Thanks for taking my question. I'll squeeze this one in. Since the last call we've seen yet
another one of your peer companies split into upstream and downstream halves. Of course we've seen others gradually
divesting refineries. Exxon has been kind of absent from that process. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that industry
dynamic.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I really can't speak for some of our competitors and what they're doing with their business
plans. Clearly, when we look at our downstream business and the tremendous value we generate with integration with
the chemicals business and how that whole portfolio is generating the types of earnings and the types of returns that
you've seen them generate over the last couple years, every time we look at this we conclude that our integrated model
combined with our global functional organization just delivers what we've referred to in the past as a sum of the parts
plus kind of valuation.
And so for ExxonMobil, as long as we can continue to maintain that advantage and in fact increase it through
technology advances and some of the investments we're making, I think you'll see over time that model will continue to
work for us. Now if it's broken for others or others don't see the same kind of advantage that we do, it's not surprising
that you might see some different approaches. But I wouldn't classify it as lagging some of the others. I'd really view it
as just continuing to take advantage of the unique situation we have and the competitive advantages we get out of that
and continue to exploit it.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Thanks for the color.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Okay.
David S. Rosenthal
Thank you all very much.
