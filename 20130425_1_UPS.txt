Good morning. My name is Stephen and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been
placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer
period. Please note we'll take only one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call.
Thank you for your cooperation.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations
Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.
Andy Dolny
Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt
Kuehn, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney; International President, Dan Brutto; President of
U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.
Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are
forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the
company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2012
Form 10-K report. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
During the quarter, we reported a $36 million after-tax net gain related to our attempted acquisition of TNT. This is
made up of two components: a $213 million after-tax currency gain from the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary; and a
$177 million after-tax charge for the termination fee and other transaction-related costs. These adjustments resulted in
an after-tax benefit of $0.04 per share. Ignoring the impact of this gain, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter
were $1.04. In our remarks today, we will refer to UPS first quarter 2013 results excluding these one-time items. We
believe this is the most accurate picture of the company's performance.
Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are
included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules, along with the webcast of
today's call, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.
Finally, as a reminder, our goal is to allow as many as possible to participate on today's call. We weren't able to do that
last quarter. So please ask only one question and then get back in the queue. And for those of you who like five-part
questions, don't be surprised when we select which part to answer. Thanks for your cooperation.
Now, let me turn it over to Scott.
D. Scott Davis
Thanks, Andy, and good morning. We enter 2013 in an environment of global uncertainty yet confident in our
strategies and ability to execute.
UPS delivered another quarter of growth, reflecting the management discipline and earnings consistency you have
come to expect. The U.S. Domestic business continues to expand margins: a testament to the ability of our integrated
network and operations technology to serve the fast-growing B2C market profitably.
We continue to raise the bar, differentiating our service in unique ways. Just last week, we deployed a new
enhancement to UPS My Choice, allowing our 3 million subscribers to upgrade to UPS Ground from SurePost,
increasing their visibility and improving time in transit.
Although the International and Supply Chain & Freight segments are facing macro challenges, we are adapting our
strategies to keep UPS on the path to long-term growth. The emerging markets, B2C and industry-specific solutions
like healthcare have enormous potential and UPS continues to invest in them. For example, during the quarter, UPS
became the first global express delivery company to have wholly-owned operations in Vietnam, a dynamic
export-oriented economy. This investment reflects our growing commitment to emerging markets, which will generate
the bulk of global growth in coming decades.
In addition, leverage in the Kiala business to retail model, we launched UPS Access Point locations in the U.K. to
better serve the growing European B2C market. We expect 1,500 locations there by the end of the summer. Continuing

this B2C strategy, in May, we will begin recruiting partner stores in Germany and expect to have more than 2,000 by
the end of the year, and more than 4,000 by the end of 2014. And most recently, we announced the acquisition of the
medical logistics company, Cemelog. We expect the transaction to close in June. It will add about 250,000 square feet
of dedicated healthcare space in Budapest, Hungary and enable UPS to further offer customers expanded access to
regional expertise, reaching new patient populations. This is yet another piece of the comprehensive capabilities we are
building for our healthcare customers across Europe and the world.
While expanding capabilities, UPS also remained dedicated to collaborating with policy leaders around the world to
promote global trade and support our customers' growth initiatives. For example, in the important U.S. to Canada trade
lane, the recently increased customs ceiling for low value shipments will enable faster clearance of goods. Also, talks
were launched on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, an opportunity to increase trade between the U.S.
and EU member states. UPS sees the strengthening of this relationship as a way to improve U.S. and European
economies.
Speaking of economies, although the U.S. economy is poised for growth, it is being restrained somewhat by the tax
increases and sequestration implemented during the first quarter. This will be a drag on 2013 GDP expansion with
current expectations for about 2% growth. However, we expect the small package market to grow faster than the
economy. Around the globe, the eurozone remains sluggish, but UPS volume continues to show steady growth, again
outperforming the economy.
In Asia, uncertainty has increased. After a strong fourth quarter, China's GDP and industrial production growth appear
to have slowed a bit. Regardless of the mixed economic recovery, you can be sure that UPS will remain focused,
execute our strategy and deliver consistent results.
As I wrap up, there are a few items I want to address related to our most important asset, our people. First representing
all UPSers, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Dan Brutto, President of UPS International, who is retiring after 38
years of service. Under Dan's leadership, we have introduced innovative services and technologies to help solve the
needs of our customers. His contributions will have a lasting impact on future generations of UPSers. Dan, we wish you
well in retirement.
The international business will be in good hands with Dan's replacement, Jim Barber. Jim began his UPS career in 1985
and has been a Senior Executive on the international management team since 2004. Most recently, he served as
President of UPS Europe.
Continuing on the topic of dedication and service, in March, UPS demonstrated our commitment to the mission of
supporting those that serve our country. UPS already employs about 25,000 veterans and members of the National
Guard and Reserve. As a result of our participation in the Joining Forces program, there are 25,000 more American
veterans whom we plan to make UPSers over the next five years.
Lastly, I want to provide an update on our labor negotiations. UPS and the Teamsters have made significant progress.
We have resolved the most important issues in the contract and are optimistic that we'll reach a deal very soon. We are
eager to move forward, working in unison with all our employees to deliver unique, innovative products and services
that help our customers prosper and enable UPS to deliver superior and consistent results.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kurt to cover the financials.
Kurt P. Kuehn
Well, thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter exemplifies how the UPS business model delivers
earnings growth in a mixed global economic environment. The U.S. Domestic business continued to perform well,
while the International and Supply Chain segments faced some challenges.
Let's review our results by segment. In the U.S. Domestic, January started out of the gate fast with a post-holiday
season fueling first quarter results. Strong demand for UPS Ground products led to daily package volume growth of

4.4%, increasing operating profit 9% and expanding operating margin by 70 basis points. As expected, we did
experience increases in pension and healthcare costs, although this quarter they were mostly offset by reduced workers'
compensation expense, the result of ongoing improvements in our safety programs. UPS results continue to be lifted by
e-commerce, as omni-channel strategies are playing a bigger role. An increased focus by traditional retailers on using
their brick-and-mortar locations as distribution sites is creating more pickups at retail locations for ultimate residential
delivery.
As we noted last call, B2C growth and differentiated products, like our Returns portfolio, produced surprisingly strong
January volume levels. However, daily package growth for the remainder of the quarter came in pretty much as
forecast.
Revenue in the U.S. segment increased 3.3%, with balanced daily package growth across all products. UPS base rate
pricing remains consistent and in line with our long-term objectives, although that's not fully apparent in our reported
yields. The Ground revenue per piece increase of 1.5% reflects the continuing trend of higher growth in both our
lighter-weight B2C products and our Returns portfolio. Air revenue per piece was impacted by reduced fuel surcharges
and changes in both product and customer mix. But overall, the U.S. Domestic is adapting successfully to the explosive
growth in e-commerce.
Through the use of proprietary technology, systems can now seamlessly merge UPS SurePost packages with other UPS
packages at the point of delivery. This and other enhancements, like UPS My Choice, are helping to expand margins
and at the same time, empowering consumers with tools to better manage their incoming shipments.
Now, let's cover International. Export volume per day grew nearly 4% in the quarter. Asia exports were up about 8%.
European exports increased about 3%, while the U.S. was up just slightly. On a currency neutral basis, export yields,
down 2.5%, continue to be pressured by lighter-weight packages and an increased reliance on non-premium products.
We expected operating profit to be flat year-over-year. However, currency and fuel created a headwind of about $30
million as we ended the quarter $17 million below last year.
As expected, comparisons were negatively affected by the timing of Easter, resulting in fewer local operating days on a
year-over-year basis. In order to address current conditions, we are implementing a number of programs to bring
in-country costs in line with yield growth, generating positive operating leverage.
In the UPS Air network, past changes we've made provided benefits. During the first quarter, our international block
hours were down 2.5%, although our exports grew by 4%. We also responded to customers' needs with air service
enhancements in Panama and Malaysia. And keep in mind, the UPS network efficiency is a long-term trend. In fact,
since 2008, international volume has grown significantly, while block hours have remained flat.
Moving on to the Supply Chain and Freight segment. Frankly, it was a tough quarter. Revenue grew just 1% as
increases in UPS Freight and Distribution were nearly offset by a decline in Forwarding. Profit in the segment was
down $23 million, although we did maintain a respectable operating margin of 6.5%. Keep in mind that last year, we
did have a very strong quarter and benefited from the sale of a surplus facility. As a result of overcapacity, the
Forwarding market remains under pressure especially in the trans-Pacific trade lanes. UPS Asia Air Freight tonnage
and yields were down and we had an overall 9% decline in revenue.
Cost containment and growth in our ocean business could not make up this shortfall. In the Distribution business,
UPS's integrated services, global reach and specialized capabilities supported a revenue increase of about 10%. The
healthcare segment remains a growth engine, although margin expansion was limited by the deployment of technology
and investments in infrastructure, including new healthcare facilities in both North America and Europe.
At UPS Freight, shipment and yield growth combined with productivity improvements helped grow profits and expand
margins. However, profitability in this business unit is still not where we'd like it to be.
Now, let's review our financial strength. UPS generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow this quarter after capital
expenditures of $453 million. In the quarter, we paid $572 million in dividends, an increase of almost 9% per share. In
addition, we repurchased 12.2 million shares for approximately $1 billion. In February, reflecting confidence in our

cash outlook, the Board of Directors reauthorized UPS's share repurchase program for $10 billion. And we are on track
to achieve our target of $4 billion for 2013. We anticipate an average share count of about 952 million shares for the
second quarter.
Lastly, let's discuss guidance. Even though there are some mixed economic signals, we are reaffirming our full year
guidance for earnings per share of $4.80 to $5.06. As you've just heard, first quarter results were a little better than we
had expected due to the strong January in the U.S. Domestic segment. However, we anticipate that, that benefit will be
pretty much offset going forward due to the negative trends in global freight markets.
As a result, in Supply Chain and Freight, we are reducing our full year guidance for revenue and are now expecting low
to mid single-digit growth. We anticipate operating margin of approximately 8%.
To give you some shape on the second quarter, we expect low single-digit earnings per share growth. In the U.S.
Domestic segment, operating margin and profit should be relatively flat due to the continued headwind from pension
expense and the significant benefit last year from the fuel surcharge lag. Keep in mind, as we get beyond the second
quarter, we expect profit growth and margin expansion in the segment. In Supply Chain and Freight, we expect
operating profit will most likely be down on a year-over-year basis. But for International, we anticipate both profit
growth and margin expansion over last year as we see some pull-through from our continued network optimization in
in-country initiatives.
So to wrap it up, UPS will continue to work hard and adapt, demonstrating the power of our business model across a
wide range of economic conditions and changing market dynamics. Therefore, we're maintaining our guidance and
anticipate full year earnings per share to grow 6% to 12% over 2012.
With that, we'd now like to open the call up for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Morning.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning, Brandon.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: I wanted to ask about your domestic profitability and how, even with the change in
UPS My Choice being able to ship SurePost packages to your ground network, how is that increasing efficiency for you
guys? I mean the profitability outlook for the segment?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, great. See, the My Choice is kind of a win/win situation. It's a positive for customers in
that it gives them control, and it's a positive for our operation because it allows us to pre-notify customers that packages
are arriving. Myron, may be you can talk a little bit about how that's helping operations.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Yeah, in a previous call, we talked about how technology has continued to enable us to adapt
and adjust and keep strong margins. One recent win that we spoke about was residential consolidation, where in the
fourth quarter we were able to adjust, and approximately 15% of our SurePost packages were then redirected with a
UPS driver, which certainly enhanced our customer experience and allowed us to continue to reduce costs.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Right. So we'll be continuing to leverage technology to both delight customers and maintain
our economic profitability.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: The real focus there is just increasing density and we're doing a very good job of increasing
density on the B2C.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Go ahead.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Kurt or Scott, maybe you could just touch on the type of trends you're seeing, particularly
on the international package side in April?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, I'd just say, generally, the international package volume flows have picked up in the
fourth quarter last year and really carried through the first quarter, and we'd expect some of the same going forward the
rest of the year. The big change, middle two quarters last year, we had negative trade flows. This year, what we're
seeing, we think, global trade growing faster than global GDP. And we saw both in the fourth quarter and the first
quarter strong growth out of Asia, upper single-digit growth both to the U.S. and to Europe. So those trade flows were
very weak last year; they're better this year. So on the package side, we feel pretty good. The international airfreight
side, while the tonnage is growing slightly, still way too much capacity and yields are weak.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alex K. Johnson>: Good morning. It's Alex Johnson on for Tom.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Hello.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Hey, Alex.
<Q - Alex K. Johnson>: So congratulations on the healthcare acquisition. Just was curious if you can give us an
update maybe pro forma. You talk a lot about healthcare, what is the mix of healthcare in your business? And kind of
what is the growth rate that we should be thinking about?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: We've seen healthcare, in aggregate, grow double digits now really for those last several years
since we targeted this as an initiative. One of the things we like most about healthcare is that it does fully utilize, really,
the entire breadth of the company. On the distribution side, we've got 1 million square feet of healthcare compliance
space. We've developed healthcare compliant forwarding with cold chain capabilities and re-icing at airports and all
kinds of good stuff. And then our world-class small package network with things like Delivery Intercept and proactive
notification, we can maintain high-quality oversight. And even our UPS Freight group has benefited from it. So it's a
very diverse and broad set of products and that's one of the things that keeps us so excited about it, is it allows us to
bring the entire breadth of the company for customers benefit.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: We see really the next 10 years growth similar to the last 10 years. And Cemelog really is just
another piece of the puzzle. It's going to help us in Central and Eastern Europe and we're very excited about it.
<Q - Alex K. Johnson>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Hey, thank you for taking my question. Just a real quick one. Kurt, in your guidance, you had
commented on a bunch of different things, but I thought I heard you say that you expected low single-digit growth in
EPS in Q2. Did I mishear that? And if so, can you correct me what I should have heard?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Right. No, that is – we do think the second quarter will show profit growth, but it will be in the
low to mid-single digits. International, as we said, we expect to see a good strong bounce back; supply chain is still
facing some challenges. And there's a bit of a year-over-year comp issue on the domestic side, where second quarter of
last year on the domestic side we had some benefits, variable comp reductions and some of those things. But in general,
we're still cranking along just fine, we just wanted to give you guys a little bit of the quarter-to-quarter shape.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: We had a fuel benefit last year too in the second quarter, right?

<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Kurt, I have one question, but 12 parts.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Uh-oh! That gives me lots of choices then.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Maybe, Scott, we're hearing a lot of – maybe some of the e-tailers – you're talking about the
growth of e-commerce, and a lot of announcements about same-day deliveries from some of these e-tailers, or potential
of it. Maybe you can address the potential for UPS to participate in that market, or if you've got trials or anything of the
such?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Well, I'll start it off, Ken, and let Alan maybe kick in. But we certainly have experimented with
this with certain customers. I think that's where it is right now, it's an experiment, trying it out. I'm not sure yet that the
economic feasibility is going to be there for this to be a big service ongoing. But, Alan, you may want to dig into that a
little bit.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, I mean I think same-day is really going to be an niche offering that's out there. The
real story is about omni-channel. We've got about 25 or more major retailers that are either using or moving to the UPS
omni-channel solutions. And it's really about leveraging UPS's shipping and visibility technologies: it helps enable a
seamless connectivity between the retailer's website, fulfillment warehouses, the brick-and-mortar stores, and the
consumers and returns. It also – for the retailer, it enables inventory optimization and less markdowns, and for the
consumers, it enables faster click-to-deliver times and greater access to retailer inventory and a broader variety. So
that's really one of the big stories that's driving e-commerce and why customers are coming to UPS.

<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: I'm wondering if you guys are having any issues with the FAA and air traffic control
disruptions because of sequestration. Is that having productivity impact on your U.S. business at all?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, we'll have David respond on that.
<A - David P. Abney>: So far it's had very limited impact. And we have been working with the FAA and working
with the Department of Homeland Security to make sure that continues. We do disagree with furloughing of the air
traffic controllers and we also disagree on certain closing of night operations. We think there are more efficient ways
that they can cut costs that will not impede commerce. And I think that more and more people are agreeing with that as
we go through.

Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: So when you think about the capital budget, kind of looking forward from here, what
types of projects are you guys prioritizing either internally, or from an organic perspective? Like, what should we be
thinking about from a uses of capital outside of the increased buyback, going forward?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, clearly, our top priority for capital deployment is to grow the business. As you know, our
physical capabilities – our aircraft are in great shape and we have limited need for replacement assets, so we're very
focused on growth capital. You saw some examples of that in our announcement with the purchase of the Cemelog, the
healthcare company. So that's our top priority. And we're going to be opportunistic around the world really to build a
platform in emerging markets and other areas.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, I think I'd just add that emerging markets covers an area that we're going to invest in.
You saw us buy our partnership out in Vietnam. We're 100% on to Vietnam in the quarter. There's more opportunities
like that as we go forward. And like the previous question, global B2C gives us lots of opportunity. So we'll see areas
where we can make investments, new acquisitions to help enhance that product.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you can give us some color on
the scenarios that got you to the high versus the low end of guidance, maybe what you are thinking about from a macro
backdrop to get you to one end or the other? For the full year.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, sure, Kelly. Well, certainly, the overall global economic environment will be a huge
driver of it. Domestically, we're not – we're fairly confident that the U.S. economy will be stable, if unexciting.
Internationally, the trade flows have been very, very volatile and so we have to stay attuned to that. So I think the broad
economic environment would be the biggest single driver of the variability, although the other is certainly the attitude
of consumers as B2C becomes a bigger part of our business, then growth in that environment becomes increasingly
important.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, we like – I think the way we talked about that earlier too is international airfreight market;
while the tonnage is growing slightly, we like to see that get more balanced with capacity. Dan, you may talk about it's
a challenging market right now.

<A - Daniel J. Brutto>: Yeah, I mean right now, certainly out of Asia, there's more capacity. So customers are taking
advantage of, obviously, spot rates. I think we still have the best option for our customers in that we can move some of
that freight into our own aircraft to fully utilize, and right now, certainly, our margins are up because we're fully
utilizing our aircraft. We're still running a 13.1% margin in a difficult marketplace and that's primarily internationally
because of the utilization of our own aircraft, and this hybrid model where we can move in our Forwarding business,
when we need space on our aircraft, and move it back when the market expands.

Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much, and congratulations, guys.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: I want to follow up on an earlier question. You are announcing a healthcare acquisition
every other quarter. We talked a little bit about Kiala in the beginning of the quarter; could you help put together the
whole mosaic for us in terms of what you're doing in Europe, what you're doing in healthcare and kind of what the
bigger picture looks like down the road in terms of how this helps drive shareholder value and earnings?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Well, I think, Jeff, we talked about – I think those are two of the big areas that we're going to
continue to expand in. We know the global B2C market's going to grow at a ferocious pace for the next couple of
decades. There's just lots of opportunities. The U.S., I think, is leading the way. And we're – certainly, we're leading the
way with answers to that marketplace with My Choice and other offerings. But Europe, they're starting to – the
percentage of business that's B2C is starting to grow. Asia will grow at a very fast pace.
So we just need to put together the pieces of the puzzle to fill out the customer needs. And we're doing that, we're doing
that in the U.S. We did it with Kiala in Europe. We're taking some of the Kiala applications to other places around the
world, and we'll utilize that. So lots of opportunities. Dan, you got here?
<A - Daniel J. Brutto>: Yeah, I would say on the whole healthcare, we're building out primarily on the backs of our
customers that are forcing us into other areas of the world, and Cemelog is a great example of that. Many of our large
multinational healthcare customers have requested certainly that we get into areas such as Central and Eastern Europe.
We also opened up in Australia. I'm going to be at a ribbon cutting for a building later this month in Hangzhou, China.
So as our healthcare expands out – throughout the world, we will follow where our customers' needs are. Many of those
needs are in emerging markets and certainly we'll set up a platform to serve them around the world in those areas.
<A - David P. Abney>: And you know, with the acquisition of Cemelog, we now have over 6.5 million square feet
dedicated to healthcare and that is spread out throughout the world.
<A - Daniel J. Brutto>: And we're in the early innings, Jeff, on that – in that.

<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Maybe a quick question on B2B. Just want to – just kind of curious how B2B volumes
trended during the quarter maybe; what do you think about the outlook for the rest of the year? Do you see that coming
back at all, as you move out into the second half of 2013?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, B2B volume remains fairly sluggish, and so that's an area that clearly the – we are
hopeful that the industrial base of the U.S. catches fire a little more. We think there are some fundamentals. The other
thing we are seeing though is that the omni-channel that Alan referred to, actually, when it's done well, does drive B2B
volume, because in effect your forward stocking inventory in the stores has to be replenished. It shrinks shipment sizes
and so the state-of-the-art retailers are now actually doing more frequent deliveries to stores to keep inventories
balanced.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: In the segments, we saw the growth in sort of the last couple of quarters for retail and fire, some
healthcare, and manufacturing we think that for B2B primarily it has been weak and still negative, and even though
what – we see a renaissance in manufacturing coming in the U.S. it's not quite there yet.

<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: I wanted to ask: you referenced e-commerce returns in the release, and just wanted to get
a sense of how that business is growing, and really how the economics compare to the original leg of that trip; is it
better or worse? Is there – when you think about the final mile, obviously, the customer is bringing that to you, so I
would think that there might be better economics there, but I'm just kind of curious how you guys think about that and
how the...
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, the – it is certainly an area that we are very focused on. We've invested a lot of money
and technology to create a very comprehensive set of solutions for retailers. Alan, maybe you can talk a little bit about
it?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, as you heard earlier, the vast majority of our growth was driven by e-commerce in
the first quarter. And easy returns are obviously an important part of driving consumers to shop online at a retail
website. And we've got a very robust portfolio that provides maximum efficiency, visibility, and control for the retailer.
And returns are essentially, like you said, a B2B move that's created by B2C. Most of the time, these returns are
dropped off by the consumer at a UPS drop box or at a UPS store, so you have very dense pickups and then you
obviously have very dense deliveries back to the retailers. So – and I would just add that our returns are up about 10%
year-over-year in the first quarter.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: As you know, Justin, dense is good.

<Q - William Greene>: I wanted to follow up on – Scott, some of the comments you made on sort of working with
some of these e-commerce retailers on same-store – or sorry, same-day delivery and whatnot. Some of the questions I
get asked though are whether these same retailers are going to try to build a network that doesn't incorporate the current
parcel carriers in ways that they could actually end up being a competitor. Can you just comment how do you think
about that risk and how do you address it?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Well, we always evaluate risk and we always look to how do we serve our customers the best
way possible. We've certainly evaluated that. I think it's very difficult to replicate the network that UPS has built over
the 105 years we've been around. So while we're not complacent, saying there's not better solutions out there, we'll
continue to invest in the technology and have the best offering out there. And right now, we're working very closely
with all the large customers you're talking about it, providing the solutions. Alan, you work with it every day, any
thoughts?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, I'll just say that maybe even to the earlier question about what we're doing with B2C
and retail and healthcare, we've got a very focused strategy on the industry segments where we're seeing most of the
growth and the opportunity, and certainly retail and healthcare are two of those. So we're very focused on creating
solutions for both brick-and-mortar and e-tail only retailers out there.
On this whole omni-channel, getting back to that, what the retailers really like about the UPS solution, in addition to
the networking of the technology for shipping and visibility at all their stores, is the one driver pickup. UPS can come
in there at the end of day, or really any time during the day or evening, and pick up all their ground, air, and their
SurePost packages and provide, in the local area, next-day delivery for them. So we do think we've got a real advantage
there.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: And I think Alan highlights it there. We think that the real issue will become more next-day
fulfillment rather than same day. Although clearly, we'll help customers do whatever they need.
<Q - William Greene>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Good morning. Can you guys maybe provide a little bit of perspective on the
weakness in the declines in the tonnage market that we see within Freight Forwarding and the weakness out of Asia
that's expected relative to the growth of 8% in the international package segment, specifically the daily export volume
growth? The divergence has been there for several quarters, but I'm just wondering if there is anything specific to what
you guys are doing that's causing that divergence? Are you parcelizing more freight, putting it into the export volume
market? Is there something else going on that would help characterize that discrepancy? Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Brutto>: Yeah, I guess – this is Dan Brutto. First, I would say that there's overcapacity out of the
market, primarily in Asia, because of the belly space that the 777s have allowed, so you've now got upsized newer
planes that have belly space. So at this stage of the game, that would be one issue. That would describe kind of the
price pressure.
The second issue is that the manufacture out of Asia is not what it was. Things are lighter, so there's not as much
freight. Last year, if I look at comps last year, there was a couple of big releases on the technology side that drove up
freight. Those releases did not occur in the first quarter of this year. Going forward, we think that that's probably going
to continue for the short and medium term.
On the other hand, an area that doesn't have overcapacity is ocean, and our ocean business is very robust. In fact, on the
less-than-container load, that business is up over 26%. For the first quarter, we added 300 more destinations as of
February. So we think that that's certainly not going to make up the variance in international air freight, but we think
that that's a good product that we put in the market. So all in all, we think that it's going to be a little rocky road for at

Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nate Brochmann>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Morning.
<Q - Nate Brochmann>: Hey. Actually, just to follow up on that question and I think that's kind of a good
thought-provoking thing a little bit longer term. I mean certainly, like you say, Dan, the manufacturers kind of a little
bit weak and a lot of that is probably tied to consumption near term. But longer term, how do you think about like the
international air freight market in terms of how much of the pressure today is cyclical versus secular in terms of how
far down the curve are we on these lower package weights or the shift from air to ocean or just the change in behavior
as it relates to maybe some U.S. near-shoring? Just kind of wanted to get your bigger picture thoughts on where we
stand with all that?
<A - Daniel J. Brutto>: So, Nate, I would say that the whole idea of innovative products is always going to continue
and those products are going to require air freight to move those around the world. As the world shifts, and we look at
what's manufactured in China, now we see a lot of that manufacturing going down to Vietnam. After Vietnam, it could
be Indonesia; after Indonesia, India. So we're very bullish on the fact that there will be manufacture all around the
world. Global trade will certainly increase, although it's been a little choppy here for the last few quarters. And that will
require air freight. And that's perfectly in our sweet spot.
The other thing that I would say is when the market does contract, as it has, we have our own air fleet. So we can move
freight into our air fleet. When the market picks back up, we'll move that same freight and serve our customers through
the use of flying on other folks' planes. So we're very bullish on the future about air freight continuing to be a big part
of our portfolio.

Our next question will come from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - John L. Barnes>: Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter. A quick question just to follow up on the B2C
discussion. Can you just talk a little bit about the e-commerce customers that you're working with? How much success
are you having in making UPS the sole shipping option for that retailer versus just being thrown up as one of a portfolio
of companies that offer the service to the end customer?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, John, I'll – certainly, it's our goal to differentiate and I think we think we've done a great
job with that being out a year and a half ahead of our competitors with something like My Choice. So that's the ultimate
solution to that. But, Alan, any other thoughts you have on that?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, certainly, something like UPS My Choice is out there to drive consumer preference.
It's extremely relevant to both our retailers and our consumers. And unlike our competitor, most of our residential
packages get delivered by our UPS driver. Scott mentioned, I think, in the opening here that our My Choice consumers
now have the option to initiate a SurePost upgrade to UPS Ground residential service. So now, essentially, all UPS
residential deliveries, whether they're air, ground, or SurePost, are eligible for My Choice delivery options. And that's
really the power of the UPS integrated network.

The other point I'd make is that the offerings like Kiala, which is now being re-branded as UPS Access Point that we
have over there in Europe; that also begins to create that preference. And you'll see UPS Access Point branded on the
retailer's website and consumers able to pick that particular service under the UPS brand. So we're very focused on
establishing both consumer and retailer preference for UPS services in really through value creation.

<Q - Peter Nesvold>: Good morning.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Morning.
<Q - Peter Nesvold>: I was hoping to clarify the guidance. So for the year, the midpoint implies about 9% EPS
growth. If I look at the first year results and take into perspective the second quarter outlook, it seems to suggest that
you have to grow kind of 12% to 14% in the back half of the year to hit the midpoint of the range. Now clearly, the
year-ago comps are easier in the second half. Is it primarily – and would the acceleration growth year-over-year be
primarily on the easier year-ago comps or is there something that sequentially you should see more than a normal
seasonal uplift? Thanks.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: We've been seeing, historically, Q4 get stronger and stronger with us as B2C plays a bigger
role. And so that is part of a seasonal evolution to where we're seeing that happen. We do have an extra working day in
Q3. The International group's got a lot of initiatives that are being rolled into place. Air network, we've done a lot of it
adjusting to and now that we're doing a number of things on the in-country cost. So no, your arithmetic is correct,
absolutely. We're maintaining our full year guidance and we do expect to see stronger and stronger results as the years
go on based on all those factors.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I think particularly, Forwarding, we had a good start to last year on the Forwarding side, and had
a – then had a bad finish. And we expect to have good comparisons on the Forwarding side second half of the year.

<A - D. Scott Davis>: Morning.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So hoping for a little bit more color on some of the mix and trade-down issues going on in
international package. Is there a way you can – we can think about what percent of package now internationally is these
non-premium products and where do you think it goes? And maybe along those lines, what can you do to mitigate the
impact of that or maybe even change the customer behavior?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, I'll let Dan expand a little bit, although you do have to be careful when we talk about
non-premium products, those are defined – against a lot of our competitors, those are still time or day definite, what
would be considered express products. So we do offer a broad portfolio and we've seen customers move up and down.
So I wouldn't put too strong a point on it as a long-term issue. But, Dan?
<A - Daniel J. Brutto>: Yeah, I guess, Kurt, just to expand a little bit, we call a non-premium product our trans-border
product in Europe, which for us is very profitable and growing very well, even in a tough European economy. Our

they're strong, and we're confident that the Worldwide Express products will come back as the world economies
strengthen over the year.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. And I think, Scott, maybe just to put a final point on it. UPS's success has been on
finding cost effective yet profitable ways for us to meet the customers' needs when they do need to trade-down. So
we're not trying to up-sell, we're building an integrated network and if the customer gives us an extra day to get the
product somewhere, we'll take advantage of that either through leveraging other forms of transportation or taking
advantage of that from an economic perspective. So give us a little time to adapt and the integrated UPS network will
continue to generate high returns.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Yeah, that's right. I guess do you think that there is more of that to go, though, in terms of more
shifting to some of the – an extra day kind of business?

Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Good morning, gentlemen. UPS Freight saw a very nice tonnage per day growth in the first
quarter taking market share. Can you talk about what drove those gains and what still needs to be done to get back to
your target LTL margin level?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Great. I'll let Myron talk to that.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Hey, good morning, David. While we did experience continued growth in our freight segment,
we continue to be disappointed in that business unit. We've grown it by offering an integrated solutions for that
customer segment and we've continued to expect slow but steady growth in the freight group.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Clearly, the technology that UPS has integrated has been a real differentiator on the market side
having shipping systems, the visibility systems, pickup confirmation. The ability to have a.m. guaranteed deliveries, all
of those things that we've been so successful within our package environment is differentiating us on the freight side,
although as Myron says, we still got some work to do to get the margins up to our targets.

<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks, good morning. In U.S. Domestic, congratulations on your 70 basis points of

on that? And was weather much of an impact in U.S. Domestic in February or March? Thanks.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Well, given my executive privilege to pick one, I'll let Myron talk about weather.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Fortunately, this is pretty much an all-weather business and we have the ability to adapt to
changing situations and the U.S. operating unit has done a very good job of making those adjustments every year. In
terms of B2B or B2C, as we spoke earlier, the technology that we've deployed has just continued to enable us to adapt
to changing business whether they're heavyweight packages or small B2C retail customers, and continue to expand
margin. So we feel very confident about our abilities moving forward.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, Myron is being humble. This was one of the hardest quarters in recent history for
weather and operations. Just continued storms, just about everywhere, and even April, we're suffering with the floods a
bit. But they've – they managed to execute really well in that environment.

Our next question will come from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks, good morning. Normally, we've thought of Europe as representing about half of
your international business, quite material even with the current standalone network. Would you share your
observations on the evolution of consumer shipping trends in the two markets, U.S. versus EU, at these different stages
of maybe adaption and recovery perhaps also including the B2B/B2C split?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, clearly, we've seen tremendous evolution and innovation in both areas. We do think that
the – Europe is migrating very quickly perhaps a little earlier stage as far as maturity of the market. I know, Dan, you
can you talk to that.
<A - Daniel J. Brutto>: Yeah, I would say Europe is probably three to five years behind the U.S. in the whole B2C.
Depending on what country you're in, I think there are some countries in Europe such as France, U.K. are moving a
little quicker. And I think that's primarily the reason we bought Kiala because technology and turning a B2C into a B2R
is very important for us to be successful. So we're that – we're certainly from an operational standpoint and a customer
standpoint preparing for more B2C growth in Europe. We think there'll be some acceleration and certainly we are
preparing operationally and through our technology to take advantage of that when it comes up.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: To Dan's point, we're over 40% B2C in the U.S. right now and are probably our biggest
countries in Europe are maybe 25% B2C. So that gives you the flavor for where they are at this point in time.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, I was just going to add that our early adoption of having trans-border services
throughout Europe has certainly paid significant dividends over the years, and how we're connecting the countries. And
certainly in the B2C market, with solutions like Kiala and other ones to come, our ability to network those countries so
that shoppers can shop in any country and receive it back in their home country is going to be a real advantage for us
and that's what we're focused on.

in the trans-Pacific. I'm just sort of curious if that's part of the headwinds you're facing and if so, how do you address
that?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, absolutely. Dan?
<A - Daniel J. Brutto>: Yeah. I would say – thanks, Kurt. The profitability in the air freight has obviously been
squeezed. I think a lot of customers, because there's overcapacity in the market, have gone out with spot rates and
outside the contract, just because of the capacity that's in the marketplace. We see that continuing at least for the next
quarter, but think that it will get back to more normalcy at the end of the year.

On the other hand, our ocean profit has been doing very well, not enough to make up the international air freight, but
this premium less-than-container load ocean product, we think, is very successful. We have a supplier management.

load. We have a great road network in the U.S. that we can feed and accelerate the time that the ocean shipment
actually gets into the U.S. market and even the European market.

Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Thanks very much. Hi, everybody, thanks for the time.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Hi, Helane.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: So this is going to be a really easy question for you. Does your guidance for the rest of the
year include any changes in compensation or productivity as a result of the Teamster contract being concluded?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Helane, no, we've really not factored in anything dramatically different. We've kind of trended
this as if the ongoing numbers were similar to previous trends in our basic guidance. And maybe Scott can talk a little
bit on the status of the contract negotiations.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: No, I think we're quite pleased with the progress to date on the contract. We've told our
customers that we want to get this done earlier than usual. Teamsters agree it's important for our customers to get it
done. We've taken on the tough issues, issues like pension, issues like healthcare particularly. We're getting very close
to get this thing done. And we feel good about the outlook, but we'll hopefully have something to announce before you
know it.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question will be a follow-up from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Dan, you had mentioned the capacity issue on belly space. I guess I wanted to get your
guys' perspective on the main deck freighter capacity in the trans-Pacific. With rates being where they are, you'd think
that that capacity would start to come down. We know FedEx took a service down. You guys did some belt-tightening.
Are you starting to see any of the main deck freighter operators in the trans-Pacific respond to that lower rate
environment and if not, how long do you think that will take?
<A - Daniel J. Brutto>: Yeah, I mean as of this point, there are – outside of some Chinese carriers such as Jade that
have got four 747-400s sitting on the fence at Shenzhen. There is a lot of talk. I know Cathay has certainly talked about
it. There's been some large carriers that have talked about it. If the rates continue to be low, obviously, we had that
situation in 2009 where you saw some folks take down some aircraft. It's not at that stage yet. I would say from a UPS
standpoint, we've taken 10% of our capacity year-over-year out of the trans-Pacific lane, and that's also 20% down
from the first quarter in 2011. So I think everyone is adjusting more frequencies today instead of taking whole planes
down.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Due to time constraints, our last question will be a follow-up from the line of Ms. Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie.

<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to see if you could give us a sense,
obviously, with a 70-basis-point improvement in the U.S. Domestic business this quarter, how much more you think
you can improve in that business kind of given the B2C mix, but then some technology and other initiatives you guys
have in the works?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. Well, Kelly, clearly, we set out long-term targets at our Investor Conference of margins
of 14% to 15%. We're making good progress towards that, and we – I'm not going to – there's no specific numbers
other than that I'm going to share with you, although you're seeing great changes, you're seeing innovation driving both
customer satisfaction and improved margins. And we'll keep investing deeply in operations technology. There's a lot
more good stuff to come on that that we'll be sharing with you. So there's still more to come, and I think we feel pretty
good on the business overall.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Thanks very much.

That concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the program back over to Mr. Dolny. Please go ahead, sir.
Andy Dolny
Yeah, I'm going to turn it over to Scott.
D. Scott Davis
Okay. I think we got off to a good start in 2013, but as you probably detected from a lot of our answers, we're still
constructively dissatisfied. We want to do better and we expect to do better as we go forward. But since this is Dan's
last call, I'm going to let Dan Brutto have the last word today. Dan?
Daniel J. Brutto
Well, thanks, Scott. It's been a great 38 years with UPS starting in Chicago in 1975 when we were essentially just a
ground delivery company. And what a journey it's been to now be an international company serving 220 countries and
territories with air products, freight-forwarding products, distribution products, brokerage products. So it's been an
outstanding run. The foundation of UPS is solid. We have a great management team and I'm very confident Jim Barber
and our international team will lead us on to more growth and certainly better opportunities with our great customer
base. Thanks, Scott.
Andy Dolny
All right. Thanks. That's the end of our call and thanks for joining us today.
