Delia H. Thompson
Thanks, Rochelle, and good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings release conference call. With me
this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller;
and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're pleased to have reported another quarter of solid organic sales growth. As we all know, business conditions
around the world are challenging. We, as others, have seen slowing growth in the emerging markets and continued
heightened competitive activity in the developed markets. And the dollar has continued to strengthen in the face of
economic uncertainty worldwide. And any economic recovery in the developed markets is muted and tentative at best.
However, we think our focus strategies still serve us well and are well understood by all our people who are intent on
winning on the ground. Innovation is as important as ever, and you'll hear not only how new products have helped
increase market shares, but about more new products slated for the balance of the year.
While a strong dollar along with higher material prices has resulted in a modest gross margin decline in the quarter, we
continue to believe we will see gross margin expansion over the long term. Our Funding the Growth program is as
robust as ever and is expected to deliver full-year savings at or above our goal. And while our reported advertising is
down as a percent to sales, if you look at the total bucket of commercial spend, it is up both absolutely and as a percent
to sales, as impactful and trial-generating in-store activities have supported our robust new product activity.
Our Global Growth and Efficiency program is proceeding smoothly. As you saw in this morning's press release, we've
expanded the program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities, which we expect will begin to be realized
towards the end of 2015 or early 2016.
And we're seeing some encouraging trends in the markets of China and Brazil. While both these regions declined for
the third quarter as a whole, we saw a reversal toward the end of the quarter, which we believe should bode well going
forward. So as I said, it's a challenging environment, but we think we're well positioned to meet these challenges going
forward.
So turning then to North America, organic sales growth accelerated in North America from the second quarter and
market shares are solid. Our excellent performance in manual toothbrushes was highlighted in the press release. One of
the drivers was the Colgate Optic White toothbrush and built-in Whitening Pen. This new product has generated good
trial and strong repeat rates, ahead of not only our Colgate Optic White manual toothbrush but a competing brush as
well.
In the quarter, another significant launch was Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste and Colgate 360-Degree Enamel
Health toothbrush. While it's early days, results for the toothpaste have been very good. Our national share the end of
September was over 2%, and this result exceeded both historical competitive launches as well as competitive launches
in the third quarter. Importantly, the launch has added incremental share.
Our overall U.S. toothpaste share is now 35.8% for the past four weeks, up a full point versus the year-ago period. This
35.8% share is also ahead of our year-to-date share of 35%. Since the second quarter, consumption growth has been
ahead of category growth. In fact, for the past four weeks, consumption was up 7.6% versus the category growth of
around 2.5%.
A relaunch of our Colgate Total Advance Whitening toothpaste has been accompanied by the launch of Colgate Total
Lasting White mouthwash to take advantage of the power of a complete regimen. Colgate Total Lasting White
mouthwash has an innovative formula that helps remineralize tooth enamel, prevent stains and fight tartar, and has no
burn of alcohol.
Our overall mouthwash share in the U.S. is now at 6.5% year to date, up 120 basis points. To continue this momentum,
we're launching Colgate Kids' mouthwash. This is an opportunity to reinvigorate the kids' mouthwash segment with a
brand mothers trust. Distribution of the product is building at key retailers as we speak.

Of note also is our share in fabric conditioners. The Suavitel brand is, as you know, largely sold in the Hispanic market
and has now reached a record 18% share of the general market year to date, up 130 basis points. Innovation such as
Suavitel Fast Dry has contributed to this success.
Turning then to Europe-South Pacific, this region delivered solid results. Organic sales have increased every quarter
this year and this despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Continuing innovation continues to be an important driver
of our performance. As you know, one of the key elements in our Global Growth and Efficiency program is the
formation of hubs, and much of the hubbing to date has occurred in Europe. As of July, all European hubs have been
implemented, Central Europe West, Central Europe East, Southern Europe, the UK, Nordic, and Western Europe, these
streamlined operations should further position us to effectively win on the ground.
Our Oral Care market shares are strong. In toothpaste, our regional share is at 35.3% year to date, up almost a full point
from the year-ago period, with the most recent reading at 35.4%. The results were broad-based, with increases in
virtually every hub. Our regional manual toothbrush shares are up a full point year to date to 23.5%, with the most
recent reading at 23.8%. Mouthwash is at 17.9% year to date, up from 17.8% in the year-ago period.
Our Sanex business is also performing well across its categories, with share increases in body wash, liquid hand soap,
bar soap, and underarm protection. This year we relaunched our Sanex body wash, which contains the advanced Dermo
Active 3 complex to deliver the three key benefits to keep skin healthy, protection, deep moisturization, and pH
balance. This has helped to strengthen Sanex's credentials in moisturization and elevate the product's quality
perception.
We talked last quarter about the rollout of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer, hereafter
to be referred to as Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection, and that has continued with the launch of the product in
France in September. Italy is scheduled for October and Central Europe East for November to complete the rollout. A
notable performance is in the UK, where the market share is almost 4% in the latest period.
Also in the UK, we entered the electric toothbrush market two years ago. The initial offering, the Colgate ProClinical
C350, was at the higher priced end of the market. So this month we're launching a lower priced version, Colgate
ProClinical C250. Around 75% of the market is priced at this price point, so this launch should make us more
competitive in the marketplace.
Turning then to Latin America, business is strong across the region. And as referenced in the press release, we continue
to maintain strong leadership positions in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. As elsewhere, the regional rollout of
Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection is meeting with success. In Brazil, where it has been in market for about a year, it
has achieved a 2.2% share year to date. In Mexico, where it was more recently launched in April, it's achieved a
year-to-date share of 1%, with the most recent period at almost two points. The product has now been launched in
virtually every country, with only Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and the Caribbean region remaining. Other toothpaste
innovations such as Colgate Total Breath Health and Colgate Luminous White Instant, which we described to you last
quarter, are also being rolled out throughout the region.
Compelling innovation in manual toothbrushes has resulted in record high leading shares in Brazil, Chile, Puerto Rico,
Uruguay, and Paraguay.
In bar soaps, our market share is up 40 point points to almost 30% year to date. Across the region, Protex and
Palmolive hold the number one and two positions respectively. A steady stream of innovation in this category has
helped increase market shares. A recent relaunch is Palmolive Naturals Daily Exfoliation with Oats and Brown Sugar.
Consumers know that it is important to exfoliate the skin. This formula with brown sugar and natural oats provides a
gentle exfoliation for beautiful and smooth skin.
Turning then to Asia, as noted earlier, we've experienced slowing category growth and inventory correction in China,
which has affected overall growth despite a very strong performance in other markets. However, the situation appears
to be improving, as we said it would on our last call.

Despite the external challenges, we have continued with our innovation program. As elsewhere, Colgate Maximum
Cavity Protection toothpaste is meeting with success. Launched in Malaysia in February of this year, it has now
reached almost four full share points in the most recent period and has added incremental share. Our toothpaste share is
now at 73.5% year to date.
In India, where our share is up 30 basis points to 54.6% year to date, our May launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity
Protection toothpaste has already achieved almost 0.5 share point in the most recent period. And across the region, our
manual toothbrush share is up 50 basis points to 30.4% year to date. In India, our key brand, Colgate Super Flexi, has
driven the overall toothbrush share up 210 basis points to 43.7% year to date, with the most recent share at 43.9%,
consolidating our leading position. And in mouthwash, our regional share is up 140 basis points to almost 22% year to
date.
Looking forward, we have more innovation to come. One interesting new product planned for launch in China in the
fourth quarter is Colgate 360 Degree Gold Charcoal toothbrush. As you know, some consumers are very interested in
charcoal as an ingredient, but a new trend which has also emerged with the Chinese consumer is gold. This toothbrush,
in addition to having gold-colored bristles and charcoal-infused bristles, will also have an antibacterial component
within the bristles. And in addition, the product should be very impactful on the shelf with its black and gold
packaging.
Also in the region, we're very excited about our recent acquisition in Myanmar of the Laser toothpaste business.
Together with Colgate's 20% share, the added 35% share of Laser gives us a strong leadership position in this rapidly
evolving country.
Turning then to Africa-Eurasia, business remains healthy in this part of the world, and we were particularly pleased
with the solid volume growth in both Russia and the Ukraine despite all the political turmoil in that part of the world.
Regional toothpaste shares year to date are at 32%, even with the year-ago period. But our most recent reading is at
32.3%, and we see good momentum building behind our continued stream of innovation. Colgate Maximum Cavity
Protection toothpaste, launched in South Africa a year ago, is just now beginning to be rolled out throughout the rest of
the region. And in toothbrushes, we've had excellent results in South Africa, where the share is up three points to
37.7% year to date, with the most recent read at 38.3%.
Similarly, in Turkey, where our year-to-date share is 28.4%, we've seen share momentum in the two most recent
periods, with share reads of 28.9% for May – June and 30.5% for July – August.
Our regional mouthwash share is up 50 basis points to just over 20% year to date, positioning us as the number two
mouthwash brand across Africa-Eurasia. In Russia, we continued to benefit from the launch earlier this year of Colgate
Plax Altai Herb. Our share is up 220 basis points to 27.7% year to date.
Results for the shower gel category are strong, fueled by our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line. Our year-to-date share is at
22%, up 160 basis points, with almost every country contributing to the positive share and momentum.
As elsewhere around the world, innovation will continue. Colgate Total Pro Whitening toothpaste, which provides
12-hour protection for a healthier mouth and whiter teeth, now selling in Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey, will be rolled
out to additional countries in the region in the fourth quarter and next year. Another pan-regional launch starting this
quarter will be Colgate Total Mouthwash, which should help build on our already strong mouthwash business. And in
the Personal Care category, we'll extend our very successful Palmolive Gourmet Spa shower gel line into liquid hand
soaps.
Finally, Hill's; the Hill's business is solid, as new product activity across our brands has delivered good results. Hill's
Ideal Balance is now selling virtually everywhere in the world. Here in the U.S., both the dog and cat wet and dry
products have been well supported by the superstores. In those channels in the quarter, consumption of Hill's Ideal
Balance was up almost 40% versus the year-ago period. The launch is going well in Europe as well and is being
supported by a fully integrated marketing campaign.

Our Hill's Science Diet business in the U.S. is being supported by a Healthier Pets, Happier Lives national campaign,
which is focused on preventative care to drive our new Life Care portfolio of diets. For the year-to-date period, our
consumption is up 15% in our two largest retailers.
In the weight category, both the Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic line and the Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight line
are doing well. And next quarter we will be adding a new variant, Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight for small and toy
breed dogs, the fastest growing pet population. The recent global launch of Hill's Prescription Diet CD Multicare
Urinary Stress Feline, supported by an extensive sampling program and in-clinic feeding trials, is also helping drive
Hill's therapeutic business.
And finally, we're really excited about our latest innovation, Hill's Ideal Balance Crafted, expected to launch next
quarter. Capitalizing on the growing trend of the humanization of pets, this super-premium priced product offers
authentic ingredients prepared the right way with care, and is crafted in smaller batches to help lock in the flavor. The
unique ingredients such as salmon, fresh vegetables, chick peas, buckwheat, trout, and herbs are customized for dogs
and cats. The compelling packaging reinforces the product's attributes.
So in summary, we're pleased that our businesses continue to grow around the world. Our focus strategies are serving
us well. Our new product pipeline is as full as ever, and a broad array of new products launched globally have helped
increase our leadership shares in many markets. We are providing our Colgate leaders worldwide with the tools to keep
winning on the ground. We look forward to sharing our results with you as we move to the end of the year.
And now, Rochelle, we'll turn it over to questions if we could, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: So first just a clarity question. What level of organic sales growth and FX impact is
implied in your 2015 earnings guidance?
And the real question is, Brazil and China clearly weak in the quarter. Obviously, Bina highlighted that trends
improved at the end of the quarter. But we had heard some hope I think last quarter that Q3 trends would improve,
which didn't play out as much. So I just was hoping for a bit of the state of the union on what's causing pressure in
Brazil and China, if those factors linger going forward and how much visibility you have here that your business has
bottomed in those markets. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks, Dara. Let me take a little bit of a step back on the world and our categories and include
China and Brazil in those comments and then take it forward to 2015. Let me start with the developed world, where I
guess we have been saying for a time that our category growth rates are in the 1% to 2% range, with Europe being at
the lower end of that range and the U.S. now creeping up to the higher end of that range, and that hasn't really changed.
When you then turn to the emerging markets, as we have said on the last couple of calls, we came into the year from a
2013 where the growth rates were between 6% and 8% and said that the growth rates were now likely to be between
5% and 7%. And on the last call, we said that those growth rates had decelerated to the lower end of that range. And
what we have seen is that during the third quarter, that has continued to be the case. In other words, those headwinds
have not reversed.
Now very specific to China, on the last call we described and explained how the combination of the deceleration in
consumer consumption led to a destocking of the extended distribution system in China through distributors and

wholesalers and that we thought that would correct itself, in response to a question if I recall, within 60 to 90 days. And
somebody said does that mean the China business will come back from a Colgate volume point of view towards the end
of the third quarter? Now many of us have just come back from an extended trip to Asia, and I'm pleased to say that is
precisely what has happened. In other words, while China for the quarter remains modestly negative, what we saw in
terms of independent off-take data is consumption at about mid-single digits and the destocking working itself through
the system. So as we finish the quarter, our volume was now servicing again that mid-single-digit rate of consumption.
And at this point, we would say we expect that to continue.
Brazil is China redux, except a little bit later. I think frankly, we were planning for a recovery following the World
Cup, and that didn't occur. The category growth rates repeated what we saw in China, and the inventory destocking also
compounded against that reduced consumer consumption level. And again, as Bina has said, we have begun to see that
come back in Brazil with the category growth rates now in the mid-single digits. But it started a little bit later in Brazil,
so it will be a little bit into the fourth quarter before it fully comes back. Pleasingly, in both cases, the consumption,
which is to say what consumers are buying, continues to be at that mid-single-digit level.
So for 2014, we think it prudent to say, with all of that in the mix, that our view on organic top line growth is now
broader. We're saying between 4% and 7% for the year because we think that's prudent. And as we said on the release,
we really have just started our 2015 budgeting process. But based on the information we have today, we think it would
be prudent to likewise say that our organic growth range for 2015 will be in that 4% to 7% range.
Operator
And next we'll move to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Thanks. I guess, Ian, taking that 2015 commentary to EPS, it sounds like, based on where spot
rates are today, I think your 2015 EPS preliminary outlook sounds like it would imply healthy double-digit EPS growth
into 2015. And I guess correct that if it's wrong. And if it's not, can you just talk about why you feel that level of
confidence, especially with some of the macro trends that are going on out there?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: In fact, Chris, thanks for the question. The EPS growth rate for next year, we have tried to be
quite specific in guiding to mid to high single digits in dollar terms, not double digits. And that reflects the recent
foreign exchange deterioration, which as you know was very sharp and towards the end of the third quarter. And when
one goes through the various investor notes that have been written about the business, many people have come to a like
conclusion in terms of what they see dollar EPS growth being.
So as we said in the release, we're expecting another year of growth. And having been asked the question, we would
frame it as 4% to 7% organic. We talk about expansion of the gross margin. And as we go through our budget process,
you would imagine that our target continues to be about 50 to 100 basis point expansion and mid to high single-digit
EPS growth in dollar terms. And that's the way we are framing and approaching 2015.
Operator
And next we'll move to Wendy Nicholson with Citi.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. Could you talk a little bit more about the non-China markets in Asia? Because, if I'm
not mistaken, I think China is only like 20% – 25% of that region. And for the overall organic sales growth to be up
only 1%, it still sounds like there's real weakness in the other markets. I know you called out India as being strong
actually. So what else is dragging down the numbers? Is it the Philippines or Malaysia? What else is big enough to
move the needle there? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: That part of the world is heavily influenced by China and India. And when Bina said India was
strong, India was strong. And the Southeast Asian countries generally performed very, very well during the quarter. So
it really is China and the correction of that Chinese business back to, I stress, this underlying mid-single-digit

consumption rate for consumers.
Operator
And next we'll move to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey, good morning, folks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Again, a couple questions on what's going on in a few markets. Let's pick up where you left
off on the last one on India. India is strong. I guess the question is what's strong in India? When we look at some of the
Nielsen data out of India, it shows volume decelerating throughout the quarter, or at least into July – August, now
reaching almost down 6% for the category for toothpaste specifically. So I guess where is the offset, or is it just
potentially a problem with the data?
And then secondly, we've heard Nestlé, we've heard Unilever talk about some of the pricing problems or challenges
throughout Europe. You've got another quarter reported here of negative price on promotion. So maybe you can
comment a little bit more on what you're seeing in terms of the competitive dynamics and pricing environment
throughout Europe.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Let's take India first. Without getting into specifics, we have seen consistent double-digit growth
in India every quarter this year. We continue to build our market share on toothpaste and on toothbrushes, our
leadership market shares. I would also add, by the way, with that independent study that happens every year in India,
for the fourth straight year Colgate was voted the most trusted brand in any category in India, which gives you a sense
of the consumer loyalty and affection for the brand. One thing we've been doing for a while in India is expanding the
strength of our distribution in the rural areas. And I would venture to say, Jason, that when you start getting to that level
of distribution, without in any way impugning Nielsen or other data sources, the quality of the data becomes perhaps a
little bit suspect.
In Europe, actually we were pleased with Europe. There is no question that pricing has become for some, retailer in
some cases, competitor in other, an approach, a tactic I guess to try and build overall growth. So we were pleased to see
the volume growth we had in Europe and indeed the modest organic growth along with good size margin – gross
margin expansion delivering good financial results there. And as Bina said in her comments, and I think we have taken
this view for some time now in Europe, I think we are clear-eyed about the growth rates that can be expected there.
And we have put an extraordinary focus on reorganizing our European business to make it structurally efficient against
a flat-line growth rate. And I think we're seeing the benefits of that and we're also seeing market shares improve, as
Bina mentioned in her prepared remarks. So this hubbing that we have moved to in Europe is working very well for us
against one of the objectives we had, which was to strengthen our executional capability on the ground.

And next we'll move to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Good morning.

<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Can you just talk about the Colgate Total growth in the quarter and if this triclosan nonsense is
done? And then I have a follow-up.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: The share is flat. You may have seen Javier's note, where they ran an independent survey, I think
with 2,500 people, which basically suggested that the awareness was vanishingly low, in fact, lower than other
ingredients in toothpaste products. And obviously, as you would imagine, we have like tracking data which shows the
same thing, so it is a non-issue. Your follow-on?

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, go on.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Ian, I just wanted to ask you. Is the destocking all done globally now? And do you think the
U.S. is really pulling out because some of the data points seem like the U.S. is really starting to accelerate in the last
month or so?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Let's not get too excited. I think the U.S. is showing modest acceleration, but these things have
tended to be lumpy. But I tried to imply that in my remark on category growth that we are indeed seeing the U.S.
upshift towards the higher end of that 2% range.
On the destocking, given the vastness of the two geographies and the indirect nature of the distribution, China, which
we talked about in the second quarter, we believe on the data we see is done, was done by the end of the third quarter.
Brazil is on the way to being done, and that will be completed during the fourth quarter. There are no other spots of
destocking.

And next we'll move to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, how are you?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Good. I want to get a better sense of why you believe you can go back to double-digit dollar-based
earnings growth long term because you haven't done it in the past five years or so, including this year. And I guess
another way to ask the question is, what do you need to get back to that target? And if your answer is macro and FX,
then how should we all think about your level of defensiveness, indeed the whole industry's level of defensiveness, and
macro insensitivity versus history?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Wow, I haven't finished [Thomas] Piketty's book yet, so I'm not sure how to answer the question.
I think, Ali, the way to think about it perhaps would be on a relative basis. I think for the last several years, we have
seen things happening in our world that have been truly unusual and volatile events, many of them having implications
both in terms of consumer purchasing behavior and fundamentally foreign exchange as people run from risk to
perceived safety, and they impact companies severely in the short term. So while we return to a better macro
environment and a more stable foreign exchange environment, I guess the way to think about it is on a relative basis.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Hi there, thanks. Hey. Going back to China and Brazil, I guess one question on China and
Brazil and then an unrelated question, if you'll entertain it, on Venezuela. First on the volume declines in China and
Brazil, are you able to parse out at all how much of those declines were true unit declines versus negative mix and
trade-down? Because I can see how the unit volumes could reaccelerate substantially and sustainably with inventory
rebalancing, but a trade-down trend or less trade-up anyway might be harder to overcome without macro relief. And
then on Venezuela, it would seem that – I'm sorry.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Go on.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: And then on Venezuela, it would seem that you're now running the risk of operating at a
loss, maybe a material loss in that market with this latest devaluation, although I note in your 10-Q that you've got
some price relief that has come through, which is good. And so I was trying to balance those two things out. Will
Venezuela now be running at a loss? And if so, can you frame for us how far you're willing to go in incurring losses in
that market because it's hard to see how things get better before they get worse, at least from a currency perspective?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: To answer the Venezuela question first, Steve, we're not running at a loss. I think Venezuela is
about 3% of the company's sales and about 1% of the company's operating profit. And as you rightly observed, I think
we mentioned on the last call that we felt we have been in very constructive discussion with the government relative to
pricing. And indeed, we were granted pricing basically across our portfolio in Venezuela, which won't actually move to
the marketplace meaningfully until the fourth quarter and will modestly improve our position there. So indeed, we view
that as a positive. And certainly, we'll not see Venezuela in a loss-making position.
In China and Brazil, we were on a dollar-weighted volume anyway from our reporting point of view. When we look at
the information we have from independent trade surveys, we can track that. Whether you look at volume or value, the
destocking, as I said earlier, in China is now through, and we are back to meeting consumption with our shipments.
And in Brazil it is, in like fashion, working its way through the system and will be completed in the fourth quarter. It
really was the distribution system catching up to the succession of consumer slowdowns, but that consumer
consumption now seems set mid-single digits, and now our shipments are coming back to that.

And we'll move on to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Olivia.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Hi, Ian. Can you talk about what's driving that 50 to 100 basis point gross margin acceleration next
year when presumably FX and raw materials are still a drag at least in the first half and it sounds like incremental
savings don't start kicking in until later in the year? And then maybe this is an opportunity to also give the gross margin
bridge for this quarter. Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I was wondering when somebody would do that. Okay, let's start with the gross profit
roll-forward. So last year it was 59%. In this quarter we pick up a 50 basis point benefit from pricing. Between the
restructuring program and our Funding the Growth savings, we pick up 230 basis points, essentially in line with last
year. Material prices sequentially worsened from the 2.5 point negative in the second quarter to three points, and you've
got 20 basis points of mix, et cetera, and that brings you to the current year at 58.6%, 40 basis points down.
Now if we take that and look forward, the first thing to say, our Funding the Growth program remains strong. Secondly,
our restructuring program remains strong. Third, given the timing of pricing that we took in the third quarter and the
Venezuelan price increases we are now realizing in the fourth quarter, we expect pricing to be a more significant
component of offsetting the material price headwinds.

Looking forward again, we have not finished our budgeting process. But in terms of some of the underlying commodity
costs, one would say that there are emerging signs of weakness. And one would also say that in terms of oil, even
though there is a lead/lag before you get the full benefit of that, we have gone into our budget with a $100 per barrel
assumption, and we know where oil sits today. So it will be a combination of Funding the Growth, where material
prices really end up after we have been through the diligence of our budgeting, and pricing.

And Caroline Levy with CLSA will have our next question.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Good morning, thank you very much. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on Europe.
And there has been some upheaval in the retail environment there. And is there any risk of inventories getting stuck in
the system there? And what are the risks you still see going forward in Europe?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I think the risks are pretty much out there for all to see. I'm not sure retailer-specific will be an
issue. I think I know the retailer to whom you are referring. But we have in those kinds of environments all sorts of
checks and balances in terms of inventory against consumption, and I think it highly unlikely that such a situation
would arise in the European environment.

We'll move on to Connie Maneaty with BMO.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Connie.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: A follow-up of Venezuela. Is the pricing you're getting in the fourth quarter, do you
view it as a one-time event, or do you think the ability to price to offset inflation is coming back? And then because of
the pricing, will the impact of the devaluation in 2015, assuming rates stay the same, be lower than the $0.03 you're
expecting in the fourth quarter?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I will offer nothing on 2015, Connie. We really have not got that far at all. And all I can say about
the pricing we have received is that the government provided specific direction as to the categories that we were
permitted to take pricing in and indeed what the level would be by category and by size within that category. So I think
it would be perhaps naive to assume that that would allow companies to take pricing as they wish. And I think any
future pricing would be likewise a similar discussion with the government. So I don't necessarily view it as a one-time,
but I don't view it as opening the door to companies taking pricing at will.

<Q - Alice B. Longley>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Alice.
<Q - Alice B. Longley>: I have a couple follow-up questions on China. You said that demand is growing mid-single
digits. And I guess you expect your shipments to start growing at that amount, at that rate, starting now. Does that
include online sales? And could you also tell us what percentage of your sales are now online and give us some sense
of how quickly that's shifting? And also, how much of that growth is price?

And then finally, I'm just wondering whether the shift to online could be one of the reasons that there was an inventory
issue. Maybe there was too much inventory in one channel versus this other channel that's growing faster. Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: So to respond, Alice, thanks for the question. Yes, the consumer off-take has returned to that
mid-single-digit level. And yes, our sales are now servicing that level of consumption. So we saw that in the last month
of the quarter, and it would be fair to say that's what we expect going forward.
Relative to online, I know in some categories in China, online is a large and fast-growth segment or retail environment.
But in our business, it's not so. We are represented, but the amount of business done online in our categories is de
minimis and I don't think would have in any way affected the trade destocking. And as we look forward to 2015 in
terms of the balance between pricing and volume for a country, again, we haven't finished our budgeting process and I
probably wouldn't say anyway.

And we'll move on to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Lauren.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the advertising and commercial
investment mix because Bina pointed out in the prepared remarks that the total basket of spending was still up even
though advertising was down. So what is your, I guess, plan for that over the next couple of quarters? Was this
somewhat reactionary to the more competitive environment in the U.S.? But is it really – is that the same around the
world; that there's a bit more in-store promotion going on versus advertising? What were some of the decisions made,
and how – I guess not permanent, but how sticky do you think they'll prove to be?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: If I take a 20,000 view around the world – 20,000-foot view around the world, we have seen in
many markets competitors reduce their advertising weight in market and shift spending to price promotion or
coupon-driven promotion, perhaps in the quest for short-term volume. You have no choice at some level but to respond
to that, so part of it is that. Part of it, as we have said for a long time, and we must find a way of being more articulate
about it, but part of it is structural in terms of the way you engage with consumers. With the techniques we have today,
in-store engagement, the shopper marketing we talk about with consumers, which often comes out of trade spending,
can be a very effective way of building trial for a product, so some of it is a conscious shift to techniques that we know
work when you can target particular consumers in different retail environments.
And as we think forward, our preferred view, as we have said before as well, is that we believe in driving growth,
particularly when markets are growing less fast through innovation and innovation supported by advertising that
generates trial but not price promotion. And therefore, our planning assumption or our thinking going forward is that
we would see that traditional below-the-line advertising come back, but we would not let ourselves become
disadvantaged tactically as time unfolds. But our preferred model is innovation-led advertising supported with quality
execution on the ground that makes your product irresistible in store. By your product, I mean our product.

And we'll move on to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone; Ian, a little bit of a follow-up to Lauren's question with regards to
trade spending and couponing and all that. Do you think that – are you getting, now that you shifted more toward trade
spending, are you getting the volume lift that you hope or not? And if you did, are we going to see more flattish
advertising versus trade spending?

And related to that, also to what extent – what other issues is it that market share gains have slowed either because
Unilever is no longer losing as much share in toothpaste and Procter is more aggressive in some of the key markets like
China and Brazil? Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, where to start. I think it's fair to say that the adjustments we made, and I think we talked at
the beginning of the year about Mexico and the U.S., as Bina has commented, have been effective in rebuilding our
market share, and that was something we believed we had to do in the face of the competitive activity. We don't see
that as a permanent strategy. And I would come back and say innovation-led advertising supported but irresistible in
store is the way we would think about prioritizing our spending.
In terms of the share discussion, you have to go around the world. Suffice to say, you mentioned China. I would say in
China, we have approaching a 34% market share in China, and both our principal multinational competitors are seeing
share decline. And so from an aggression point of view, honestly we aren't seeing it and we're certainly not seeing it in
the market share. So it's a market-by-market thing. And in Mexico and the U.S., it was an adjustment we made. But if
you take the world, our preferred approach is innovation, advertising supported, irresistible in store.

We'll take our final question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Thanks. Hey, good morning, Ian. I wanted to talk about your expectation for 4% to 7%
sales growth for 2015 in the context of lapping China and Brazil destocking and now the commentary about pricing
coming in Venezuela. So it would seem a bit like growth should be better next year relative to this year, so I guess
they're both the same. But how much of that is conservatism? How much of it is an assumption about category growth
somewhere going up, going down? Maybe just any other color you can give on the underlying expectations for next
year would be helpful.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: 4% to 7%, Mark, allows it to get better. But I think just based on everything you see in the world
today, it seemed prudent to widen that range a little because who knows what next year brings. I think when we speak
again after our fourth quarter and we will have been through our budgeting process, we will be in a far better position
to perhaps give sharper guidance at that time.
Ian M. Cook
