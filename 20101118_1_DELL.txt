In Q4, we will be attending the Credit Suisse Technology Conference on November 30, The Barclays Capital
conference on December 9th and the Raymond James conference on December 14 as well as CES in January.
Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are
forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are
discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press release and on
our website. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Please note that on today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP gross
margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP financial
measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation posted on the
Investor Relations portion of our website at dell.com and in our 8-K filed today. I encourage you to review these
documents. Please also note that unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress.
Now I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Rob. I'd like to start by saying that we had a good third quarter with solid revenue and profitability growth and
good cash flow. Highlights for the quarter include an improvement in our gross margins, continued expansion in
emerging markets, and sustained strength in our global commercial customers' demand as they continue to see value in
our products, services, and solutions. These accomplishments validate our strategy and demonstrate we're making
progress towards our long-term value creation framework.
Revenue for the quarter grew 19% year-over-year, driven by our enterprise solutions and services business and a strong
commercial client refresh. We believe we're making strategic progress in improving our consumer business, but we do
still have work to do there. And Steve Felice is here today to provide an update on both consumer and SMB later in the
call.
Execution on pricing and cost initiatives and a favorable component environment led to the highest operating income
we've seen in nearly five years. The profitability in our commercial businesses was driven by improved product
margins in our enterprise solutions and services and client hardware businesses.
Let's take a closer look at the third quarter P&L and key performance metrics which are provided for your reference on
Pages 5 and 6 in the web deck. Revenue in the third quarter was $15.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Enterprise
solutions and services grew 31% to $4.3 billion in revenue. Our client product business grew 18% to $8.5 billion driven
by commercial client hardware revenues growth of 23%. Sequentially, consolidated revenue was down 1%, primarily
due to a softer than anticipated consumer demand environment.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1 billion or 6.7% of revenue. Earnings per share were $0.42, which was up
147% year-over-year, and up 50% sequentially. Interest and Other benefited from the receipt of a $72 million merger
termination fee. For the rest of this call I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating income grew 58% to $1.17 billion or 7.6% of revenue. All of our commercial segments showed improved
operating leverage in the quarter. The commercial segments as a whole delivered 10% operating income, representing a
230 basis points increase from the previous quarter.
We delivered 20% gross margins driven by a better – by better supply chain execution, pricing discipline, and broad
component cost declines which affected all of our lines of business from client hardware to services to software and
peripherals. As these component cost declines work themselves through the industry supply chain, we do expect the
industry pricing environment to more fully reflect these changes.
We continue to manage operating expenses well, while we're making important strategic investments in the company.
OpEx of $1.9 billion or 12.4% of revenue was up slightly, primarily driven by increased expense related to our

performance-based compensation. As we told you in June, our variable compensation plans are directly tied to revenue
growth, operating income growth and cash flow. Interest and other expenses were $20 million with some favorability
from the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets on the balance sheet. Our tax rate was 23.7%. Earnings per
share increased 96% year-over-year to $0.45 per share. We generated $913 million in cash flow from operations and
$866 million in free cash flow.
For the trailing 12 months, cash flow from operations was $3.8 billion. This quarter we purchased a portfolio of
financing receivables from CIT which brings in-house the majority of receivables Dell was managing for CIT as part of
our previously-dissolved joint venture. There are more details on this transaction in the web deck on Page 10.
Our cash convergence cycle was a negative 32 days. While we saw a one-day improvement in days of inventory,
payables fell by five days, driven by our deliberate reduction of inventory levels and the linearity of our supply chain in
the quarter which we think will normalize in the fourth quarter. Days receivable was flat sequentially. We expect our
cash conversion cycle be in the mid negative 30s. We ended the quarter with $14 billion in cash and investments and
issued $1.5 billion in new debt. During the quarter, we repurchased shares worth $200 million.
Now, let's look at our lines of business and regional performance which you can find detailed on pages 11 through 15
of our web deck. We had another strong enterprise solutions quarter which is at the heart of where we're driving this
strategy. Enterprise Solutions and Services now represent 33% of commercial revenue in our third quarter. Servers and
Storage grew 20% and 7%, respectively. In Servers, our new cloud products contributed to our growth while demand
for blades was up 49%. In storage, our EqualLogic business grew 66% and we continue to work with EMC to optimize
this relationship and to drive additional profitable storage growth. In our networking business, revenue was up 36% in
the quarter.
Dell Services revenue grew 55% to $1.9 billion driven by the combination with Perot. The Services business is detailed
on pages 12 and 13 of our web deck. We're now a full year into the integration and ahead of our revenue and cost
synergy targets. We're seeing solid growth in the discretionary project and consulting and attach-based transactional
services. Transactional and project services grew 5% and 14%, respectively. Outsourcing was up 1% year-over-year,
and 3% sequentially. We do have a strong outsourcing sales pipeline, but we continue to experience a longer
outsourcing sales cycle that does appear to be an industry-wide dynamic.
We continue to believe that the corporate refresh cycle is well underway and client hardware revenues overall were up
18% with mobility and desktops up 16% and 21%, respectively. In Commercial, client revenue was up 23% while
consumer growth was weaker at 8%.
Software and Peripherals grew revenues at 8%, driven by strong performance from displays and electronics and
peripherals. Geographically, we saw revenue growth across all regions with APJ up 29% and the Americas and EMEA
up 18% and 15%, respectively. Emerging countries continue to be a key driver. BRIC countries grew at 30% and now
represent 13% of our consolidated revenue for the company.
Turning to our segment level performance on pages 16 through 20 in the web deck, in the three commercial segments
combined, revenue grew 24% to $12.4 billion. Strong demand, pricing execution, and a favorable cost environment led
to strong double-digit gross margin dollar growth in every line of business. The commercial segment delivered $1.2
billion in operating income or 10% of revenue.
First let me start with the Large Enterprise segment. Revenue was up 27% to $4.3 billion led by an ongoing hardware
refresh among our largest corporate accounts. Client revenue was up 38% and server growth was up 16. Operating
income as a percentage of revenue improved nearly 300 basis points sequentially driven by product margin
improvements in servers, storage, services, and client hardware. Operating income was $400 million or 9.2% of
revenue for the large enterprise business.
Our public business revenue was up 20% to $4.4 billion. We continue to see a tougher spending environment in
Europe, offset by overall stable demand in the U.S. Server revenue was up 18% with client hardware up 8. Our state
and local government business in the U.S. represents approximately 9% of the public business, and less than 3% of Dell
revenue. This business was up 5% in the third quarter. Overall, public operating income of $451 million or 10.2% of

revenue was driven by the higher mix of enterprise solutions and services, tight cost controls and the improved
component environment.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Felice to discuss our SMB business and provide some color on the changes that we're
making in our consumer business.
Stephen J. Felice, President, Consumer, Small and Medium Business
Thanks, Brian. As Brian has already mentioned, our commercial business really had a good quarter, fueled by our
transformation to a solutions provider and strong execution in our client business. Our sales teams are executing on
selling the value embedded in our offerings, particularly enterprise services and solutions.
Our small and medium business had a very strong revenue and profit quarter. Our direct model gives us a unique
advantage in the mid-market and we have earned a trusted advisor status with our customers. Revenue of $3.7 billion
was up 24% for the highest level in two years, driven by strong demand across all product lines.
Servers and client hardware were up 28% and 27% respectively. Storage was up 24% and EqualLogic, which continues
to resonate with small and medium business customers, was up 84%. We delivered operating income of $391 million or
10.7% of revenue. High growth and improved profitability occurred in every region of the world. We were particularly
pleased to see EMEA continue a year of share gains and strong profitability.
And while medium businesses led us into the recovery, small businesses are beginning to see signs of strength. Our
recently acquired KACE appliance revenues are exceeding forecast and we're excited about our recent acquisition of
Boomi that will allow us to provide an integration cloud to our customers and new cloud offerings in the near future.
Revenue in our consumer business was $3 billion and we delivered break-even operating income. We continue to make
great progress in matching our supply chain with retail buying seasons. Both our direct and retail businesses were
profitable, offset by investments we chose to make in the business. We've been working all year to position the
consumer business for sustained profitable growth. First, we streamlined our consumer branch to three, Inspiron, XPS,
and Alienware.
In the past few weeks, we announced an exciting new lineup of great products including the Inspiron all-in-one, the
Inspiron Duo, a unique convertible netbook, and three new XPS notebooks with industry-leading sound and video
performance. All of this is enabling our strategy of moving back to a mix of higher price band offerings
Second, our supply chain efforts are progressing well and beginning to deliver some important results. We've cut
delivery times by one week, improved product quality, lowered our manufacturing costs, and enabled ocean shipping
for a significant portion of our volume ahead of the holiday season. We should see positive results from these changes
as we move into the fourth quarter.
Third, we've been maniacally focused on delivering a superior customer experience, a heritage of Dell. Our progress is
excellent with our most recent loyalty scores up significantly to new highs.
Finally, we've shifted our merchandising and advertising to emphasize value with a segmented focus on key consumer
buying groups, all of this will lead to sustained profitable growth.
Now let me turn it back over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Steve. Let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Our year-to-date results are very good, with revenue up
21%, gross margins at 18.3%, OpEx at 12% and our operating income improved to 6.3%. Given the cost challenges of
the first half of the year and the muted demand for the consumer PC business, we feel pretty good about these solid
results and the progress we've made towards improving our operating margins consistent with our long-term value

creation framework. We continue to aggressively expand our enterprise solutions and services capabilities. Commercial
profit margins in this area have improved in each of the last three quarters and this provides strong validation of our
strategy here.
We also continue to see a broad corporate client refresh. This growth, coupled with an improving cost environment
provides an opportunity to continue to deliver strong results, while also making the critical investments to further our
strategic initiatives.
In the fourth quarter, we would normally expect some consumer-driven seasonal growth heading into the holiday
season, somewhat offset by normal U.S. federal business seasonality. While we do expect consumer revenue to be up
sequentially, we expect more muted growth in consumer relative to our previous views. As a result, we expect revenue
overall to track in line to slightly up with what we saw in the third quarter.
As we think about margins moving forward, we believe the improved component pricing will work its way through the
industry supply chain. This effect, coupled with a seasonal mix shift to consumer client, will likely temper our product
margins. We're managing OpEx in a disciplined way and are comfortable with the level of spending we've had for the
business over the last year. For the fourth quarter, we'll continue to make investments in enterprise solutions services
and sales capabilities. We expect interest and other to swing back to approximately a $50 million expense and we
continue to see our tax rate in the 25% to 26% range.
Finally, we expect revenue growth for the full year to track towards the middle of the 14% to 19% growth range we
shared with you in June. As you know, our year-to-date operating income growth is approximately 32%. Given our
strong operating results in the quarter and year-to-date and the continued favorable component environment, we now
expect our total-year operating income growth to be between 28 and 32%. While we don't intend to regularly provide
updates to our annual outlook, we're doing so now given the magnitude of the change in the environment and our
improved operating income performance.
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.
Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Brian. I believe the third quarter results are beginning to demonstrate that the strategy we've described to you
over the past year is the correct one. We have a differentiated strategy around the enterprise that is open, capable and
affordable, and this is resonating very well with our customers. We're pleased with the improvement in operating
margins in our commercial business driven by improving execution and increasing mix of services and data center
solutions.
Over the past few weeks, I've spent a great deal of time with our customers across the U.S., Asia and Europe. More
than ever, CIOs are telling us that investing in IT is a driver of strategic advantage and is necessary to enable
efficiencies and savings longer term. Our data center and solutions portfolio continues to grow as does our own field
and channel partner capability to deliver these around the world. Our customer engagements are evolving from solely
being a supplier of IT hardware to a true provider of IT solutions with a deep understanding of customer verticals. This
change will take time, but we're making progress and we're well on our way.
Fast-growing economies like China, India and Brazil are an area of strength for us and should continue to grow rapidly
for many years to come. While we're pleased with the performance during the third quarter, we see great opportunity
ahead and have multiple engines of profitable growth and remaining improvements in many areas of our business. We
believe we're well positioned to profitably grow in the right areas and navigate the opportunities ahead. It's a great time
for Dell and I see this quarter's results as a strong indicator of what's to come.
With that, we'll open it up for questions.

Thanks, Michael. Just a quick reminder to please limit your questions to one with one follow-up. Casey, can we have
the first question? Casey, can we have the first question?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Nice job on the gross margins this quarter. Just a couple of questions,
Brian, for you as follow up on the guidance. The first is, when you say that you're happy with the OpEx range you've
operate in so far this year, are you referring to OpEx in dollars or OpEx as a percentage of revenue? And then if we do
assume that operating expenses are flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, that implies a high 18% gross margin range.
Is that the sustainable level going forward? Or do you think it will take a couple of quarters for the component costs to
work their way into industry pricing?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Katy, thanks. On the OpEx, it's really
a range around the percentage of revenue that we would talk about. So I think your math really does make some sense.
I would say that, you know, as we look at component pricing, we saw what we'd call a more normalized commodity
deflation environment in the quarter.
As we think about how that trend is going forward, we'll continue to see a similar environment, I think, as we head into
the fourth quarter. We will begin to see, I believe, that deflation work its way through the supply chain and affect
pricing over the next couple of quarters. I think that's the way we think about it. As we look at – you know, I think the
way I think about it, Katy, is the year-to-date performance with revenue up 21% and gross margins around 18.3 for the
first three quarters of the year is a relatively good sort of framework. And I think as we move towards the long-term
value creation commitments with 7% operating income, it's good progress towards that.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: And just to be clear to follow up on the OpEx. Typically in the fourth quarter, OpEx does rise
sort of low to mid-single digits sequentially. Would you expect a similar uptick? Or do you think you can hold OpEx
relatively flat with revenues?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Again, I mean, we're managing
it to within a range based on a percentage of revenue. So we kind of like where it is right now.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay, got it. Thanks so much.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. Brian, you alluded to the improvement in gross and mainly – and operating
margins by default as coming from three sources, supply chain, pricing and component cost declines. I was hoping that
you could maybe – given that some of them are quite interrelated, I was hoping you could define what you mean by
each of those? And if you had to dimension the 280 basis point improvement in gross margin sequentially, how much
might be attributable to each of the factors? And I have a follow up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks, Toni. I guess wouldn't get in
to that because they really are very interrelated as you think about that. And, you know, as we talked about coming out
of the second quarter earnings call, we did say that we expected gross margin improvement and there were some good
external dynamics. Component deflation was about what we expected, maybe a little better in the quarter and we saw
some of that coming out of the second quarter. Again, we think that will continue for at least the next quarter.

And as we think about supply chain and all of the things we're doing on cost, I think that's just – we saw the benefit of
that kind of come through in the quarter. And at the same time, we were also working pricing and pricing discipline as
we exited the second quarter. And had the favorable carryover impact of that and got the benefit of that. I would also
say, Toni, there's the mix and strong performance we see on the enterprise side of the business is a big part of the
strategy, you know, is also a good positive dynamic that's affecting it.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: Okay. Well, just to follow up. I mean it looks as though your guidance is implying a fairly
material sequential deceleration in gross margins, call it 150 basis points plus or minus, assuming OpEx is going to be
relatively flat. I think you said that you thought consumer margins, operating margins would be 2% in Q4 so that would
be positive. Do you, A, still stand by that? And in light of the fact that consumer looks like it's going to get better on the
operating side and hopefully that means also on the growth side, what is accounting for what appears to be a fairly
significant deceleration in Q4? Do you – is it really all the pricing kind of rolling through in the industry? Or is there
something else there? It strikes me as being more than one might anticipate.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Toni, I think consumer will
continue to make progress. You know maybe Steve can talk a little bit about where we see that going. But clearly the
mix of consumer in general in the fourth quarter will be a bit higher as we see the sort of typical seasonality, even
though it's a little weaker demand. It will be a bigger piece of our revenue and, therefore, margin. And I think as we
look at the component environment, we expect it to continue to be pretty good. There will be some areas where I think
it will bottom out a little bit and maybe LCDs and hard disks as we see those markets play out. And then the third thing,
obviously, as this pricing sort of works its way through, Toni, we would expect to see a little bit more challenging sort
of competitive environment.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: Yeah, I'm struggling because the mix shift is maybe minus 20 basis points sequentially. And
it sounds like you feel pretty good on components. So you're basically saying the pricing playing through may
negatively impact things 100 or 150 basis points sequentially. And I'm wondering if you have high conviction in that
number? Or you might be conservative? Or it's still not entirely intuitive to me.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, look, I think those are the
dynamics that between mix and pricing playing out and the overall consumer piece, I think those are the main elements
that are going to drive gross margins as we look into the fourth quarter.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. Thanks. Just to follow-up on Toni's question. I was hoping that you might be able to
give us a little more color on the competitive environment. And specifically, are you seeing less competitive pressure
out there right now given the strong demand been in the marketplace? Is there something on the competitive pricing
front that makes you comfortable that margins will hold and you'll be able to keep a little bit of this component
favorability for a little longer than you typically might? And then I've got a follow-up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Richard, we'll have Steve talk to that
one.
<A - Stephen J. Felice, President, Consumer, Small and Medium Business>: Yeah, I'll be happy to talk about that
one. The first point I think is important is that we are moving to a more value-based pricing methodology. And so you
saw some of that this quarter. And while the competition is always tough out there, I think we're doing a better job of
segmenting the business, the types of offerings, the customer sets we're going after. And we think that that will
continue to help us as we've talked about in the past in improving margins over the long term.

On the consumer business, we're certainly seeing competitive juices flowing in different parts of the world, emerging
countries. China has seen some increased pressure. But again we're doing a pretty good job of being selective in how
we're growing. Our China business was profitable. So I think the competition continues to be strong, but we're doing a
better job of picking our fights and knowing where to grow.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Can you talk a little bit about pricing, specifically for large enterprise and public as well?
<A - Stephen J. Felice, President, Consumer, Small and Medium Business>: Yeah I can speak to that in general.
That's not the area that I manage. But the dynamics there are very similar to what we're seeing in other parts of the
world. A lot of our public business is mid-market. And so those dynamics are similar to the mid-market in SMB. And
there's a good case again where the growth is pretty healthy. And so if we're selective about where we choose to sell
and the solutions we have, we've been able to hold up the margins pretty well. And the pricing has not been as big of a
battle as it has in the past.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I also think we're seeing a pretty
material shift in the way we're conversing with our customers. So we used to kind of start the conversation around the
box. And we're moving the conversation much more to solutions. And, so, as we get deeper vertical expertise and
understanding about customer requirements, that's giving us a much healthier opportunity to drive up the margin stack.
And you're seeing that certainly in the commercial businesses and we're, we continue to add more and more horizontal
and vertical solutions into the mix.
<A - Stephen J. Felice, President, Consumer, Small and Medium Business>: And, Rich, I would just say for -- both
for LE and Pub and really across the business I mean we saw strong pricing really in the quarter. And I think you have
to think about it with the cost pressure we saw in the first half of the year, we started working that early in the year and
continued to drive it through the summer.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. Well, thank you. And then the follow-up was on Large Enterprise which was actually
strong year-over-year but down sequentially. And I'm just curious if you consider that to be – actually both Public and
Large Enterprise were down sequentially. I know you talked about European government, but I'm curious whether you
view those two results as normal seasonal. It seems like they're not. And whether you would characterize that as a
cooling in the corporate upgrade cycle or – I guess what's the right way to think about the results in those two areas
sequentially? Thank you.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think one of the trends you see across business is a
pruning of the portfolio where we're taking out revenue that has no margin or very little margin associated with it. And
you see that across many aspects of our different products and geographic segments. So what you saw is that those
businesses improved their profitability in absolute dollars and margin percent sequentially while the revenue might
have come down.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: There is some flattening too of
seasonality as our Asia businesses and our European businesses grow faster because they typically don't have big
upticks in Q3 and they're becoming a bigger portion of our business.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay, all right. Thank you.

We will take our next question from Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
<Q - Brian Alexander>: Thanks. Just on the sustainability of the performance this quarter, which was obviously
strong and better than everybody expected, if I just take the midpoint of your new operating income guidance for the
year and compare it to your old guidance, the delta is basically the upside you just reported in the third quarter. So it
basically implies no flow through or upside to Q4 relative to where most models were. So if the component cost
environment's more favorable than you expected, if pricing may get more competitive but it could take a few quarters

so that's not really a big impact right now, you're making strides in the supply chain cost structure, Perot is tracking
ahead of plan, those are all good things, why wouldn't your Op-income guidance be going up by more than the Q3
upside we just saw?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think the dynamic is that as we
expect this component pricing dynamic is going to continue as more normalized. We would expect that to bottom out in
a couple of places. And as we talked about I think we're a bit concerned in terms of how that's going to play out in the
supply chain and what pricing does for the quarter. We also do see weaker demand in consumer than we expected
coming into the quarter.
So those are the dynamics that I think dampen – dampen the fourth quarter a bit. But, again, as you said, there are some
pretty good external dynamics to drive business in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Brian Alexander>: Can I clarify, Brian, on the outlook for Q4, I know you said consumer will be more muted.
Are you saying then that the non-consumer business will be up with normal seasonality in Q4?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. That's generally our view. I
mean, we see sort of normal seasonality around the commercial business for the fourth quarter. Yeah.
<Q - Brian Alexander>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, thanks, Brian.

We'll take our next question from Maynard Um with UBS.
<Q - Maynard Um>: Thanks. So you pre-bought inventory heading in to the last quarter. One, I guess, are you
pre-buying here? And then obviously you've worked down that inventory sometime intra-quarter. And I'm curious this
next quarter, you should be getting a full quarter of component pricing benefits. So if you look at that decline in the
gross margin, it actually implies a bigger drop, maybe, in pricing from competitors. And typically the industry doesn't
cut pricing unless there's some elastic benefit to units and revenue. So I'm just curious if there's just some layer of
conservatism there or if there are some other dynamics that are in play there?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I would say on the inventory
levels, Maynard, we – we took the inventory out early in the quarter as we saw pricing come down. So the majority of
the benefits in the declines we saw in component costs, most of that fell through within the quarter. We got most of the
benefit within the third quarter. Again, we're – we're trying to read forward in terms of how the supply chain and how
the competitive dynamics will play out around pricing and there's some degree of uncertainty there. That's what we'll
watch through the fourth quarter.
<Q - Maynard Um>: Okay, and then can you just clarify whether there – what kind of currency benefits or what kind
of currency you're assuming in the outlook for next quarter as well? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Currency for us in the quarter was
relatively minor on the top line as well as in the income statement. We are – as you know, our hedging approach is
designed to mitigate short term volatility and as we head into the fourth quarter we've got sort of our typical coverage
and we would expect it to be a minimal impact in the fourth quarter as well.
<Q - Maynard Um>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Steve Fox>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions. First of all, you've highlighted Perot in a couple of spots
but can you talk a little bit more color around how successful Perot has been for you? Especially you mentioned
pull-through of additional services. But what about on the hardware side, how it's helping so far and what are the
opportunities going forward over the next year?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'd say we're seeing some nice
opportunities across, you know, both of the businesses as we – as we bring them together. The integration has gone
well. And we're able to provide customers now with a much broader suite of offerings that's yielding new – yielding
new opportunities that neither organization were able to – to go access. We still have a big, you know, organic build out
in front of us around the world in services. So, you know, we have roughly 1% share in IT services, so there's a lot of
white space for us to go cover there. But very pleased with the integration at year end, particularly in the verticals
where we've – where we – you know, where Perot had strength. We're seeing tremendous success, for example, in
healthcare. And we can grow this a lot more.
<Q - Steve Fox>: Great. And then just secondly on the enterprise cycle, you're talking about normal seasonality for the
January quarter. But the last two or three quarters have continued to show more and more momentum in enterprise
spending. Are you suggesting it's slowing down to a more normalized rate? Or is this like you said just seasonal and we
can expect – we could be looking at more attractive growth rates next year?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think with what's going on in the
global economy, one would take a bit of caution looking into next year. What we see in our business is that the refresh
cycle is very much in full bloom. And you look at Windows 7. You look at Exchange 2010 on the server side. You see
enormous adoption there. You look at Office 2010. We continue to see a healthy refresh cycle. And the things that
we're selling our customers yield very high ROI. And we're able to sell a broader range of them at increasing margins.
So we're feeling pretty good about the commercial business.
<Q - Steve Fox>: Great, thank you very much.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: I just want to go back to gross margins if I could. Brian, on your slide on the consumer, you said
there was $120 million one-time revenue gain in the quarter. I was wondering what that was, and does that mean that
it's a baseline that we should be judging our – our gross margins is actually – is it actually 80 basis points lower. So
19.2 should be the baseline for how we go sequentially with your outlook? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, what we're talking about is – it
was a one-time, $120 million increase. It was tied to the, you know, a change in accounting from a sell through to a
sell-in model. As you accumulate data in a relationship, you know, like this, the accounting basically says you move –
ultimately to a sell-in model once you have enough information to do that. So that was a one-timer. And that would
affect the baseline. And as we think about the fourth quarter, you know, the consumer business, you know, that's one of
the things they'll have to kind of manage through.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Okay. And then, with regard to Perot, you know, the – the services line, you know, I don't know
was – seemed like a little below expectations and I was just wondering if Perot is – if your services revenues are
meeting your expectations and what did Perot specifically do in the quarter?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You know, as I think we've said, it's
become very, very difficult for us to continue to parse out the Perot standalone business. Much of that has been
integrated and transactions are moving through different systems now to the point where it's hard to tell.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's no longer a standalone business; I think that's a
fair way to say it.

elements that we talked about in terms of transactional versus outsourcing versus project consulting, and with the
numbers we talked about there, generally, especially on the synergy side, that's probably the best place to look at it. We
continue to track above our commitments around synergy there for the deal. So...

We'll take our next question from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. Brian, I wanted to see if I could go back to OpEx for a second. I understand
your comments around the upcoming January quarter, but if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about
it for the balance of calendar year '11. Is it a percent of revenues such as revenues grow you'll keep pace with it? And if
growth moderates a little bit because, as Michael said, the global economy, there's some risk there, you know, how
should we be thinking about that OpEx line and the variability of it as we think about calendar year '11?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, Keith, I think as we've said, as
you move towards our long-term value creation model and really where we're going, longer term, we would expect
gross margins are going to trend up as a function of the mix of our business moving. And at the same time, OpEx will
move up as we have more investment in R&D and higher end, more costly selling costs within that kind of a business
model. So, you know, we'll obviously give you a little bit more clarity as we get to the end of the fourth quarter and
provide an outlook for FY '11. But, you know, I think we will continue to make investments around R&D, around
solutions selling and those that we've noted as important to our strategy.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay, but then Brian, if I could follow up on cash flow. I think you mentioned that cash flow –
you anticipate tweaking down the cash cycle. If you could just talk a little bit about, you know, how you're thinking
about cash flow over the next couple of quarters, specifically.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think the good news is the cash P&L
is very strong and that was the key driver of the cash in the quarter despite, pressure in working capital and accounts
payable. We think that the DPL will move back, you know, a few days in the positive direction for us as linearity
improves and as the inventory changes and isn't as dramatic in the quarter and as we get back to sequential revenue
growth. And we should see strong continued mid-negative 30 kind of cash conversion cycle and therefore cash flow
should be significantly better than net income as we move forward over the next several quarters.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Aaron Rakers>: Yeah, two questions or one and one follow-up. First, on the demand front, I think you guys talk
in your presentation about server shipment growth of 4% year-over-year, what looks to be against a pretty easy comp a
year ago. I'm curious, IDC actually estimated about 16%, 17% growth in server shipments for the calendar third

quarter. Could you help us bridge the gap there? Did October slow down? Why the differential in your overall growth
relative to the market?
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Server revenues were up 19% year-over-year. We
don't particularly think units are a great way to measure the server business particularly with virtualization. We're more
focused on the profit and the revenue with servers, not the units.
<Q - Aaron Rakers>: Okay. The follow-up then would be can you characterize the demand environment in the month
of October relative to what you saw September?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It was pretty good. I think there are
certainly unit-driven deals that come and go that we may choose to take or not take. In the quarter, there were certainly
some low-margin, high-unit deals that we chose not to take. I mentioned earlier the kind of pruning of the business and
it occurred across many parts of Dell and I think you see it in the rising operating and gross margins in the business.
<Q - Aaron Rakers>: Thanks.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Thank you. Good afternoon. The question revolves around the storage business, kind of two
parts here. One it just seems that the growth on a relative basis did decelerate. Can you talk a little bit about that, what
some of the puts and takes were? And then more broadly speaking in terms of the recent M&A activity in storage.
Michael, can you weigh in what your view is post 3PAR. We've also seen Isilon go away here. What's kind of Dell's
strategy here going forward to keep pace with some of the other technology players?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You know, if you look at our storage
business, we had EqualLogic growing 66%. It's now over an $800 million run rate. We continue to invest in that
business. You have seen how we have purchased Exanet to add CIFS and NFS file system capability, Ocarina to add
de-duplication and compression capability. We're going to continue to build out that portfolio. We have a 10-year
relationship with EMC. That relationship continues to evolve and believe that we'll continue to be working with them
as well.
So, you know, when we look at the growth in the gross margins in our storage business, we're quite pleased with the –
the gross margin in this business has roughly doubled over the course of the last two years. So we're very focused on
continuing to grow our storage business. And for us the measures of success are profitability and we're pretty pleased
with the progress we're making.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Just wanted to get a sense in terms of the follow up here as far as the operating margin
associated with some of these enterprise solutions. Can you give us a sense of your U.S. versus non-U.S. exposure?
How should we think about as you roll out and deploy and get your greater scale say in Quarter 2, Quarter 3, Quarter 4
after you deployed to some of these bigger enterprise solutions accounts. Will the operating margin run rate kind of be
the same, U.S. versus on-U.S.?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Operating margin is not dramatically
different by geography. Actually quite close with the U.S. being right about the average. And it takes us a few quarters
to kind of roll these things out around the world. So they have different rates in terms of how fast we can localize the
products and that kind of thing. But we're seeing strong adoption. For example, in China, we've had great success with
EqualLogic. And, Steve, you might want to talk about that.
<A - Stephen J. Felice, President, Consumer, Small and Medium Business>: Yeah. EqualLogic more than doubled
in China. And the margins were very similar to what we're seeing in the U.S. And storage growth and server growth in
Europe came at margins very similar. So I really see a very tight range of margin performance on our enterprise
business globally.

We'll take our next question from Brian Marshall with Gleacher & Company.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thank you. I'd like to follow up on the storage side. It looks like you grew about 7%
year-over-year. And relative to some of the larger competitors, it seems a little bit light. I was wondering if you're
doing well on your branded business, are you potentially de-emphasizing some of your partner programs?
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, there's no question that the portfolio of the
business is shifting somewhat. You know, as we mentioned, the profitability of the business is increasing in a
significant way. And, again, we're managing our business to grow our operating profits and dollars, operating margin
and gross margin percentages are going up. And there will be shifts inside the revenue mix as we index into more
profitable solutions.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Okay. And if you look at your net cash balance, it looks to be about the fifth largest in the
entire tech space. And I was wondering with regards to your appetite for M&A going forward, if you're not disinclined
to pay some of these 10x LTM revenue multiples going forward for some of these hot properties? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. I mean, as we've said, we're
going to have a bit of a discipline and we'll be patient in that approach to thinking about M&A. But we're also going to
make organic investments in the business. And as we've done over the last several quarters, we'll continue with a
relatively modest buy-back program as well. Pretty disciplined with that approach right now.

We'll take our next question from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Great. Thank you. A question on the client refresh, Michael. I think you said it was in full
bloom, I guess. How early are we in a refresh? It feels like it's mostly still in front of us. If you could expand on that?
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. All of the data that we see would suggest that
there's still a very large install base of non-Windows 7 PCs that are going to be replaced by Windows 7 PCs. And the
preferred path is a hardware-driven upgrade for most customers. We also see a huge wave of virtualization, Office 2010
and probably that we haven't talked about as much but the Exchange 2010 upgrade we believe is very, very strong. And
we're right in the middle of all that with our customers.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: So as a follow up, how does the virtual desktop discussion and tablets in the corporate world
play into a client refresh? Does it slow things down at all?
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well virtual desktop is an option for many
customers and we're working hard to make that a more viable option. We have a full next generation client architecture
solution set to go drive that. I would say the virtual client is still in a very nascent stage of adoption. And not seeing
widespread adoption yet of that. But we'd be happy to and we have good solutions for it.
As far as the tablet goes we think that there's obviously a lot of interest and excitement around tablets. And we're
working on a number of new tablet products that we will be coming out with next year to kind of cover all of the
opportunity we see in both the Commercial and Consumer segments for tablets.

We'll take our next question from Abhey Lamba with ISI Group.
<Q - Abhey Lamba>: Thank you, Michael, you mentioned about pruning your product portfolio. Can you elaborate on
that? How far along are you? And how much margin upside can it offer? Also what type of revenue growth impact
should we expect from that?
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Not sure I can quantify that for you except to say
that we're very focused on continuing to have a higher mix of our own intellectual property and driving higher value
solutions. We have more to do here. But we've made some nice progress. And our guide is going to be improving our
overall profitability. I think there's more opportunity here as we look ahead into next year.
<Q - Abhey Lamba>: Got you. Thanks. And secondly, based on your historical experience, what type of impact do
you think Intel's Sandy Bridge chip launch will have on pricing? Is that kind of baked into your expectation and pricing
drop as people might look at flushing the inventory in the channel?
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well because we're 80% kind of Commercial and
20% Consumer, we probably first think about it from a Commercial standpoint. And what I would tell you is I think
that for those customers that have not kicked off a refresh cycle, the Sandy Bridge is a great entry point. And we're
already having those discussions now. We're seeing a lot of customers planning as that kind of being the entry point. I
think it does – it will excite the consumer base as well with the integrated graphics performance and some of the new
capabilities there. So we see very nice things in terms of the product cycle.

We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Yeah, thanks. Just going back to the Public vertical, you talked about expectations I think
seeing a normal seasonal down tick in Jan. Could you maybe talk more specifically what you expect to see in Public
spending in Europe versus the U.S. in the Jan quarter?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it's – as we said it is a bit of a
tougher environment for us in EMEA in Public. In terms of the scale of our business, we have a much bigger Public
business than the U.S. and in North America. So despite the fact that it's a bit of a challenging environment in EMEA,
the overall impact on our public business won't be that big. And we would be obviously much more heavy weighted
toward the U.S. public sector.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Got it. And then I just want to go back to the gross margin question that everyone had. I mean
if you look at the 280 basis point margin expansion, how much of that do you think is from kind of sustainable drivers
like better pricing or supply chain savings versus more unsustainable drivers that will go away like commodity
deflation flowing through the industry over time?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it's a hard question to really
parse the individual elements of that. And I would just say the benefits and the positive momentum we have on gross
margins is really the – it's a function of multiple things, including a good component cost environment and good
execution around costs and solid momentum in pricing. And if you think about that as the key elements that drive it,
those are things that we're focused on. And if the environment continues to be good from a component cost standpoint,
it should be a relatively good environment for us to sustain good momentum here.

We'll now take our final question from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Hi, thanks very much. To follow-up on that last question, is there a point where you changed
strategies and turned more aggressive from a market share standpoint given your gross margin performance just
reported?
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We're focused on profit share, not market share.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Okay. Second question, I wanted to come back to the tablets space and the overall
smartphone space. Given the management changes there, what should we expect from a strategy standpoint? Should we
expect a meaningful strategy change going forward? And can you give us any color in terms of operating systems
strategy for that mobility space? Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me address a bit of the operating system piece
and then I'll turn it over to Steve. We are very much in the mobile space working with both Android and Windows
Mobile 7 and encouraged with the development of both of those and see those as great opportunities for us.
So, Steve, why don't you...?
<A - Stephen J. Felice, President, Consumer, Small and Medium Business>: Yeah. From a marketplace standpoint,
we see a lot of potential here and the changes that we announced are really driven to bring this capability into the
mainstream of the business. So you can think of it as the last year of us learning and doing it in an isolated fashion but
now being more bullish about the opportunity.
So we want to mainstream the supply chain, the sales capability, the marketing capability. And we see tablets having
great potential not just in our consumer business, but in our commercial business, so all of this is aimed at getting this
more to scale in a faster fashion than we originally envisioned.
