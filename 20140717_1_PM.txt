MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Phillip Morris International Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call
is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask
questions at the conclusion of the investment community.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications.
Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli
Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our
2014 second quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we
will be talking about results for the second quarter 2014 and comparing them to the same period of 2013, unless
otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI or currency, asset
impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as
reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.
Please note that Reduced-Risk Products, or RRPs, is the term we use for products that have the potential to reduce
individual risk and population harm.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the
forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the
various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.

It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
As we expected, we achieved strong results in the second quarter, driven by a lower cigarette volume decline of 2.7%
and a solid pricing variance of $494 million. As result, net revenues, excluding currency, increased by 4.5%, and
adjusted OCI was up by 9.5% on the same basis. Both the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions had a very
strong quarter, with adjusted OCI growing by 28.8% and 27.1% respectively excluding currency. Furthermore, the EU
region achieved a 3.3% increase in adjusted OCI excluding currency, despite the adverse pricing impact in Italy. The
result in the Asia region meanwhile continues to be impacted by challenges in specific markets, although we are
making progress in dealing with them.
Our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by 20% to $1.56 per share. This was driven by our strong business
result and a relatively easy comparison with the same quarter last year.
For the first half of the year, our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, increased by 12.4% to $2.91. However, we
will face much more challenging comparisons during the second half of the year, and in particular, during the fourth
quarter. In the second half, we will make investments behind the commercialization of Reduced-Risk Products, roll out
Marlboro Red 2.0, and incur some underlying costs related to the optimization of our manufacturing footprint. Overall,
our spending this year is skewed towards the second half. As a result, we are anticipating a lower EPS growth,
excluding currency, for the second half of this year.
As we announced at our Investor Day in June and reaffirmed today, our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2014, at
prevailing exchange rate, is in the range of $4.87 to $4.97 versus $5.26 in 2013. Our guidance continues to include
approximately $0.61 per share of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates, and after-tax charge of $0.24 per
share recorded as asset impairment and exit cost in the second quarter related to the discontinuation of cigarette
production in the Netherlands in 2014 and a $0.01 per share charge recorded in the first quarter relating to the decision
to end production in Australia.
Our 2014 guidance represents a growth rate, excluding currency and these restructuring charges, of approximately 6%
to 8% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.40 in 2013. As stated in June, given the down-trading and heavy
price discounting in Australia, in combination with plain packaging, we anticipated that this could result in our
currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS being at the lower end of this range.
Let me now provide you with an update on key markets, starting with the challenges we faced this year in a number of
Asian markets and the progress we are making in addressing them.
In Japan, cigarette industry volume declined by 14.4% in the quarter as the trade de-stocked following the April 1st
tax-driven price increases. Our shipment volume decreased by 16.4%, reflecting the overall market decline and our
lower market share. On a June year-to-date basis, industry volume declined by 2.8%. As expected, our market share in
Japan rebounded during the second quarter, reaching 26.4% following our 25.5% share in the first quarter when the
trade build up higher inventory levels of competitive product.
Adjusting for trade inventory movements, we estimate our share in the quarter was 25.8%, indicating that the process
of stabilizing our market share is under way and we believe that our share should level out during the second half, a
period during which we plan a number of new product launches, including Marlboro Clear Hybrid, a smooth-tasting
regular-to-menthol capsule product.
In Indonesia, we witnessed a rebound in cigarette industry volume, with a second quarter increase of 4.9%, which
brought the first half of the year to a 2% growth rate. We are currently maintaining our forecast for the full year of
market growth of up to 1%. Our market share increased sequentially from 34.6% in the first quarter to 34.9% in the
second quarter, so it was below the last year's level of 36.1%.

While the unfavorable trends in the hand-rolled kretek segment continue to impact our overall share performance, the
decline moderated, and we achieved strong share progression in the machine-made kretek segment. This was helped by
the April launch of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue which each a quarterly share of 0.6%. We expect this sequential
improvement to continue during the second half of this year.
Total estimated tax-paid cigarette industry volume in the Philippines declined by 13.4% during the second quarter
while consumption levels remained resilient as measured by adult smoking incidence and daily consumption. The drop
in tax-paid industry volume reflects the fact that Mighty Corporation's tax-paid volume was down by around 40%. In
contrast, we estimate that its total sales volume of tax-paid and non-tax-paid increased by about 20%.
PMI's share of the tax-paid market increased to 85.9% during the second quarter, representing an increase of 3.4 share
points, driven mainly by Marlboro and Fortune. The pressure on Mighty Corporation continues and we hope that the
introduction of tax stickers now expected in August will reduce its ability to avoid paying excise taxes and VAT.
Let me now move to Australia, were the combination of a certain commoditization of the market induced by plain
packaging, large excise tax increases, and heavy price discounting, particularly at the bottom of the market, has
accelerated down-trading to lower-priced, lower-margin brands or even illicit product. The super-low-priced segment
has grown from 6.3% in 2011 to 28.3% in the first half of this year, when the effective price gap between a premium
brand, such as Marlboro, and a super-low-priced brand such as Bond Street, widened to about AUD 8 per pack of 25
cigarettes, or about 36%. This compares to a gap of about 26% in 2011.
Our market share averaged 37.7% in the period of 2011 through 2013, but came under significant pressure from
competitive discounting in the first quarter of 2014 when it dropped to 32.9%. We responded with increased investment
and in tactical price discounts for Choice and Bond Street in order to regain our market position. As a result, in the
second quarter, we increased our segment shares in the low and the super-low-priced segment from 31.4% and 11.2%
last year to 36.8% and 14.5% respectively. However, the combination of increased price discounts and volume mix
deterioration due to the down-trading is impacting our profitability in Australia this year.
Let me now turn to the EEMA region, starting with Russia, where our strong and diverse brand portfolio is driving
market share gains and enabling us to increase prices. On a May quarter-to-date basis, our market share increased by
0.9 share points to 26.8% thanks to premium Parliament, mid-priced L&M, and low-priced Bond Street. We estimate
that cigarette industry volume declined by around 10% during the second quarter. This was driven by price increases,
averaging some 25% year-on-year and increase in the prevalence of illicit trade and the weakening economy.
As you know, we announced in May a further price increase of RUB 4 per pack across most of our portfolio. This
should impact adult smokers later this month, and along with the implementation of the restrictions on public smoking
that were introduced in June this year, is expected to result in a full-year decline of between 9% and 11% in cigarette
industry volume.
In Turkey, cigarette industry volume increased by an estimated 2.5% in the second quarter and was slightly up June
year-to-date. A stable underlying trend is expected during the second half of the year despite the mid-year upward
adjustment in the specific and minimum excise tax of 5.1%. We increased the prices of our low and super-low-price
portfolio, Bond Street, Chesterfield, Lark and L&M by TRY 0.50 per pack.
Our May quarter-to-date market share was marginally lower at 44.6%. However, the premium brands share of our
portfolio increased, driven by the 1.2 share point gain by Parliament, which reached a record market share of 10.8%.
Let me now turn to the EU region, where June cigarette industry volume was stronger than expected and included a
favorable inventory volume. Cigarette industry volume declined by just 1.2% in the second quarter and by 3.4% in the
first half, compared to a 9.3% decrease during the same period last year. The improvement in cigarette industry volume
trends has taken place despite persistently high unemployment levels. We attribute the moderation to a slight decline in
illicit trade, a slowdown in the growth of e-vapor products in many markets, relatively less out-switching to fine cut
product and some trade inventory movement.

We should also remember that the comparison with 2013 was easier in the first half of this year. And in addition, we
have recently implemented or announced price increases in Germany, Portugal and Spain. Consequently, we're
expecting the full-year decline in the EU region to be approximately 5%, which is a more modest rate of decline than
the one forecast in June and a marked improvement on the 7.4% decline that occurred during 2013.
We continue to outperform the industry in the EU region. Our regional market share increased by 0.9 share points in
the second quarter to 40.4%. We achieved share growth in five of the six largest markets in the region and expect our
positive momentum to continue throughout the year. Absent trade inventory movement, our market share would also
have been up in Germany.
Our strong share performance is based on the strength of our key international brands. Marlboro remained resilient,
with a 19.4% regional share despite the continued weak macro economic environment. L&M grew by 0.3 share points
to 7.2%, driven by an outstanding performance in Germany and continued share gains in Poland. Chesterfield
performed particularly well, gaining 1.4 share points in the quarter to reach a regional share of 5.8%. This market share
has grown very rapidly since we repositioned the brand in Italy and it has also benefited from geographic expansion.
On a June year-to-date basis, our cigarette volume in the EU region was essentially stable at 91.6 billion units. This was
the key driver of the improvement in our adjusted OCI, excluding currency, during the first half of the year. Our pricing
variance, on the other hand, was lower than in recent years, mainly driven by Italy, where we remain cautiously
optimistic that the government will implement excise tax reform. In the second quarter, we increased our market share
in Italy by the 2 share points to reach 55.3%, as Chesterfield, which was repositioned in February to the super-low price
segment, achieved a 10% overall market share, up by 6.5 share points, although with lower unit margins. While
Marlboro shares declined 0.8 share points to 25%.
On a global basis, pricing remains a key driver of our higher adjusted OCI during the second quarter. Our pricing
variance reached $494 million in the quarter and $900 million in the first half, broadly in line with our annual historical
average of $1.8 billion. Our strong second quarter pricing variance was led by Indonesia and Russia, but was partially
offset by unfavorable pricing variances in Italy and the Philippines. We achieved a 2.1 point improvement in PMI's
adjusted operating companies income margin, excluding currency, in the second quarter, driven by pricing and helped
by the timing of costs.
Looking at our top 30 OCI markets worldwide, our share in the second quarter of 2014 increased by 0.2 points to
37.3%. Marlboro is one of the key drivers of our favorable market share momentum. During the second quarter,
Marlboro progressed to reach an international market share of 9.2% excluding China. It gained share in three out of our
four regions, with a particularly strong performance in the EEMA region. The decline in the Asia region was mainly
attributable to Japan.
We remain committed to generously rewarding our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share
repurchases. Our dividend yield last Friday was 4.4%, which puts us at the upper end of the range of our peer groups.
During the second quarter, we spent $1 billion to repurchase 11.6 million shares at an average price of $86.13 and
continue to target spending of $4 billion during the full year of 2014.
In conclusion, the second quarter was financially a strong one, helped by a favorable comparison with last year and
hindered by some ongoing challenges in the Asia region. The results in the EEMA and Latin America & Canada
regions were particularly strong, driven mainly by pricing, while better volume trends in the EU region enabled us to
increase regional adjusted OCI excluding currency.
Our business fundamentals are solid, although the comparisons are expected to be more challenging during the next
two quarters. We'll make investments behind the commercialization of Reduced-Risk Product, roll out Marlboro Red
2.0, incur some underlying cost related to the optimizations of our manufacturing footprint. And overall, our spending
this year is skewed towards the second half.
This is already reflected in our EPS guidance and we remain confident in our ability to achieve a growth rate in
adjusted diluted EPS of 6% to 8%, excluding currency, for the full year of 2014.

Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: A couple of things. First of all, I realize you haven't changed your outlook for the year. But
did the second quarter come in higher than the internal plan or was this what you more or less had envisioned?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, this came as per our plan. We knew when we had highlighted at the beginning of the year
that we expect particular strong quarter, partly driven by the comps. As you remember, the growth rate in the second
quarter of last year was 0.7% on EPS level, ex-currency, so it was not really challenging comp which we were facing.
But also, we knew that we will expect some continued step-by-step improvements in the key markets which we try to
address this year. So you had the EU, Japan, Philippines, et cetera, so this all was baked in. So it came as expected.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. Secondly, two of your three major international competitors intend to make fairly
sizable investments in the U.S. cigarette market, the conventional cigarette market. And I'm just curious, you obviously
exited that market, but do their actions cause you to rethink at all the attraction and/or the risk of the U.S.?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, not really. I think we make it very clear that the reasons are well-known why we focused
on an international market. We're not looking in a conventional business at the U.S. I think our plans are very clear that,
yes, we do see U.S. from the perspective of the Reduced-Risk Product. But that's a separate part of the strategy. So
when it comes to the conventional cigarette market, I don't really see any impact in terms of our thinking of that
transaction which was, I believe, announced yesterday.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. Thank you very much, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So, a couple of questions. First, in the EU region, obviously, you had called out the pricing
variance being negatively impacted by the price repositioning in Italy. So just wondering, number one, can you just
quantify the Italy impact and whether the underlying – the other markets, the pricing variances also slowed? And then
you've taken some pricing in some of the European markets, so would you expect pricing variance in the back half for
EU to be much stronger?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: On Italy, I think the Chesterfield repositioning, obviously, generated some negative pricing
variance on the Italian market, but this is largely offset by the volume gains. So I think Italy is more the question of the
VAT absorption, which we still have since the end of the last year and this is causing the negative pricing variance.
And this is very much linked to the way it is discussed or debated in Italy, the tax restructuring.

Italy, to quantify, the total pricing variance for Italy would be in a range, on the year-to-date basis, you're talking in a
range of about $100 million. But as I said, it's more – the higher component is the VAT absorption than just the
repositioning of the Chesterfield because you pick it up at the revenue level for the positive volume variance.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Right. Okay. And then other markets where you're taking – or have taken more pricing, so
broadly speaking, if you take total EU in the back half, pricing variance would accelerate more meaningfully?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, just to conclude in Italy, if you would add to the pricing variance on the EU, the negative
coming from Italy, the EU would have already a pretty decent pricing variance for the first half of the year, okay,
because Italy really depressed the pricing, the variance for the entire region. And I think overall for the PMI, the pricing
variance is about equally spread between the halves of the year.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay. And then the second question is relating to the situation in Australia and I wanted
to just get a little bit better understanding of what actions you have actually taken already in that market and whether
there are more actions to come in the back half and just if you're detecting any sort of competitive responses now that
you've responded to that competitive behavior in that market?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, what we did in Australia is as of the end of the first quarter, essentially, we have increased
some promotional spending, price promotional spending behind, namely two brands, Choice and Bond Street, which
are the brands which are competing in the low-price segment, in the upper part of the low-price segment, and they're
being challenged by the discount segment or the lower part of that segment; so the investment there and our actions
around this, when we try to regain the competitiveness when it comes to the price point versus the key competitive
brands.
This is a free pricing in Australia, so the situation is pretty dynamic. You need to appreciate that I cannot comment on
any future price moves, but this is a price-discounting situation when the price is being set individually by the key
accounts, by trade channel, by territory, et cetera. So I mean that situation may change and may turn – may change
pretty rapidly. So we will have to see.
I mean, I think our share reacted as expected. We regained the share especially behind these brands in the quarter. As
you remember, we lost some share, significantly some share in the first quarter. So, so far that part of the strategy
works. Now, we'll see how the situation will develop.
I think what is maybe important to say that you have some brands already in the market discounted in the low-price
segment there to the level that they essentially yield about zero margin, okay? So I think, once you reach that point, I
think a fair question to ask is, isn't that the moment when the logic should start prevailing, while you start balancing
your profit versus volume objective.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Right. Okay. Got it. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I just had two questions for you, if I could. The first would be, if you look at the
EU, the first half benefited from some inventory movements. How much of that reverses in the second half of the year?
I guess, with the volumes being much stronger so far, do you have to – would you see a sort of major inventory
reductions occurring in the second half of the year?

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Small component. I think it was mainly in Germany, but you're not talking about a very
important component. So yes, there will be obviously some reversal in Q3, but I don't think it would change our
outlook when it comes for the full year. Hence, as you noticed, we have revised, shortly after Investors Day, while now
having a full year data, we have revised our total industry outlook for the EU to the 5%.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Again, obviously, there being some inventories movement between the quarters.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then just another question for you, if I could, on Japan, which is that
obviously the share of shipments was up in the quarter, but it also was distorted by inventory movement. So I'm just
curious, is there a better metric, a better measure for the ongoing share, if you will, in Japan this quarter? 26.4%, is that
sustainable or...?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The way we're tracking the performance, we look at the retail offtake at some key chains there,
but the share performance there is somehow reflecting the trend with sequential trends, which we see on our adjusted
share. So we see the stabilization of the share over the last three quarters maybe 0.1% down sequentially Q2 versus Q1,
but this all points into what we expected that in the second half the year, we should is essentially have Japan share
pressure behind us.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thanks for your time.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: My first question is on the Philippines. So despite progress being made with the tax
underpayment issue by your main competitor, the market was still down quite a bit in the second quarter. So how do
you see this playing out for the rest of the year and when should we expect the market to stabilize? And also, do you
think the tax stamps coming in, I think it sounds like in August now, will fix or address the bulk of these problems?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The market, we'll have to be cautious when we talk about the total market size in Philippines,
because we essentially have a better visibility on a tax-paid market rather than on a total market. Therefore, I think also
in our slides, we're using the data on the consumption, the smoking incidence and the daily consumption, which gives a
better feel what is happening to the total market, covering both tax-paid, non-tax-paid. I think there is the distortion
coming a little bit from what has happened Q2 last year with Mighty supplying the market and the Mighty level of
supplying the market second quarter of this year. Hence, you have a 14% decline.
When it comes to second question, I think the tax stickers implementation is a important step in the whole portfolio of
the steps which we wish the government should have already taken to address that issue. I don't think tax stamps is the
only element which is going to address that issue. When we're dealing with an under-declaration, you need to obviously
demonstrate the same diligence and vigilance when it comes to auditing the tax stickers, et cetera. But we're very
pleased that this is coming to its fruition, into realization and I think it's going to help in overall addressing the
situation.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, that's helpful. And then I do have a second question on Russia. Could you give us a
little more color on how Marlboro is performing in that country? And then, in light of the price increases you took,
could you talk about where price gaps are now and are you seeing any changes in consumer behavior giving the

increases and then possibly from some of the smoking bans?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, when it comes to the price gaps, because Russia essentially is having a price increases, the
same absolute amount per pack across the price segment, so it's not much change of price gaps in absolute terms, but
obviously the price gaps in relative terms tend to close. When it comes to consumer reaction, the price increase which
we announcing in May, as I said in my remarks, will hit the markets around this time early August. So we'll have to
wait a month or so to have the reading how consumer, what is the reaction of consumers. I think we shouldn't change
our outlook for the market, total market size for this year. I think this 9% to 11% range of decline for this year is valid.
We factored in the impact of the two price increases this year and also in this forecast is factored in the impact from
smoking restriction in public places.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. Thank you, Jacek.

Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, good morning.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Good morning. A couple of questions. Firstly, following on in Russia, I was just
wondering if you could confirm that you're still seeing substantial up-trading, because it looks like Bond Street was
actually taking a bit more share, say relative to Parliament. And then related to that, I was wondering two things, what
you're estimating is the effect from the greater smoking restrictions or is that going to be relatively modest and how are
you characterizing the risk of a greater tax increase than in the current rolling two-year plan say in next year or in
2016?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Up-trading in Russia, I mean because you're talking about the market which has a relatively high
absolute and relative price gaps, so the up-trading is better – you see up-trading is better when it comes to the two
segments next to each other and I think you'll still see up-trading in the market. So it's not a straight up-trading from the
lower-price products going to the premium product. But in the segments next to each other, I think you'll see some
uptick in the volume, hence the performance of Parliament and also performance of our brands. I mean, usually our
brands will tend to occupy the upper part of each respective segment.
The smoking ban, I would say like this, we have experienced in other markets some implementation of a similar
regulation, similar restriction. Yes, you have some impact at the beginning. Usually, it comes to moderation later on
when consumer adjusts to the new consumption pattern or accommodate the fact that there might be places or
occasions when they cannot freely smoke.
As I said, this is all factored in our 9% to 11% forecast for the total volume decline and the key driver behind this 9% to
11% is the price increases on the back of excise increases which we are taking this year. So most of this 9% to 11% is
the elasticity-driven impact on the total market rather than coming from a smoking restriction.
And the third part of your question, we have now the second year where Russia is dealing – or the Russian government
is approaching the taxation of the cigarette market through this three-year plan. Every year, the rates are getting
reconfirmed around November, I think, in their legislative process, I mean the Duma and the Cabinet. Every year, they
reconfirm the next two years and they bring a rate for the third year in the plan, it's a rolling-over plan. So we'll see how
they reconfirm the rate this year.
I mean, so far, the government was very pragmatic in setting this rate. On the one hand, balancing their desire to
increase the tax level, but on the other hand, recognizing the unintended consequences, namely the illicit trade, which
they wouldn't like to have in that market, quite rightly. So, so far, I don't see anything which would change my opinion

why the Russian government should not act pragmatically this time. But let's see. I mean, we'll have to wait until
November.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Okay. Thank you. And then just a short follow-on on Australia, where do you see the low
and super-low-priced segments stabilizing as a percentage of the market? Were you looking at those continuing to rise
over time? Or do you think that they'll kind of reach a natural ceiling and then stabilize?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, the prices in Australia overall, the cigarette prices in Australia are pretty high. But I haven't
seen another market of comparable maturity, when the low or super-low-priced segment will take it all. I mean, there is
always medium segment, there is always a premium segment. Usually, the markets may go into polarization, so it's
more the question of the medium brands slowly being eroded by the low/super-low-priced segment and the premium
somehow holds its position. I mean, obviously in Australia, we have to take it through the lenses of the plain packaging
and some equity, presumably, erosion of the brands. But I don't think it's a zero-one game, that the whole market is
going to go to the discount segment.

Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell with Exane.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Hi. Thanks and good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - James Bushnell>: I have firstly a question on Europe, please. Firstly, could you give a bit more detail on the
price increase in Germany? I think previously you'd raise prices and then pull one, so just how much is that and does it
differ by brand at all? And also, what do you see as the outlook for pricing in Europe as we go through the rest of the
year? Clearly, you've outlined that Italy is a drag, but what about elsewhere, would we expect that to improve in H2?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: In Germany, the price increase was on average €0.20 per pack. As you remember, Germany has
various stick counts per pack sizes, right, the pack of 19s and the larger pack boxes. So per pack in an individual SKU,
the price might be slightly different. But on average, it's €0.20 across the portfolio in Marlboro to the low price, the
lower-priced L&M and Chesterfield.
When it comes to pricing in Europe, again, I think we should look a little bit at the pricing in Europe excluding Italy,
because Italy is really dragging the price in Europe low. And I said earlier, answering, I think, one of the questions that
the pricing impact of Italy is in the range of about, in the tune to $100 million for the first six months of this year. And
that's significant, you will add it back to the realized pricing and you'll see that the pricing in Europe is not as being
perceived by some that we're falling a little bit behind.
In all other markets, the pricing was taking, a lot of pricing was taken at the beginning of the year, usually around the
tax rate increases. That's especially the case in Central Europe. Poland, I said during the remarks today, we've recently
took also on pricing in Portugal and Spain. So I think the pricing in Europe, we have to take a little bit a different view
on Italy and the rest, because the rest of Europe, in my opinion, is not looking as low as one could think.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Okay, thank you. And just to come back on the Germany price increase, do I assume that that's
slightly different to your previous increase that was then pulled back in terms of price caps between different size packs
or is it the same?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. I think – no, I think it's the same principle. I don't want to say it's 100% the same, because
maybe there is some completely irrelevant fine-tuning on one or two SKUs, but it's the same principle. It's €0.20 across
the board, on average.

<Q - James Bushnell>: Okay, thank you. And just, my second question was just on Korea. What from your
perspective is the likelihood of a tax rise anytime soon and if it is an 80% rise in average prices, which is one of the
proposals that we've had, do you think that would still be good news after any short-term disruption?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Taking into consideration that no one almost remembers when Korea raised their tax last time, I
think this would be good news. But we'll have to see how it unfolds. I mean, we've heard in the past also some rumors
or some initiatives even to raise the taxes in Korea and this has not materialized. I think myself, I am more cautious
about when Korea will have a tax increase, but we'll have to see.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Hello.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi. Good morning.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Just a few questions on Indonesia. I'm curious with the 2% first half category growth and
with the easier comparisons in the back half why you expect the deceleration in the second half basically flat, to give
the 1% category growth. Is there some kind of headwind you expect or consumer pressures, or how do you see that
unfolding?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean, we see so – at the beginning of the year, first half of the year some deceleration in
the GDP growth. So we're always looking at the macros in order to feel more comfortable with the total industry
outlook. But I agree that 2% year-to-date growth rate for the market versus our forecast of 1%, one could say that there
is a potential for an upside. And I would have to confirm there is a potential for an upside. I think I need one more
quarter or at least one or two more months to reconfirm that Indonesia is moving still -the total market is moving to the
better growth rate. I mean it's good news for us, but I think I was very clear in the remarks that despite the fact that the
market is year-to-date 2%, we're still seeing for the 1% growth for the full year.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: And then just looking at your market share, you've got the 60 basis point decline in Dji Sam
Soe and the 60 basis point share from Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue, so obviously that nets to zero. And you've got the
increase over 1 point in U Mild, only slightly offset by Marlboro. But your total share is down over 1 point, so how do
we reconcile that? Is Dji Sam Soe Magnum, the non-Blue down pretty significantly?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. Dji Sam Soe in the machine-made, both Dji Sam Soe's Magnum and the Magnum Blue in
the machine-made segment, it's actually growing as expected very nicely, so increasing our share in the machine-made
part of the market. Dji Sam Soe in the hand-rolled version, the challenge is, on the one hand, is consumer going to the
machine-made, but the prime challenge which the brand faces this year is the price point, right, it's above the ground
price point, while the competitors are approaching, but it's still technically slightly below that price point. So I think in
Q3, we should see that sort of a headwind for the Dji Sam Soe to being removed.
And one more comment, if I may. When you look at the Marlboro share in Indonesia, this is all weighted to the total
market, right, by the white cigarette market, a non-kretek market and a kretek market, but not necessarily
highly-interlinked markets within the one cigarette market. So I mean, you'll have sometimes the fluctuations on the
Marlboro share just because the total market growth, which happened last quarter, came obviously through the kretek
as the main driver. So the weight of the kretek market may sometimes give you fluctuations on the Marlboro share.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: That's helpful. Thanks. And then on the hand-rolled price points, have you seen a better
balancing in how the competition looks? I know some of those have crossed the same IDR 1,000, but it's a little
scattered sort of regionally or by channels and things like that. So is that looking like that's more consistent now across
the competition?

<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, this is as we predicted, that there will be a – there's a time we need [indiscernible] (42:42) in
the region by region, et cetera, these brands or the SKUs will go and cross this price point. So some have already
reached, crossed; some are still hanging slightly below. I think the Q3, as we predicted initially, is about the time when
the Dji Sam Soe should have that price point pressure behind it rather than in front of it.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. No, that's great. And then just last question on Indonesia, you mentioned in the
release, how optimizing production contributed higher costs, but certainly it seems like if you're optimizing production
that would be a better cost profile. So is it right to assume those are one-time and how significant was that and is that
behind you now?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: In Indonesia optimization of production is essentially to manage the capacity between our
hand-rolled capacity and the machine-made capacity. So it's a little bit different than the optimizations which we
undertook in Australia and in Holland, in Bergen op Zoom. That's it, so they will have some costs associated with
managing the hand-rolled capacity, transforming the hand-rolled capacity into machine-made capacity.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Well, I guess I'm just trying to understand what that is. Do you have an ongoing cost? Do
you just have idle factories of people making hand-rolled that aren't producing as – I mean, what's the cost that hit in
this quarter? Is it a one-time plant closure cost? Or is it something ongoing?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: These are the costs associated with the downsizing. So they don't really qualify into reporting
adjustments. Therefore, we have not carved it out in our reconciliations from reported to adjusted results. They sit in
our underlying numbers. But the cost is essentially about what we need to, unfortunately it results with the termination
of the employment of hand-rollers and they're smaller and creating a capacity on the machine in the factories, which are
producing machine-made cigarettes
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. No, that's helpful. So even if we keep it in the adjusted number, can you give me any
sense of what the magnitude is in terms of how to think about the comparison next year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, but what we have done is, if you remember, not in the case of Indonesia, but if you
remember in Q1 of this year, we have said that our cost associated with the closure of the plant in Australia would be
$0.03 out of $1 was recorded in Q1, which was a reporting adjustment, and the $0.02 which we'll pick up later on, but
not as a reporting adjustment. Now I'll have costs, which also I am incurring some costs which do not qualify by U.S.
GAAP rules as the reporting adjustments, I will incur these costs this year in order to complete this project. So in total,
if I take all the projects together in my underlying result, you're talking about the $0.02 to $0.04, which I associated
with the cost of a closure or adjusting the – or factory, the footprint and the capacity optimization.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: This is underlying. This is not part of the reporting adjustment.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Right. Okay. And then just on the Netherlands plant closure, that's scheduled, I believe, for
September 1. If that goes as planned, some of that benefit would come in fourth quarter of this year, correct?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Very small. I don't think – this will not be material, because you'll need to take September 1,
relocation of the production, you obviously have the inventory, in the meantime, which were already produced, et
cetera. So this will not materially impact – we'll pick up a full impact of both, of Bergen op Zoom restructuring next
year, 2015.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: So it would lag, even if the plant is closed for three or four months later this year, there
wouldn't be a savings benefit really in 2014?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, but I will have, as I mentioned before, I will have also some costs associated with the closure
of the plant which are in my underlying results. So the net-net of that project, you will not see the material impact of
that thing. Actually, I will be more out-weighted on the cost than the benefit which I may pick up for the, literally, few
weeks of this year.

<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: That's helpful. Thanks. And then I know Australia has been covered a bit, but just one last
question there, if we can. Can you just help us understand some of the dynamics? It seemed like even with plain
packaging coming in, there wasn't any real issues over the first kind of 13 months during last year and when it started in
December. And now, certainly, it looks like it's a different picture in 2014. What started all this? I mean, what was kind
of the trigger that made the issues for you become something you would call out? And is it directly related to plain
packaging, value brand erosion happening maybe more quickly than people might have thought? Or can you just
explain some of what started all this?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean, what started – when they start discounting, it was much earlier in the market than
the plain packaging. So the market always was characterizing by some level of discounting, when people were
essentially were buying down the price for the consumer at the retail level. What we have observed towards the end of
the last year, frankly speaking, that it was an increased discounting activity by some of our competitors. So when we
look at our share erosions, which I think was pretty visible in the first quarter, it was obvious decision, we had to react,
stay competitive, and not allow the share to further decline.
So yes, there is obviously the element of the plain packaging in the whole thing, but I think we couldn't just attribute
the current situation entirely to plain packaging. But plain packaging clearly, by the fact that somebody took away your
trademarks, erodes the equity of my brand, erode the equity of my product. So there is an element of that thing, how
much you would attribute to this. I mean it's difficult to say at this stage. You cannot ignore it, but this is not the only
element which is happening there.
This is all in the context of a very significant tax increases which took, historically, in the last year and also will happen
this year in the market. Because last year, September, you had a 12.5% excise tax increase. In September of this year,
we will have another 12.5% additional excise tax increase. That obviously makes – and the year after, so it makes a
significant price – it drives to the significant price increases. And obviously, as the market already has a cigarette at the
price of average of about $17 per a pack of 25, of the 25 cigarettes, you have an actual sort of a tendency to go into the
down-trading, which can be further fueled if you activate discounting because you open the gap.
Maybe, if you look at the market and you realize that the price gaps are in the range of $6, $8, I mean, that's the price
level per pack in many other markets. And in Australia, we have the price gaps of that magnitude. Obviously, because
the underlying prices per pack are already pretty high. But the $6 or $8, sort of the erosion in the mix is already pretty
significant.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay, great, thank you very much.

<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi. Good morning.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Just a quick one. I was just wondering on the EEMA top line performance how much of this
was driven by the change in Egypt business structure. And how long will this benefit continue before it lapsed or was it
more a one-off influence in the quarter? Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay. There is an impact of Egypt, obviously, because of the business structure, but there is an
underlying problem in Egypt and the entire – the very strong quarter for the region, very much driven by the price,
came not only from Russia, but came from North Africa, some other markets than Egypt; Egypt played a critical role,
but this is in addition of us now reporting Egypt differently due to the business structure change this year.

Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Vivien.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: In terms of the improvement in the EU, I appreciate fully that you are waiting to get the full
June results before you have the confidence to raise your guidance for the region. I was curious if you could speak to
the sequential trends through the quarter and if there was any one or two key markets that really kind of drove the
improved outlook relative to what you'd offered at your Analyst Day?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Just to clarify, we don't give the guidance at the segment level, Vivien. So we're giving an
outlook when it comes to total market, right?
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Certainly, yeah.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: But no, I mean, if we look at the June results, the markets which we – I mean all of the markets
essentially confirmed what we've seen over the last five, six, seven months depends on the market trends. If you look at
the total market trend, there are three markets which are today somehow lagging behind in terms that their decline rates
should be better, i.e., lower than the entire region. One of these markets is France, so we have to watch it, but I don't
think it's going to change dramatically total EU picture. And the two other markets are relatively smaller markets, it's
Greece and Hungary. So I have three markets which I wish would follow the trend line of the rest of the region, but
even in absence of this, I think EU is, as we announced today in my remarks, EU outlook for the full year is closer, is
around 5% and it's based on the sequential improvements which we saw.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Excellent. Well, that's certainly good news. Just to follow up quickly on Indonesia. I
appreciate why you're holding your guidance, I think that makes a lot of sense. I was curious whether embedded in that
was an outlook for any change in the fuel subsidy? I know we're still waiting to see how the presidential election
unfolds, as they count the ballots, but it does seem like that might be a reality in that market very late into 2014.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: To my recollections, there is not much – I haven't – I don't really recall there was a discussion
about any changes to the fuel subsidies recently, unless I missed something, but I don't think so. I mean the presidential
elections, we'll have to see how that unfolds and what's the new direction, political direction there.
No, I was much more – we are much more looking into the GDP development, the pricing development, et cetera. And
based on this, we're trying, to best of our knowledge, to estimate the market growth. But as I indicated a moment
before, I do admit that with a 2% year-to-date, our 1% outlook is maybe too cautious, but we'll have to see. I mean, this
market is a market which has a lot of stick sales, the level of sales and the consumption can pretty rapidly change in
these places, so we will have to see.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Yeah. That makes sense. And lastly, maybe it is still too early, but I was wondering
whether you wanted, could offer any commentary as you go into your city tests on iQOS, can you dimensionalize for us
how you're thinking about the pricing of the iQOS system relative to other competitive novel tobacco systems in their
respective markets of Japan and Italy?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: You know me, I am a great fan of iQOS. I am using this product. I wish I could share this with
you, but I can't.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Fair enough.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: One thing when we talk about the iQOS, which is also to explain a little bit our cost variance this
year and I know that I am bridging from your questions to something else, but it is important to remember that the two
test markets on iQOS will happen in Q4 this year. So ok and, this obviously will also contribute, one of the contributing

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Hello. Thank you very much for taking the question.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Good morning. It's a question about Italy and the outlook for changes in the tax situation
there. Now I believe or I've seen that there was an announcement I think in the last day or two of what I believe is a
very small increase in tax, but an increased nonetheless. And I was wondering, first of all, if you could just confirm that
I'm right, that it's pretty marginal? And secondly and perhaps more importantly, to comment if you can about how you
think and when you think there will be a substantial change in the tax situation in Italy? Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: You're absolutely right. There was a very small, almost cosmetic sort of a change, which resulted
in I think 0.1% – not think, I know, it's a 0.1% incidence increase. They increased, the specific, the minimum excise tax
on cigarettes by €1 and the minimum excise tax on the fine cut products by €3. So this is sort of a legacy coming from
still last year and just Italy was pretty late in translating this into the tax rate. This has nothing to do with the tax
restructuring which now we're understanding is that the government is debating as we speak, so we will see how that
unfolds. I mean I think there are a number of people who are recognizing that the tax structure which Italy has today is
pretty archaic. It doesn't stand to the market requirements, both on the governmental revenues side, very much on the
governmental revenues side, but also on the overall market.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: When would you expect to have news on a substantial reform?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, because it is Italy, the expectations with regards to time, you have to be pretty flexible,
right.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Okay. But this calendar year, I guess?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: As I said, it's Italy, so we will have to...we will have to see.
