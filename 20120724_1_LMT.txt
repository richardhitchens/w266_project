Robert J. Stevens
Thanks, Jerry. Thanks, everyone, for being with us today. We'll proceed on the assumption that you've had an
opportunity to review our releases this morning.
Since we last spoke in April, we've undertaken a fair amount of international travel to talk directly with our customers
and government leaders, consistent with our strategy to increase our international work while we rebalance national
security spending here in the United States. While all governments are clearly watching the global economic
environment, all are keenly aware of growing security challenges.
As we assess our portfolio, we believe we possess the systems, the capabilities, the skills and the resources to support
our security cooperation partners around the globe, and I was very gratified to see strong, broad-based operational
performance in the second quarter throughout the company based on solid execution and disciplined focus. We believe
our portfolio gives us opportunities to continue to expand international sales.
Relative to the government fiscal year 13' defense budget, the House has marked in committee both a Defense
Authorization Bill and all 12 appropriation bills, including defense; and the Senate has marked a Defense Authorization
Bill in committee and will likely mark the Defense Appropriation Bill by the end of this month.
At this point, however, we do not expect the bills to be in place at the beginning of the government's fiscal year on
October the 1st, but rather have a continuing resolution that will commence on 1 October and likely extend through the
end of the calendar year, enabling the Congress to convene a lame duck session after the election where we believe a
broader number of very important issues like the debt limit extension, entitlement reform, tax policy and spending
levels, together sometimes referred to as the fiscal cliff issues, will be addressed.
Sequestration continues to be of great concern to us. There is, at present, very little insight or detailed understanding as
to how sequestration will be implemented, even though this law requiring an additional $55 billion reduction in both
defense and in non-defense discretionary accounts will take effect January the 2nd, 94 days into the government fiscal
year. Without sufficient planning information, we've been unable to more precisely estimate the adverse impacts and
have petitioned the administration and the Congress to stop sequestration and replace it with a more constructive
process, or if sequestration is to occur, provide the necessary planning information so we can properly and responsibly
prepare to act.
I'll be happy to cover these or any other topics in more detail during our discussion, but first, let's turn to Chris for the
operational report and Bruce for the financials. Chris?
Christopher E. Kubasik
Thanks, Bob. From an operating perspective, we had a very strong quarter in an uncertain and challenging
environment. In the area of new business, we had several multi-year awards that allow us to offer innovative, relevant
and affordable solutions to our customers.
In Electronic Systems, the U.S. Navy awarded a five-year $1 billion contract to provide more than 200 digital cockpits
and integrated systems and sensors for the new MH-60 Romeo and Sierra helicopters. The Navy will realize significant
savings due to the multiyear contracting vehicle.
In Information Systems and Global Solutions, our team continues to build upon their impressive string of competitive
wins over the last six months. We were previously awarded the National Science Foundation and Arctic contract and

the DoD Cyber Crime Center contract. This quarter, we won the Defense Information System Agency contract to
manage the transformation of the DoD's global data network. IS&GS also achieved another milestone with its
recognition as the top IT service provider to the federal government for the 18th consecutive year.
Let me just now turn to some of our key operational achievements in the quarter. Electronic Systems delivered the
second Littoral Combat Ship to Fort Worth. Our team successfully completed acceptance trials and delivered the ship
to the U.S. Navy in June two months ahead of schedule and under cost. Our LCS team achieved another important
milestone when the Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey completed their review of our first ship, the USS Freedom,
and declared the ship fit for duty. I just returned from Singapore and there is much excitement and anticipation for the
USS Freedom arriving next year where it will perform a key role in our new U.S. defense strategy.
Electronic Systems also continue to expand critical capabilities in the growing area of missile defense with intercepts of
targets by two of our systems. Our Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system successfully intercepted a target missile
using the upgraded Aegis system for the first time. Additionally, our PAC-3 Missile successfully intercepted and
destroyed a cruise missile target, demonstrating the unique ability of the system to detect, track and destroy at extended
range.
Missile defense is a growing market internationally and we are well-positioned with our broad portfolio of Aegis,
Patriot, [ph] MEADS and THAD (6:39), along with the related Command and Control and Battle Management
systems. In our Space Systems business, the second Advanced EHF military communications satellite for the U.S. Air
Force was launched, and we delivered two commercial satellites in the quarter.
Let me wrap up with the F-35's status. Overall, the program continues to gain momentum in developmental flight
testing, production activities and international interest. Flight tests on the development program are progressing at a
solid pace. Year-to-date through June, test flights are significantly ahead of plan by 150 flights or 34%, and test points
are also ahead of plan by over 900 points or 24%.
Software development is another area of progress on the program. As we've mentioned on previous calls, software
development is a critically important element of the F-35 program. We discussed some schedule pressures during our
last call, and I'm pleased to report that we are seeing improvements to the schedule. As a further showing of software
maturity and deployment, we began flying the Block 2A software on the first STOVL aircraft in June. This block is
now flying on CTOL and STOVL aircraft.
Production activities are continuing to progress. In our second quarter, we delivered three production aircraft. Since
then, we've delivered seven additional aircraft, bringing year-to-date production deliveries to 12. Included in this total
is the first international aircraft delivered to the United Kingdom. In the area of new production contracts, we were
pleased with the award of $490 million for long lead on LRIP 7 this quarter. This authorization enables procurement
activities to begin for 35 aircraft, and add stability to the supplier base and production line.
Internationally, the F-35 program continued to receive strong support. This quarter, Norway announced their initial
order for two aircraft, which is expected to be followed by up to 50 additional aircraft. After the close of the quarter,
Japan reaffirmed their intentions to purchase the F-35 and signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance to order four initial
aircraft. Additionally, international new business opportunities continue to emerge on the F-35. This past quarter, we
submitted a proposal to supply 60 aircraft to South Korea. The announcement of the winning aircraft is scheduled to
occur before the end of the year.
Overall, the program is demonstrating increasing maturity and tempo, and the global F-35 team looks forward to
providing this critical asset to our nation and allies. With current aircraft deployment of 19 operational aircraft to Eglin
Air Force Base, including the U.K. aircraft, plus eight test aircraft at Patuxent Naval Air Station, six more test aircraft
at Edwards Air Force Base, and just over 70 aircraft in production flow, the F-35 program is making good progress.
With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce to discuss our financials.

Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along the
web charts that we included with our earnings release today.
Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of the second quarter. We grew sales for the company by 3% versus the
second quarter of 2011. I'll describe the drivers behind that growth on the next chart. Our segment operating profit
margins improved by 60 basis points to 12.3%, and I'll also provide more color on that improvement in a couple of
charts. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 10% driven by the higher sales volume and margin
improvements. We generated $845 million in cash from operations while contributing more than $600 million into our
pension plans. This amount completes the $1.1 billion in required contributions for the year. And as you saw on our
earnings release, we've increased our outlook for operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations.
On chart 4, we'll look at sales by the four business areas. As in the first quarter, sales were slightly ahead of our
expectations with three of our four business areas growing. Aeronautics grew 1% in the quarter led by additional
quantities of F-16 deliveries. This growth was dampened by the labor strike in Fort Worth, particularly on the F-35
program.
Electronic Systems had 2% in the quarter driven by our Mission Systems and Sensors business unit, which had higher
volume for our Persistent Threat Detection System or PTDS, along with higher activity on our LCS and MH-60
programs.
Space Systems had significant growth in the quarter driven by the delivery of two commercial satellites versus none in
the second quarter last year. We also had higher volume on the Orion program compared with last year. And finally,
IS&GS declined by 4% driven mostly by a reduction in sales for the AMF JTRS program. As with the first quarter,
IS&GS's sales reduction was less than we had expected with continuing growth in our intelligence line of business,
particularly in federal cyber activity, helping to lessen the decline.
Chart 5 shows the segment margin levels for each of the four business areas. The primary reason for the overall margin
increase to 12.3% was due to improvements in our Aeronautics and Electronic Systems business areas. I'd like to
discuss these in a little more detail. Within Aeronautics, there were several factors that resulted in a 13.3% margin in
the quarter that warrant additional discussion. First, we reduced our profit booking rate for the F-35 SDD contract from
just over 4% to just under 4%, which yielded [ph] an exception (12:34) to date $85 million reduction in profit in the
quarter. While we had previously assumed a decremented amount for the remaining fee would be earned, this
adjustment reduces that amount even more. We've made this adjustment as there is currently no plan in place for the
government for how over $500 million of remaining fee can be earned and we are nearing the point where the amount
of profit recorded would exceed the amount of fees received to date on the contract.
In addition, we have been disappointed recently with the amount of fee available to be earned for developmental
milestones and the government's evaluations of our performance against those milestones compared with our own
assessment. Importantly, because of where we are from [ph] Versent (13:20) complete basis on the development
contract, the vast majority of the profit adjustment effects the current year. The lower rate has little incremental impact
on future margins and earnings for Aeronautics. This SDD adjustment was substantially offset by contractual
resolutions on other programs such as the F-22 leaving outstanding performance on our C-130 program, particularly on
our international contracts, as the principal reason for the improved margin performance in the quarter. And as Chris
mentioned, we're pleased with our progress on the F-35 program as a whole.
Looking at the margin for Electronic Systems, the story is similar to Aeronautics. Improved performance on a number
of programs drove the higher margin as contractual resolutions offset [ph] proper rate (14:02) reductions on a few
programs and severance costs for workforce reductions at MS2. Within IS&GS, the higher margin results from a slight
improvement in our Intelligence line of business across a number of contracts and the reduction in the margin of Space
Systems primarily reflects lower equity earnings due to timing in the quarter. Higher earnings associated with risk
retirements on the Orion program helped to partially offset the lower equity earnings.
Turning to chart 6 and our earnings per share in the quarter, EPS from continuing operations grew 10% over the
amount reported last year and adjusting our reported EPS for the effects of the FAS/CAS adjustment increases our

earnings per share to $2.77 per share.
If you'll turn to chart 7, you can see our operating cash flow performance in the quarter compared with last year.
Adjusting for the higher pension contributions we made this year compared with last, our pre pension cash flow was
more than $1.4 billion and after considering the strong performance during the first half of the year and our
expectations for the rest of the year we increased our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to greater than
or equal to $3.9 billion for the year.
On chart 8 we'll discuss our updated guidance. We're maintaining our sales outlook; although, we are updating two of
the business areas within this guidance level, as we'll discuss shortly. We increased segment operating profit by $125
million. We also increased our earnings per share, as I'll detail in the next chart, and again we increased our cash from
operations by $100 million.
Chart 9 shows our EPS outlook reconciliation. The segment operating profit increase added $0.25 to our outlook.
Several items partially offset that increase, making the net increase to our annual EPS $0.20, resulting in a new range of
$7.90 to $8.10 per share.
Chart 10 shows our sales outlook where we lowered Aeronautics by $200 million for the year primarily reflecting the
effects of the strike. About half of the reduction is from lower F-35 volume and the other half is an expected slip of
three F-16 aircraft out of 2012 into 2013. Offsetting this reduction is a $200 million increase in Space Systems
reflecting their strong performance year-to-date.
Chart 11 shows our new segment operating profit guidance. Again the total increase is $125 million with Aeronautics
and Electronic Systems both increasing $50 million for the year while Space Systems increased $25 million.
And finally, we wrap up with our summary on chart 12. We've had an excellent first half of the year, which reflects the
strength of our portfolio and the affordability actions we've taken. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales
will be about $1 billion lower than 2011 results, primarily due to decreases in Aeronautics and Space Systems. We
expect segment operating margins to be comparable to last year's, and cash from operations to exceed $1 billion.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, good morning. Bob, actually a tactical near-term question, and a second strategic question for
you if you don't mind. The Anti-Deficiency Act precludes the government from spending more than Congress
authorizes, and many contracts are incrementally funded which means warrants should start affecting 3Q and 4Q
results. To what extent does the 2012 guidance reflect this? And can you help us understand your key assumptions?
Will you pay employees out of profits and assume retroactive authorization? Or does your guidance presume stoppage
of many of your large contracts? And can you touch on which large contracts are most at risk under warrants?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: That's a comprehensive question, Heidi. Good morning. I think the details of your question
highlight many of the specific details that have gone into our requests for additional guidance because there is
considerable uncertainty in understanding exactly how sequestration would be implemented and how, for example,
unobligated balances might be affected, how those unobligated balances might be applied contract line item by contract
line item. Whether or not military personnel accounts will be excluded or included in the total amount to be
sequestered, because that has a fairly significant impact on the percentage reductions. So, I think your question's
front-running a little bit of the detail we have.
I'm sure that our government customers are thinking about their responsibilities under the Anti-Deficiency provisions. I
think they understand that pretty well. And I think the final part of your question was which contracts, particularly the

significant ones, might be most affected. And here again I think the devil lies a little bit in the details of understanding
exactly how the across-the-board reductions, perhaps net of funds flowing from unobligated balances versus new
obligational authorities subject to sequestration will impact our individual contract.
So, of course we have significant portfolio areas, Chris mentioned Missile Defense, Chris mentioned the tactical
aircraft portfolio, our airlift capability, our Space Systems programs, we think some of our classified activity likely will
all be subject to sequester and which programs will absorb what percent of cost reduction is not yet clear to us.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Heidi, I'll jump in on one comment. As Bob said in his opening remarks, we have
contemplated or we are contemplating a continuing resolution in the fourth quarter of this year and I'll say that affects
our businesses areas differently, depending on sort of where they are in the life cycle. The one that's the most impacted
is IS&GS, typically because it's the shortest cycle business that we have. So I would say we're probably being a little
cautious perhaps in the guidance that we're giving, considering the fact that we do believe that continuing resolution is
likely going to happen in that fourth quarter.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone, or...
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Bruce, I just was wondering if we could talk a little bit about cash and maybe start off with
some comments around FAS/CAS and the harmonization of that system? I know that starting back in February, you
were able to begin raising your rates and including FAS/CAS harmonization going forward. I was just wondering how
that process is going? And whether the outlook that you've talked about in the past and the impact that FAS/CAS will
have with you going forward, what that kind of looks like? And then just a – on the cash topic, the use this quarter on
the share repurchase [ph] sort of (21:30) has you pacing below $1 billion that you've talked about targeting for
repurchases, again, can you just give us an update on that as well? Thank you.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, sure, Jason. So, as far as sort of a current status of how FAS/CAS is going and is it
tracking to what we've talked about in the past, I would say, yes, it is. That law I think was signed February 27 of this
year. We've already negotiated, across the corporation, a number of what we called our four pricing rate agreements
that have the effects of cash harmonization included in them. So I'll say that is – that's sort of the business as usual at
this point, right now.
You've seen, as we've all seen the effects of lower interest rates through the first half of this year. They're definitely
lower probably than where we – or at the end of last year. Of course we don't set those rates until the end of this year,
but if we were to set them today, they'd be lower than where we were last year.
Our asset returns, I think, are doing actually fairly comparable to what our expectations were. The one thing I think
that's changed, Jason, that's important to consider, not necessarily this year but in future years is the transportation – or
excuse me, the highway bill that was passed recently, which had a consideration for reducing some of the funding
required by ERISA. And that has the effect of lowering the requirements for our ERISA contributions beginning next
year.
The modeling of that's a little complicated; I won't get into it. But basically, think of a band around sort of a 25-year
average of interest rates and if you're outside that – if your current interest rate or discount rate is outside of that band
and used the 25-year average, we're definitely outside of that band as we go into 2013 and so we'll use that 25-year
average, which is a much higher rate than what we're currently experiencing.
That has the effect of, I think I tried to tip on the call in the first quarter that we had, ERISA required contributions of
more than $2 billion going into next year compared to $1.1 billion this year. That change in the funding – consideration
change, including the highway transportation bill, would lower the required contribution to about the level comparable

to what we're seeing this year. So somewhere in the 1.1-ish range or maybe a little flexibility there because we haven't
quite seen the final rates come out of that yet, so there may be a little bit of play but not much, I would guess.
And so just as we get bigger hits sort of from negative events due to the size of our pension plan, we also get bigger
benefits when there are positive events as well. I'll remind you also that the pension, the reduced pension, brings with it
a reduced tax deduction as well, so you shouldn't think of $1 billion as being a pure cash because there will be less tax
deduction associated with that – $1 billion less.
You also asked about share repurchases and we are a little bit light in the first half of the year. We've made no change
in our commitment to the $1 billion outlook and I won't expect to make a change between now and end of year on that.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Bob, you seem to have taken a sort of leadership role for the industry, and your comments
that you've made publicly about sequestration. I'm wondering what sorts of conversations you've been having with
Congress about potential possible outcomes and timelines? And I'm wondering if you can sense any sort of incremental
change in language or posture recently that you – that's detectable or have we made no progress over the last quarter?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Well, thanks for the question, Carter. I know that many in industry are experiencing exactly
what we are right now, Carter, and that I think is best characterized by a huge amount of uncertainty for a long-cycle
business like ours to be unable to see six months into the future for a pretty dramatic reduction of resources available to
our customers is significant and for us unprecedented. Throughout industry I think that reaction is similar.
I will say the awareness about the more detailed aspects of sequestration, I believe, is growing and has grown. And it's
important to remember that sequestration is not just a reduction in discretionary defense accounts, it's also a reduction
in non-defense discretionary accounts which affect lots of civil government agencies. So, I believe we're hearing more
detailed descriptions from agency heads and leaders in the government about the potential adverse impacts and their
ability to meet their mission responsibilities or fulfill their commitments under sequestration.
For our part, we are trying to model internally, but to be very candid with you that model is filled much more with our
assumptions about what might happen than any detail specifically given to us about what will happen. The facts are
sequestration is the law. It goes into effect January the 2nd. It requires $55 billion in each of defense and
non-discretionary – non-defense discretionary accounts. Beyond that we're still struggling with exactly how this will
impact our business.
We are very concerned about the supply chain, particularly small, disadvantaged, minority-owned businesses, what we
regard as the edge of that supply chain. I know we're having discussions here about what kind of business we'll have if
we are compelled to implement sequestration. I think they're asking if they'll even have a business, will they have an
enterprise.
So, I think there significant shocks to the industrial base and very honestly, we've simply tried to describe them to our
best, professional capacity; not to incite any particular level of over concern, but we are very, very concerned about the
across-the-board nature with an automatic trigger, and that's what we've tried to voice.

<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Good morning, Rich.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Just a question on book-to-bill, so it was about 0.9 times, a bit less than the 1 times but still
an improvement versus first quarter. I just wanted to gauge the confidence in finishing the year with book-to-bill of
about 1 times. Maybe highlight some of the contracts you're expecting to book in the second half? Now also, did I hear
you say that you thought South Korea would be booked by yearend? And is that one of the things that's giving you the
confidence?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rich, this is Bruce. I'll take that one on. Your assessment of where we are in the second
quarter relative to orders is correct. And I'll say probably what's not apparent in the absolute numbers recorded is we
are actually ahead of where we thought we'd be at the second quarter this time. I tried to tee up on the first call that we
thought that the second quarter would be down a little lower than normal. The results might lead you to believe that
that's the case, but that's actually a little bit better than we expected it to be. We also mentioned that we thought the
third quarter would be a higher rebound than we historically have in year's past. And we still think that'll be the case.
You asked about some of the – what are the contracts we're looking for. Most of them, frankly, are in the category of
what I would call a follow-on contracts or contracts to be left with the new fiscal year. So the ones I'm watching to
close between now and the end of this year are the F-35 LRIP 5 contract, getting additional funding in the form of
undefinitized contractual action or other means on the LRIP 6 contract. We'd like to close the [ph] FADs (30:06), the
combined buy of [ph] FAD (30:07) missiles for both the U.S. Government as well as the UAE. And we've got a whole
slew of new fiscal year contracts that usually pop up in the fourth quarter. Think of that as the fleet ballistic missile and
the PAC-3 contracts that'll play there. I think – was there a second part of the question there?
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Yeah, Rich, this is Chris. I had mentioned South Korea is a competition for the F-35.
We were told the down select would be at the end of the year, but the actual contract would be in the latter part of 2013
at the earliest. So that would not be in our orders of backlog in 2012.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: And Rich, I don't think I answered just kind of the last part of your question, which was
what's the confidence level we have for sort of ending the year at a 1.0? I still think as we sit here today even with all
the caveats that we did relative to sequestration and so forth we've got a fairly good chance of achieving the same level
of backlog at the end of this year as we started the beginning of this year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to dive a little bit into some of the details on the
F-35 contract profit accrual rates. And so Bruce, you gave a good description of what's going on with SDD. Just want
to confirm that essentially what you're assuming now is that your future fees will be about 4% of future revenues
because you're pretty much at a crossroad point right now where that's true looking backward. And then more
importantly, over on the LRIP side which contracts drove the $20 million risk retirement? And where do we stand
specifically on LRIP 5?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Thanks, Joe, for the question. I think you had assessed pretty right. The change that
we've talked about, I think it's important to note and obviously you understand that very clearly, this is only affecting
the development contract. The production programs are unaffected by that. The production programs typically don't
have much, if any, award fee. They're typically kind of cost performance driven. And so that's I'll say different than the
rate – or the change that we talked about for the F-35 SDD contract.
I made the comment that we were booking higher than 4%; it's a little bit higher than 4% going into this quarter. We
came out a little lower than 4%. And that's the adjustment. That does bring our booked profit down, if you will, below
the amount of earned fees that we have at this point in time. The two programs on the production side where we had

some performance improvements, so our booking rate increases this quarter for both Lot 3 and Lot 5.
I think as we progressed throughout the year I think I made the comment either last quarter or the quarter before about
the number of deliveries, and Chris highlighted that as well in his prepared remarks. We're going to finalize deliveries
of all the LRIP 2 aircraft, all the LRIP 3 and a pretty good portion of LRIP 4 aircraft this year. So typically, as with
most production programs, that'll give you the – or give us, excuse me, the opportunity to assess our performance on
that and see if it's coming in line with our expectations and enables additional risk retirements. I think that there's one
other part of your question there, Joe. I've lost track of what it is to be honest with you, so I'll go on to the next caller.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, Doug.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I wanted to get your thoughts on cost reduction. It's something that you've emphasized
quite a bit over the last six to nine months. Can you talk about what you're doing in that area, whether it's overhead
reduction, supply chain, facilities? And are there certain targets you have and certain progress against those? In other
words, is there any way to quantify the kinds of actions you're taking?
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Yeah, Doug, this is Chris. Thanks for the question. We've been focused on the
affordability for the last several years. I mean it really is all encompassing. We start with the employees and the
leadership team. If you go back a little over a year ago, we had our Voluntary Executive Separation Program where
26% of the leadership team was reduced. And that was over 600 people. Of course there's the slowdown impact of that.
We're looking at the layers. We're looking at the span of control as it relates to the personnel and the organizational
structure. And we're continuing to look at how best to – how best to organize. And you will recall a couple years ago
we exited the Eagan, Minnesota facility. We consolidated Owego into MS2. All those things are on the table.
We've focused quite a bit on facilities and our actual footprint, we've taken out over 1.5 million square feet of our
facilities, both owned and leased. We have another 2.9 million square feet to go that we've identified. And obviously if
there are further cuts to the budget there could be significantly more reductions. And the supply chain you mentioned
clearly that's an area that we focused both internally with category management as we call it, consolidating our
suppliers and holding them – holding them accountable for the quality and timely delivery.
So, I see some of these as being shorter term, some midterm and then of course we're always looking out on the long
term. And back in 2006 we replaced our defined benefit pension plan with defined contribution pension plan. And that
will, I think, position us well for the long term. So that's just kind of an overview of what we're doing. I think when I
last looked you can easily calculate several billion dollars of reduction that we've benefited from. And then we passed
on to our customers as a result of these actions.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question I guess either Bob or Chris. Really wanted
to focus on information systems and – or IS&GS. Just regarding – we've seen the most erosion there in terms of the
backlog. And I get it regarding being impacted by the CR. But I guess following up on Doug's question in terms of
your ability to reduce costs and preserve margins there, you've done a nice job at 9%. But we're still seeing that's the
only segment that's not growing. Can you give us a little more color on that? We're hearing about a lot of predatory
practices amongst your peers in terms of bidding contracts pretty aggressively about preserving those margins. Thanks.

<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Yeah, Peter, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. I guess we were very satisfied with
our margins in IS&GS this quarter. And we seem to have been able to maintain at or around 9%. Relative to top line
growth, you're right, we are experiencing some decline there. It's not unexpected for the reasons that both Bob and
Bruce mentioned and you suggested in your question. We will continue to bid what we think are appropriate business
cases for our business. And I must say we've been very successful on winning some significant opportunities of late
and the protesting is continuing probably more so than the predatory bidding practices.
So I think we have three major wins currently under review that we had previously won. So our strategy is to win all
the business we can at the appropriate returns. We'll let the 100-day protest cycle run out, and then we will move
forward. So I have very high confidence in our ability to execute on these programs. We're hitting all of our milestones.
But as I look forward to additional growth opportunity we're really focused on cyber security. And I mentioned that we
won the – what was referred to as the DC3 contract. That was the largest Department of Defense cyber contract
awarded to date. We have numerous engagements with Fortune 100 corporations. And we're also continuing to look in
healthcare, IT and the energy lines of business as additional growth areas. So I think we have a good strategy. We're
executing on it. And I'm optimistic that we'll find a way to grow over the long haul.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: I guess this is probably a question for Bruce. You obviously benefited from a significant
amount of positive contract adjustments in the quarter. Could you talk about what the guidance for the year assumes for
positive adjustment? And which business areas have the biggest opportunity for positive adjustments moving forward?
Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes. Thanks, David. I think I said at the start – I lose track which quarter I made these
comments on – but I think I'd said in the first quarter that we were looking at 2012 to have maybe comparable levels of
performance improvements as what we saw in 2011. And we actually saw a pretty big increase in those performance
improvements, mostly coming in Electronic Systems in the first quarter. In the second quarter we had some good
performance both particularly in Aeronautics and Electronic Systems also Space Systems on the Orion program as well
as the contractual resolutions that we mentioned. That also caused us to come in higher than what we started at the
beginning of the year or expected at the beginning of the year.
Our expectations for the second half of the year are probably to be down a little bit compared to the second half of
2011. But again, as we get into the quarter and we actually do our assessments of where we stand on program
performance, that's when we would have unexpected both performance improvements as well as potential reductions in
profit rates. But from a planning perspective, as we sit here today, we expect it to be a little lighter in the second half of
the year compared to 2011 and by definition, lighter in the second half this year compared to the first half of this year.

<Q - Robert Stallard>: Bruce, just a quick follow-up on the pension. I think previously you'd said you'd expected the
FAS/CAS charge next year to be roughly half of what you're booking this year. Has that situation changed given the
moving metrics of contributions, interest rates and the new legislation on ERISA contributions?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. We're probably about six months before I'd like to have this conversation, Rob, but
definitely, as I said earlier, interest rates are down. If I was to put a number on them, they're probably down about 75
basis points on a year-to-date basis. Your guess is probably better than mine at this point as to what they will have or
what they will do between now and the end of the year.
You're right on the quantification given in the past. All that assumes, as I like to call it, sort of current course and speed
with the same level of discount rate as we ended last year and 8% return on assets. Again, as I mentioned in earlier
remarks, I think our asset returns are actually holding pretty steady to that level but the discount rate, if we were to pick
it today, would be lower than what it was at the end of the year. That would have a tendency to increase FAS, which
would make a smaller drop – I still believe it'd be a drop – at this point from the FAS/CAS adjustment from 2012 to
2013; that'd be a lesser drop.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yeah. Good morning. Bruce, if I take a look at the guidance you have for the second half of
the year, you're assuming maybe a flattish revenues with the first half and a 10.9% or so margin. I guess that's
consistent with David's question about what's embedded in the second half of the year for ECA, but my question is that
if you go back to last year and your prior years, it's highly unusual for the second half to have a much lower margin
than the first half and yet that's what's being projected. So is there something else that's in there besides the comment
about assuming no incremental ECA's?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: George, let me try to address a couple things I think embedded in your question. One is just
the second half versus the first half in general and then I'll hit on the margins especially. Yeah, I've taken a look at
where we sit today and what our expectations are relative to the guidance we've provided for the second half versus
where we sit today. There's a couple of things that happened in the first half of the year that won't repeat from a
revenue side in the second half of the year, the first of those is again, we had two commercial satellites in the first half
of the year and we're expecting no commercial satellites in the second half. Think of that as probably a little less than
$300 million or so that won't be repeated.
Within Electronic Systems, all 29 of the Persistent Threat Detection System or PTDS systems that were under contract
actually delivered in the first half, so that contract is essentially finished. There will be no PTDS deliveries in the
second half. Think of that also as in the $300 million range, so there's sort of $600 million of pressure going from the
first half to the second half of the year. We also have in the second half probably 9 to 10 fewer F-16 deliveries, second
half of the year again versus first half. But that's probably offset, in large part maybe even more so, because we expect
to have four to five more C-5 deliveries in the second half than the one we've had in the first half, so those kind of push
probably.
I think as I look at the year, it's easier to understand if you sort of do a sequential quarter-to-quarter; it's easier to
understand that. So we did roughly $23 billion of revenue in the first half. And I think if you just went to the midpoint
in the guidance, it's $45.5 billion. So you can say if you just double the $23 billion, we're pretty close to the $45.5
billion but for those two items I mentioned previously. I think the issue is that the comparison with the second half for
2011 is a tough comparison. Both the third and fourth quarter of last year were much higher than the first and second
quarter of last year. And just for example, we did $22 billion roughly in the sales in the first half. We did $24.5 billion
roughly in the second half. So obviously we tremendously outperformed the second half relative to the first half,
whereas 2012, as I said before, is going to be a little lighter in the second half. I also said we might be a little bit
conservative as we sit here today with expected continuing resolution in the fourth quarter in the prospects of a
sequestration on January 2, but we'll see if that actually changes and we'll update accordingly.

Relative to margins, George, you said we don't have a tendency to have a lower second half than a first half. And I'll
say that's – we'll still try to make that come true, but we've had, again, just taking a look at the increased profit rate
adjustments as well as the contractual resolutions that we had happen in the first half of the year, our expectations as we
sit here today is that those won't replicate at the same level for the same reason I told David in the second half. And
that's what will drive margins. Again, maybe a little bit conservative on the topside; it would drive some EBIT. But I
don't know that the margins would change all that much for the second half of the year.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, Sam.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Can you talk a little bit just about something around the cash flow which was around the
continuing resolution last year? You certainly moved to build cash levels, and seeing the buyback activity weaken –
and I guess the first piece is are you doing that now? And second piece is, does that have any implications for how we
should be thinking about the dividend decision that the board typically takes in September, where the last few years
we've certainly seen an acceleration from 10% growth to 20% to 30%. How should we be thinking about the appetite
for an increase this year going into potentially sequestration and continuing resolution?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, thanks, Sam. This is Bruce. I'll try that and Chris or Bob can pile on if they want to. I
think as far as cash balances are concerned, we probably are going into the second half of the year with a little higher
cash balance than we might otherwise have expected. And I think we're trying to be mindful of what could happen
under both a continuing resolution as well as a potential CR. And again, our position is we don't want to induce
behaviors that would cause program performance issues, cost growth, if we can avoid those perhaps with some balance
sheet help. And so we're mindful of that. And again, I think we want to have the flexibility in order to accommodate
that.
We don't see – as I said earlier, I don't see us backing off the $1 billion share repurchase. That's still our plan and goal
for the year. Even though we were a little bit lighter in the second quarter, I still think we're going to achieve that $1
billion number. You asked about the dividends in September. We revisit that every year with our Board of Directors.
We've had some preliminary conversations with them. But that's a decision that we'll make in consultation with our
board members and I'd be premature to have that discussion with you right now.

the other thing I was going to ask is really where I think Joe was going before is just the latest on LRIP 5.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: I knew I missed that one. I'll catch that on this one, Rob. And I apologize for Joe. I realize
after I went to the next speaker that I missed that one. So ES second half, again ES, Electronic Systems, is where we

have the PTIDS. Again, we've got about a $300 million headwind because all those units delivered, as I said earlier, in
the first half. I'd like to think, Rob, that we have a chance to do a little better there. That's yet to play out. And we'll
watch that closely. I'll say I've been pleasantly surprised by the performance of Electronic Systems in both the first
quarter and the second quarter.
You know Electronic Systems historically in going into the future is always – has had our highest international content.
I think that there's still some potential international awards this year that could help us with the sales growth in the
second half of the year. But those, as usual, are a little harder to predict at this point in time. So are we conservative? I
hope so, Rob. And we'll see as that plays out to the second half of the year.
[ph] LFI (51:06) negotiations, again I apologize, Joe. We're continuing the process; it is a long process. We've been at it
now for at least a year and a half. So I'll say I think we're making slow and steady progress. I think both sides have a
desire to get this closed and to get this closed in the not too distant future. And we're clearly on that page that we'd like
to do that as well. I think we will close in a manner that's beneficial to both parties in the not too distant future.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: I'll just add on, on the international front and whether these orders get closed this year or
2013. I personally just got back from a two-week trip in Maryland, Houston and all of our execs have been increasing
their international travel to the Far East and the Mid-East. And there is definitely a concern relative to the threat
environment. And I believe our portfolio and the interest they have in our fighter aircraft whether it's the F-35 or the
F-16, the C-130 everybody loves, and of course our missile defense and command and control systems. There is a big
appetite out there based on the portfolio that we have. And I believe we have the experience and the know-how and the
relationships to do business internationally and to grow. And when they hit the books is to be determined, but I can
assure you there's a lot of interest and it's a focus of ours going forward.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you. So Bruce, could you quantify how big were the cum-catch estimate changes
in total in the second quarter, and kind of what are you looking for, for the full year? And then the notional question
that you've been at this 30% more or less level for so long; is that sustainable in 2013 and 2014 in this current
environment?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Cai, I think in the – I'll stick with what we have in the release which says we had
about $160 million, $170 million improvement in our profit rate adjustment this quarter compared to the second quarter
of last year and again several performance improvements that I've elaborated on already across all four business areas.
But maybe just to reiterate C-130 international programs we had, as you might expect because of the end of the PTDS
contract, we recognized some performance improvements on that. We also have nice performance on our Vertical
Launch System, out of Electronic Systems.
We had, as I mentioned earlier, performance improvement because of a risk retirement for a developmental milestone
associated with the Orion crew exploration vehicle. And then on top of that, we had, again I'll say an unusually high
level of contractual resolutions that resolved this quarter. And so that's the one that is making the numbers probably a
little higher than last year's second quarter.
As far as sustainability, you mentioned the 30%. I still think that we're able to maintain that level. If you look back at
our history, Cai, we've done that every year. I mean I look at it again from sort of what is in our planning going forward
in terms of planned risk retirements, planned profit rate increases. And I'll say they approach that level today.
And where we differ from that level is when we have unplanned beneficial improvements above what we already had
considered, or when it goes the other way and we have a negative or a decremented profit rate adjustment. Thankfully
this year we've had few of those. Those were offset again primarily by the contractual resolutions and we were left with
the overall performance improvement. So, you know I still see that trend as what is going to happen the latter half of
this year and going into 2013 and for that matter beyond as well.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks, good morning. ULA, you commented in the release that it would pick up
the contributions into the second half. Bruce, can you talk about what that's going to look like sequentially into the
second half? And also is that a headwind into 2013? And then to squeeze another one in, the pullback in rates, the
disconnect now that exists between CAS and ERISA and FAS, do you think mark-to-market approach on pension
expense is making more sense given all the changes that have happened over the last six months?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thanks, Cai. You've got both ends of the spectrum with your question there. Let me try to
address – oh, sorry, did I say – it's Myles. I'm sorry, I knew it was you, Myles.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: It's okay. I've been called worse.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Sorry about that. So I did try to write some comments in my prepared remarks about ULA
and USA. relative to the equity earnings we're expecting. We had a little lower equity earnings in the second quarter, as
I said, mostly are – because of timing issues. So it was actually a nice performance improvement out of our ULA
operation last quarter that wasn't replicated this quarter which made that comparison year-over-year a little more
difficult. But this quarter had just lower earnings based on the launch vehicles and the like in the second quarter. We do
expect a fairly significantly higher second half of the year relative to the earnings, with most of that coming in the third
quarter.
You didn't mention USA, but we're also expecting sort of with the closeout of the United Space Alliance activity to
have an additional improvement relative to that equity earnings higher than what we've experienced in the first half of
this year. So both of those are going to cause, I'll say, a little spike in the third quarter and then we'll come back down
in the fourth quarter but again, collectively higher in the second half than the first half.
You asked about going forward, and I'll say, we lose that spike relative to the USA going into 2013 and beyond, but
what we're seeing within the Space Systems company, and I've said this on a couple of occasions is, we're getting
finished with a number of developmental parts of programs, such as the MUOS contract, the SBIRS contract and some
others and we're getting into sort of the sweet spot of production vehicles for all of those and we're doing very well on
those. And that performance on the production coming out of the development that as you can expect, the margin
improvements associated with that are helping to mitigate the downward pressure resulting from the lower equity
earnings next year, plus that I don't expect a large change in the margins to occur because of that lower equity amount.
CAS and ERISA and a lot of moving pieces that you describe there in mark-to-market, we have looked at that multiple
times and I'm not sure – this is why I think I keep preaching that you've got to look through the accounting and get to
the economics of it. And I – frankly, I personally favor sort of we all get on the same page there, but I don't know that I
see a change on the horizon for us to get the mark-to-market as a company.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Karen, this is Jerry. I think we're coming up on the hour. Maybe one more question in the
queue?
Operator
Certainly, sir. Our final question for the day comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Oh, thank you very much. Sort of related to what you've talked about in Space and then in
one other thing. In Space, you've made some management reorganizations and you could address what that does also in
terms of taking out costs? And then can you reconcile – Bob, you alluded to it that you've had some great performance
metrics on the F-35 and yet you're not getting, I guess, compensated for it?

<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Okay, Howard, it's Chris. Let me take the Space question. As I mentioned in an
earlier answer, we are constantly looking at our organizational structure and looking how best to streamline and
consolidate and get synergies both from a revenue and a cost side. What we basically did there was flattened the
organization and I think we went from about seven or eight lines of business directly reporting into our EVP to four or
five. The goal there was to reduce the overhead in the infrastructure to support the businesses and we also pointed a
Deputy, Rick Ambrose, long time executive with the corporation to help Joanne as we focus on the strategy and the
execution. So the overall goal there was better alignment with the customer and cost savings and I guess I'll turn it over
to Bob here for the F-35 and the wrap-up.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah, thanks, Chris. And Howard, thanks for the questions. So relative to the F-35 and our
earning potential, we all recognized and you all recognized this is a complex demanding program, really a one of a kind
type program that is unfolding in an increasingly tough environment. So we're held to very high standards and we
expect to be held to high standards. We look back at the 18 – last 18 months performance and found it to be good.
We're ahead of our planning. I think we're meeting our marks. There is much more to go. So we're very realistic about
the overall performance.
Bruce's comments about the system design and development phase, I think, reflect the reality that we're looking at. But
increasingly, our earnings potential will be defined by our ability to produce and deliver the production aircraft lot over
lot. And we're very focused on achieving that goal because that's what's going to give our customers the fore structure
and the capacity that they need that they expect from us. So all of us are very focused on the entire F-35 program;
we've tried to give the best balance assessment and accounting of how we expect to earn profit. I will tell you we do
expect to earn profit. We think, when we deliver high-quality products, that is an appropriate economic response so that
we can share in the value of that performance with the investors in the company.
Robert J. Stevens
So for all of us, we thank you for your time on the call today. We appreciate the questions; thought they were
challenging and good and really insightful about our business. I'll tell you, we're all very pleased that the company has
remained strong and focused in a really challenging environment. We think that's great credit to the women and men
who work here. They exhibit great dedication on a daily basis and we're grateful to them.
We have a really strong portfolio. Chris mentioned his international travel along with our other executives where we
believe we're well-aligned with both global and domestic defense and security priorities. Our backlog, our cash
resources, the financial strength of our company provide, we think, a degree of certainty in an uncertain environment as
we look to deliver increasing value to shareholders and to customers. And we'll stay very focused on high levels of
discipline. And as Bruce said, we'll update you as soon as we possibly can as to these changes in our environment and
what they might mean to us.
So, Karen, thank you for your help on the call today. Thank you all for participating. And we'll sign off here.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the
program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.
