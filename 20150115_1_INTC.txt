So with that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich
Thanks, Mark. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a great year. We began 2014 expecting roughly flat
year-over-year revenue and operating income. Instead, the company's full year revenue grew 6%, setting an all-time
record of $55.9 million. At the same time, operating income rose 25%.
When I became CEO, I set two imperatives for the company. First, develop a more outside-in view of markets to
ensure we go to where the markets are headed. And second, increase our velocity or pace of innovation in a purposeful
direction. Over the last year, we've made meaningful progress against these imperatives, which helped us meet and
exceed many of our top goals. I'd like to take a moment to review the year.
In the PC Client group, our goal was to stabilize the PC business. We expected revenue to be down by a low-single
digit percentage and for operating profit to be roughly flat year-over-year. Instead, the year closed with a 4% increase
in revenue and a 25% increase in operating profit. Our focus on Reinventing the Computing Experience and leaving no
segment un-served, from the low end to the high end, contributed to these results.
We launched Broadwell on the world's first 14-nanometer manufacturing process. While we did have some startup
challenges that contributed to roughly six months' delay, yields have steadily improved. The end result is a family of
Core M and fifth-generation core processors that are the foundation for the industry's most compelling new designs.
These designs include the finished, lightest, the most energy efficient notebooks, 2-in-1s, Ultrabooks, Chromebooks,
and mini PCs.
We began the year with high expectations with the Data Center Group. We said that we would capitalize on the growth
of the Cloud and Big Data by diversifying customer segments and product leadership. We initially forecasted revenue
growth in the low to mid-teens and operating profit growing faster than revenue. We exceeded those high expectations
and grew revenue 18%, while operating profit expanded by a remarkable 31%.
In the Mobile and Communications Group, we set a goal to ship into 40 million tablets in 2014. This goal was intended
to establish Intel architecture in the marketplace and scale the supply chain and attract developers. I'm pleased to report
that we shipped into 46 million tablets, becoming one of the industry's largest merchant silicon providers in tablets. We
also begin shipping our second-generation LTE baseband known as 7260.
We're proud that the company reached these milestones, but we have more work ahead of us. A key goal for mobility is
to improve profitability. To that end, we just qualified the first SoC in our SoFIA lineup. SoFIA is a low-cost integrated
applications processor and baseband chip. As it ramps, it will progressively reduce the build material costs that have
adversely affected our gross margins in the Mobile business. We also struck landmark agreements with Rockchip and
Spreadtrum to expand the development and distribution of IA product [indiscernible] (05:17).
Similarly, we grew other adjacent businesses by using IP from our core products. For example, our Internet of Things
Group grew 19% in 2014, passing the $2 billion mark for the first time. The recently launched RealSense 3D Camera
technology is another example of extending our IP. RealSense is redefining imaging in a variety of competing devices.
It's also making its way into all sorts of new and unanticipated applications, highlighting the value of taking an outside
in-view, investing ahead of trends, and shaping nascent technology. Finally, you see us moving quickly into Wearables
through our growing portfolio of collaborations with world-class fashion and fitness reps like Fossil, Oakley, Opening
Ceremony, and SMS Audio. Along with our own products like the Basis Peak and Curie module, our computer is the
size of a button.
Intel is in a very different place today than we were just 12 months ago. We are participating in a broader range of
devices, and we are innovating in emerging segments. These are the trends we will build on in 2015, bringing us closer
to our vision that if it's smart and connected, it is best with Intel. Our work isn't done, but our progress against our
imperatives leaves us increasingly confident in our strategy.

With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Brian.
To reiterate what Brian said, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a great year. Revenue of $14.7 billion was a
record for the company and was up 6% from the prior year. The strength of our product portfolio can be seen in our
gross margin of over 65% and in our profitability. Operating income grew 25% and earnings per share, which also
benefited from the passage of the R&D tax credit, grew 45% from a year ago.
From a market perspective, we saw nice unit and revenue growth in the PC Client Group segment with revenue up 3%
and operating profit up 18% on a year-over-year basis. The Data Center Group benefited from the build-out of the
Cloud, Data Analytics, and our strong product portfolio. This business achieved 25% revenue growth and 39% profit
growth year-over-year. The company saw a modest increase in net inventory levels quarter-over-quarter as we are
efficiently managing capacity while ramping Broadwell on 14-nanometer. And the worldwide PC supply chain appears
to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate as we enter the first quarter. These results for the fourth quarter
completed a strong year for Intel.
Recapping the 2014 financials. For full year 2014, revenue of $55.9 billion was up 6%, operating income of $15.3
billion was up 25%, and earnings per share of $2.31 was up 22% from 2013. Gross margin of approximately 64% in
2014 is up about four points from 2013. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $19.7 billion in 2014, up $1 billion from
2013, driven primarily by increased R&D spending and higher profit dependent spending.
In 2014, both our PC business and our Data Center business outperformed our expectations at the start of the year. PC
Client Group revenue grew by 4%. We saw PC Client Group platform volumes grow 8% from a year ago and inclusive
of tablets, we saw 18% unit growth. Operating profit for the PC Client Group segment was up 25% over the same
horizon.
We saw robust growth in our Data Center business with 8% unit growth leading to 18% revenue growth from 2013 and
operating profit growth of 31%. Additionally, in comparison to 2013, the Internet of Things segment achieved revenue
growth of 19%, the software and services operating segment was up slightly, our NAND business grew at a fast pace,
and although revenue was down for the Mobile and Communications Group, we grew share in tablets.
The business continued to generate significant cash with $20.4 billion of cash from operations in 2014. Total cash
balances at the end of the year was roughly $14.1 billion, down approximately $6 billion from a year ago. We
purchased $10.1 billion in capital assets, down from our prior outlook of $11 billion as we found efficiencies,
optimized the manufacturing network, and increased our factory utilization.
In addition, we paid $4.4 billion in dividends. In November, we announced a dividend increase to $0.96 per share on an
annual basis effective for the first quarter of 2015. We repurchased about $10.8 billion of stock in 2014, up from $2.1
billion in 2013.
Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, is approximately $340 million and inclusive of our other longer term
investments is more than $4 billion. This is down by over $5.5 billion from the start of the year.
As we look forward to the first quarter 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range to $13.7 billion plus
or minus $500 million, down about 7% from the fourth quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal
decline for the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be 60%
plus or minus a couple of points.
Consistent with the business drivers discussed in the November investor meeting, the five point decline from the fourth
quarter is primarily driven by higher platform unit costs on 14 nanometer products, higher factory start-up costs and
lower platform volumes.

Turning to full year 2015, we are planning for revenues to grow in the mid-single digits. We are forecasting the
midpoint of our gross margin range at 62% plus or minus a couple of points. We are forecasting R&D and MG&A
spending for the year at $20 billion plus or minus $400 million, and we are forecasting capital spending of $10 billion
plus or minus $500 million.
2014 was a great year, and the financials demonstrate our strategy in action as we enter 2015. First, we are growing
again across a broad range of products and markets. Second, we continue to invest in our core competitive advantages
of leadership IP and leadership manufacturing. These competitive advantages are becoming increasingly valuable and
increasingly rare. Third, we are in a great position to benefit from the build-out of the Cloud and Data Analytics as we
enter 2015, and we expect these trends to drive growth again this year. And last, we continue to execute to our strategy
of both investing in our business and also generating return for our shareholders via the dividend and the buyback.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Okay, thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to
ask one question and just one follow-up, if they have one. Jamie, please introduce our first questioner.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Danely from Citigroup.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Thanks, guys. Brian, in all sincerity, congratulations on a great year for yourself and
the company. I guess the first question is on gross margins. Can you just talk about – I guess it's for Stacy – the trend in
gross margins after Q1? And embedded in that, do you think that the second half 2015 gross margins can be equal to
the second half of 2014 gross margins? And for this year, assuming something close to normal, can we assume gross
margins would be up in 2016 on an apples-to-apples basis?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Hi, Chris. This is Stacy. Yeah, I'll just start this by saying I'm not going to forecast 2016 gross
margins in January of 2015. We'll probably talk about those in November, so you're getting a little ahead of me. In
terms of the – what's happening in the gross margin, it's very consistent with what we talked about in the November
Investor Meeting. And to specifically answer your question, yes, I expect that the second half gross margins will be
back above the midpoint we forecasted, 62% for the year. We're at 60% in Q1. I think the second half will be above
that midpoint; the first half will be below. This is all what I told you in November.
The big drivers for us here are 14-nanometer, as 14-nanometer becomes a larger mix of our products, we're mixing up
in terms of our costs. That is higher than normal in the beginning of the year and then it will come down and catch up
to prior technologies by the time we get into the back half. We have some increase in startup costs, and then we'll get
some good news associated with getting back some of the impact associated with tablets. So we'll get back about half
of the impact from 2014 into 2015. In terms of whether that'll match the back half of 2014, I'd say the only thing that I'd
point to is 2015 is a year where we have startup costs, so that's going to be an overhang through the year and you know
our cadence is kind of every other year. So probably adjusted for that, we're going to be in the same kind of range.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Great. And then for my follow-up, a question for Brian, just on the MCG business.
So Brian, I guess we're still losing a little more than $1 billion a quarter, but you said that those losses will go down.
Any color you can provide on that? Anything you can give us in terms of your overall goals or goals for the mobile
business this year either in units or profitability or anything else there?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. Sure, Chris. So what we said for 2015, so if you remember, step back, in 2014, we
said, look, we have to go out and establish a footprint here. We have to get ourselves known in this market, be

considered a serious player and get the developers attracted both the hardware and software developers interested in IA.
And so that's – we went out to set a goal, a unit-level goal, so you knew we were serious. And we bought parts that
were not necessarily designed for this segment and that's where the BOM cost deltas came from.
For 2015, we feel like we've done a very nice job now of establishing ourselves. We're one of the top producers of
silicon in this segment. And our goal right now is, from a unit perspective, is we think we can just grow roughly at what
the market will grow for tablets. So we don't need to go out and necessarily outpace the market or anything like that,
for this year, from a growth perspective. Instead, we're going to focus on two segments, and that is, one, as you just
said, getting our cost profiles down, making it so that we're much more cost-effective and as a result getting the loss
out. Stacy and I committed to drive $800 million out of this business for 2015.
We believe we have a solid plan to go do that. That's based on a couple of things. One, part of this reorganization was
to drive efficiency to get the consistency across the platform to be utilized and to get the efficiency of people, of
hardware, of software, of all of that done. The other one is, as we move into the second half of this year especially,
SoFIA, which we said was designed for this segment and has no BOM outer or difference; it really starts to ramp. And
you saw we've already internally qualified our first SoFIA, the 3G version. We said that the next version, the LTE
version would be in the first half of next year and will ramp through the year. So as those come in, they take a lot of
that cost delta out. And that's – we are feeling fairly very good about the $800 million.
The other place you saw, the Dell Venue 87000, is a great example. It won Best of Innovation at CES and Best of Show
at CES and it's showing the thinnest tablet with real innovation at a $399 price where people can start to make money
in the tablet space a little bit now again. And so we think the combination of the right products plus real innovation like
that will allow us to make real progress.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Mike McConnell from Pacific Crest Securities.
<Q - Michael C. McConnell>: Thank you. Looking at the balance sheet, Stacy, there was a pretty significant spike in
receivables in Q4, and DSOs look like they're pretty elevated relative to levels we've seen in the last couple of years.
Could you kind of explain what was going on there with the receivables?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure. And actually, I think DSOs still are in a healthy range. But the timing, the quarter was a
little bit more back-end loaded than Q3 was, and so we ended the quarter with more receivables. It was as simple as
that. We started with – we didn't have a terribly strong October and the quarter strengthened as we went through.
<Q - Michael C. McConnell>: Okay. Great. And then just looking at linearity for DCG, given you've got a new
product family, we've got an operating system from Microsoft that's going to be expiring this year. Could you give us
any color on how we should expect linearity on a quarterly basis for DCG this year if it will be any different than what
we've seen in the past?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So yeah, I think we always caution you, it's – the PC market, I think we have data that says it
behaves roughly seasonal. With DCG, you have to be careful because you have five to 10 very large Cloud customers
that based on their buying patterns can really change the quarter-to-quarter trend. So I tend to hesitate to tie too much to
seasonal in DCG. When you look at the results over the course of 2014, there's robust unit growth, there was great
revenue growth, 18% revenue growth. And as we said in the Investor Meeting, we think that the underlying trends that
are driving that continue into 2015 and we put a forecast out there that said in excess of 15% growth. That's what we
still think.

The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Hi. Thank you. Brian, I just wanted to continue with the question on the mobility side.
Based on the drivers that you laid out, should we then expect that the recovery in the operating losses should be more
back-end loaded? And then you mentioned that tablets you expect to grow with the end market. And most, and at least
I'll speak for myself, we expect almost no growth. So is that how you guys are thinking about the tablet market? And
then I had a quick follow-up for you, Stacy.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure, so let me give you the – how we view the market, and then I'll let Stacy talk about
how the $800 million is laid out through the year, and then you can talk about the margins, too.
I've seen forecasts that are at or near zero, as you say. I've seen forecasts that are a slight decline, I've seen forecasts
that have, say, 10% to low-teen growth in tablets, and it's kind of varied as the fourth quarter went through even. So
that's why we've kind of said, we'll grow at the rate that the market does. I don't think I want to necessarily shrink, so
unless the market shrinks significantly, I think we would then probably try and target more of a flattish. But in general,
I think saying that we're going to grow our market tells you I'm not try and outgrow the market is the message I'm
trying to send. And whether it's minus 5%, zero, plus 5% to 10%, I call all of that, kind of flattish to growth with the
market.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. And on the linearity of the $800 million improvement, there's really at the highest level,
three things that are improving our profitability this year. So first is bringing SoFIA into the product mix. That helps us
both from the standpoint of the SoC cost that SoFIA has and the contra revenue dollars associated with Bill of Material
offset that we've been providing, which we don't plan to provide with SoFIA. That is back-end loaded. We're bringing
SoFIA into the product family kind of as we speak, but it becomes really significant volume for us when we get into the
back half.
The second one is the ramp of LTE to offset some of the investments we've been making there. That ramp is underway
now, but I would expect the back half volume to be higher than the first half. So that also is little bit more back-end
loaded. And then the third is, as we've said, we're shifting the investment profile and that's more linear across the year.
So those are the three items, and two of those three does put more of the improvement in the back half.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Okay. Thank you. And my quick follow-up for you, Stacy, is on the capital allocation
side. Last couple of quarters, you did a great job, bought back a lot of stock. But now if I look at the onshore versus
offshore on the balance sheet, there's just a $2 billion delta. Could you remind us, in terms of the cash flow generated,
how much is onshore versus offshore? And then the ramifications for stock buyback? Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure. It varies year by year depending on where we're – remember, we actually invest in
factories around the world. So a lot of the onshore versus offshore will vary based on where we're starting up factories.
But the majority of our cash generation is in the U.S. We do generate a lot of cash, and we certainly have the ability to
use that for any corporate purposes, including a buyback.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Thanks, Ambrish.
Operator
The next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Great, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. First question, Stacy, I see the CapEx
is shifting around a little bit. Anything significant there? Or were you just able to find a little bit of ability to save some
money?

<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I would term it as a fairly significant reduction in CapEx for 2014, and we brought down,
we brought the CapEx for 2015 down to the bottom of the range.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Yeah.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And it's a variety of things. When I look at the savings we had in 2014, about half of it was due
to, call it, basic blocking and tackling; we were able to negotiate some lower pricing. We had some non-capacity
related projects that we were able to push out of the year and we're always looking for those opportunities, and I think
the manufacturing organization did a great job of finding them. And then about half of it is, as we progressed over the
course of 2014, we learned a couple of things. One is our confidence in yields and our yield forecast went up. That's
what we showed you in the November Investor Meeting. Secondly, the manufacturing organization demonstrated the
ability to start-up factories more quickly than we had assumed at the beginning of the year, and the combination that
allowed us to shift out the third HVM, 14-nanometer factory that starts up, now kind of mid-2015, out by two to three
months. And that doesn't sound like a lot, but given how capital-intensive those factories are, that actually gives us a
much more capital efficient ramp and we're able to generate some savings as a result of it.
<Q - James V. Covello>: That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You're welcome.
<Q - James V. Covello>: And as a follow-up, Brian, I mean, could you just on the highest level maybe give us a sense
of how you think the PC market stands today entering 2015 compared to how it was entering 2014? Some of the ODM
data would suggest we exited 2014 a little weaker, but that may just be a function of that weak October that Stacy had
mentioned in terms of the linearity and things. Maybe it really is more similar than we thought, even though the
quarterly data isn't quite as good in 2014 as it was 2013. But maybe if you could offer your perspective there? Thank
you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah, so I'm not sure of all of your statistics you just threw out there, Jim. But let me just
give you kind of our view of the PC market. I think when we look at Q4, and then again, as you look at 2014 overall, it
was a very strong, it played out exactly as we forecasted and had predicted, and Q4 ended up being very much a
seasonal quarter. We saw demand in the more mature markets stronger, especially on the consumer side than in the
emerging markets. And as Stacy mentioned, our inventories as we exit Q4, we're very comfortable with where the
inventories are. So remember, as we exited Q3 and kind of entered Q4, there might've been – there was some concern
there might have been a little inventory. We feel like we've burned that off through the system, especially a lot of that
was down at the lower end. And as we execute forward, we're very comfortable with the inventory.
For me, as I look out into now 2015, I look at it and say, okay, we've got Core M, which has just really hit the market
as we entered into the holiday season. We saw great thin fanless 2-in-1 devices at all price points that I believe will
stimulate usage there. We've got the Broadwell-U, which is the first of the really high volume Broadwell just hitting the
market. We've got something – a dozen systems in Q1 that will be coming out on Broadwell. You saw us introduce
RealSense at CES. We have I think seven or eight systems in the first quarter coming out with RealSense and that
combination.
So I look at the amount of innovation, all of the OSs we're on and availability and really optionality a consumer has for
OS or an enterprise, and the price points. You've got PCs from Chromebooks down in the $199, Windows Systems
$249, all the way up from there to the real innovative systems like Sprout. I look at it and say that the innovation and
the options of the PC market have never been better.
So I'm feeling pretty good about where we are in the PC market. If you'll remember, our forecast is based even still on
flat units and a slight decrease in ASP. So we're still, even though I've told you there's all this innovation and there's
that, we still have been relatively conservative and said it's a flat unit year and a slight decline even in ASPs given that.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And if I could just emphasize one point on Q4, I think we've characterized it as pretty normal
from an in-demand standpoint. We under-shipped demand some in Q4 so there was an inventory burn. And what we
now think happened as we look back is there was a bit of inventory, particularly Bay Trail lower end systems. When

we started the quarter that led to some weakness in the first few weeks and then it caught back up as we worked our
way through the quarter and burned through that inventory. And then we saw it behave a bit more normally from a
shipment pattern.

The next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Thanks very much. You talked about blocking and tackling to bring down CapEx but your
$10 billion 2014 CapEx and then your 2015 plan is almost $1 billion below $10.7 billion to $11 billion in every year
2011 to 2013. So are you actually on a permanently higher level of capital efficiency? And if that's the case, what
would your long-term CapEx as a percent of revenue be?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: No. I'll say, David, the fact that we were at $10 billion in 2014 and we're at $10 billion in 2015
doesn't change my long-term view. If you think about what I showed in the investor meeting, I showed that we're kind
of in between $10 billion and $11 billion. We're at the low-end of that for a couple of years. I still think that's the right
range for us. Within that, two-thirds to three-quarters is manufacturing capacity related, and then the rest is
non-manufacturing CapEx.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay. Great. And when do you expect to offer 10-nanometer capability to foundry customers?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: We are timing on 10-nanometers. I'm not going to come out with when we'll be introducing
our 10-nanometer to the marketplace in general, probably until the end of this year. So again, as we go through the
year, probably by the investor meeting in November, we'll give you an outlook on how and what timing is for 10
nanometers.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Thanks very much.
Operator
The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I think first I just want to – it sounds like the
slightly weaker PC volume you saw in Q4 is not changing your 2015 in the market at all. If the inventory burn that you
saw in the channel was at the low-end, we saw ASPs come up I guess because you were losing some of that low-end
shipment. What does that suggest for your ASP trend next quarter as potentially those – I guess I should ask do you see
those inventory trends going back the other way? And what does that mean for pricing as we move into next quarter?
Does the low-end start to come back for you?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. So I'll take that. So first off, I'll say the ASP good news that we saw in Q4 really had
three elements to it. One element was the fact that we saw some inventory burn on Bay Trail, so our mix within
notebooks was a little bit higher. Think of that in rough numbers, that's about a third of it. And about two-thirds of it is
associated with server. We just had a very strong quarter in terms of Server, and our Server mix is starting to look
better, starting to improve some. So that's about two-thirds of it.
In terms of the impact on Q1, it's not jumping out on the margin recon, so you should take from that, that we're
expecting pretty benign ASP environment as we go into the year, and it also doesn't pop out on the year recon, so it's
not a big driver of gross margin next year based on what we can see today.

<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. And so my follow-up, I want to ask maybe a more general question on
14-nanometers versus 22-nanometers. So for 14-nanometers, you've shown a lot of charts, showing normalized cost per
transistor dropping below trend. Obviously, wafer cost is going up quite a bit but your density seems to be increasing
even faster, and that's going down, but that's a normalized basis. At the same time, we've had yields that have obviously
taken a bit longer to get into place. We have factory ramps that seem to be hitting more than normal in the first half of
the year. Would you say that the all-in costs of the lifetime of 14-nanometer is actually going to turn out to be lower
than the all-in costs of 22-nanometer?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Hey. It's Stacy. I would take you back to the graph I showed at the Investor meeting, because I
actually – a non-normalized cost that showed Broadwell relative to other products at the same stage of manufacturing.
And so what that chart shows is that sure enough, in the first half of this year, so the early stage of the Broadwell ramp,
because of some of the yield issues that we've talked about, it is higher. On a non-normalized basis, it's a higher cost.
But by the time we get into the back half of the year, on a non-normalized basis, Broadwell actually is less expensive
than those other products at the same stage of their life.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: So do you think if I integrate that curve over the lifetime, the integral will be lower?
<A - Mark Henninger>: Hey, Stacy. We'll go ahead and answer that question, but I just want to remind you, we're
trying to take two questions per person, please.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Sure. Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So honestly, I haven't done a volume-weighted ramping – or a volume-weighted cost
comparison. I've just looked at it in the curves that I showed you. So I guess a lot of it depends on how much volume
happens after we get to that point of parity and improvement. But I think that the cost per transistor and the fact that we
are investing that in lower die sizes and more features, we think we're getting a super high-performance and very
cost-effective product on 14-nanometer. Got it. Thank you, guys.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Stacy.
Operator
The next question comes from Ruben Roy from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Ruben Roy>: Thank you. The first question is for Brian, just around SoFIA and some of the commentary that you
had on expectations for a solid ramp in the second half, just qualified internally I believe. Is the chip qualified on
network? And can you talk about design win traction at this point?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So we have – let me start. There's a series of SoFIA products. There's the SoFIA –
the first of the products is the SoFIA 3G, which is a – it basically has a 3G modem. The second product will be a
SoFIA LTE, LTE modem. What we said was the 3G modem version, the SoFIA 3G, has finished its internal
qualification, which means that we've gone through and made sure that the apps processor is fully functional, the
modem's working. All of that work is done. It's electrically and logically functional.
We are in the process now of what we – and we've got several design wins. And I just never able to go and tell you, but
it's with all of our major OEMs and partners, plus some. We are in the process now of going out to the carriers and
getting the carrier certifications, and that's why we said that actually, that's the difference, the time difference, between
ramping of product or qualifying of the product in Q4 internally and before our customers can ramp in the first half is a
lot of that qualification in getting it out there into the rest of the world. The same thing will happen; we said we would
qualify internally in the first half the LTE with a ramp-up in second half. It's that same process that's going to occur.
<Q - Ruben Roy>: Thank you for that, Brian. Just a quick follow-up for Stacy, on the data center side. A solid year for
ASP growth, and I think over the last few years, you've been averaging kind of a mid- to high single-digit ASP growth.
Can you talk a little bit about the drivers behind that and if you think that's sustainable over the next couple of years?
Thanks.

<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. So I think I've said in the past, I view ASP growth in the data center product line as being
much more akin to capacity additions. So as the performance of the machines go up, as people move up in terms of
one-way servers to two-way servers to four-way servers, what we see that as a increase in ASP, but it really is from the
standpoint of a CIO, an increase in capacity that they go and buy. How sustainable it will be? I don't know. But it is a
segment of the market where as we bring technology in and that technology brings benefit to the customers and
increases their capacity and decreases their operating costs, we get paid for advancing technology faster than others can
do it. I don't know, Brian, if you want to add anything to that.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: No, I think you covered it well.

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
<Q - John William Pitzer>: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Brian, Stacy, nice job on the quarter. My first question,
Stacy, is a follow-up on gross margins. You'd given us Q1 and you've told us that second half is going to be above that
kind of full year guide at 62%. I'm kind of curious, relative to how you see the first half playing out, is Q1 going to be
the trough or do you have more sort of non-operational things like start-up costs in the June quarter that could actually
have gross margins go down again sequentially in June before rebounding in the second half?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I'm not sitting on a bunch of bad news for Q2. So I would expect Q1 to be the trough for
the year.
<Q - John William Pitzer>: That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, Brian, one of the things that happened when
PC penetration slowed was that mix actually got better than I think a lot of us from the outside looking in thought. Do
you think that now the tablet penetration growth seems to be slowing that we could see some stabilization of mix or
even some mix-up perhaps? How do you view the tablet market as unit growth begins to slow relative to mix?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: That's an interesting question, John. I think that almost like the PC, if you really look back
at the PC, the PC began to kind of bifurcate. You did see systems coming in at lower and lower price points, right? And
you saw kind of the bottom of the PC market go from the $500 range to, as we said now, you can go out there and get a
good system, $249 all the way down to $199 with Chrome. I think – and then you saw – but at the same time, as you
said, we saw record Core i7 and the gaming PCs are hitting record levels, and so the high end kind of did very well as
well, and we've been working on filling in that middle.
I think the same thing's going to happen on the tablets. You are going to see a robust low end of the tablets. I go to
Shenzhen, I see what's coming out of China right now, and there are some good low-cost tablets that are going to come
out and continue to drive probably that average ASP of system down into $700 range. At the same time, I think you see
systems that we've got them coming with all of our major OEMs, Lenovo, Dell, HP, systems with real innovation,
things like the RealSense Snapshot, thinner and lighter, longer battery life, better screens, edge-to-edge screens. People
are willing, if you bring the innovation, a $399 tablet, maybe $299 to $399 tablet, is not an unreasonable price if you
bring the performance or capability that's new and innovative. So I think we'll get that same kind of effect, yes, in the
tablet space that we saw in the PC space as well.
<Q - John William Pitzer>: Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Stacy, a couple for you, actually. The first one
is on full year R&D spend. It looks like you're going that in line to slightly even faster than the midpoint on the revenue
side of things. Can you just give us a little bit of detail why the R&D is going to be up about 6% year-over-year,
especially given it's either the tick or the tock year where some of the expense goes up into COGS?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. There's, I'd say, two things to point to. So first of all, we are making increases in R&D
investment in areas where Brian and I have looked and believe we're going to get a significant payoff on those
investments. So specifically, Data Center Group, the Internet of Things group, and a bit more towards process
technology. And they were offsetting some of that with decreases in investment in other areas that you've seen, the
MCG segment being top of that list and some efficiencies across our Product Engineering Group. I'd also point to the
second phenomenon, which is the acquisition of Axxia, which is going into the Data Center Group and increases our
product – or improves our product portfolio there and the networking space is bringing along some R&D costs
associated with that. And so that's part of what is adding to the R&D spending next year.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: And I guess as my follow-on in somewhat similar, we talked a little bit about this at CES, but
Stacy, I want to get your view. Broadwell's launching in the fourth quarter and then starting to ramp now. Skylake, it
sounds like you want to continue to have that be on time in, I guess, the early part of the second half of this year. To the
extent that the Broadwell duration is shorter than normal, what sort of business implications, whether it be on the
revenue, the COGS, et cetera, line should we think of – to hit the financials throughout the year?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Well, this is Brian. Let me first kind of answer how we're looking at this. I mean we're not
going to slow Skylake down. We said it'll be the second half of this year. I don't want to slow it down because it brings
a lot of innovation, a lot of new capability to this market. We think we've managed between the SKUs of what SKUs
we're bringing out on Broadwell to really refresh the two-in-one devices, the Chromebooks. We wanted to bring Core
M out, which I think in the first part of this year with the Chinese New Year, the back-to-school season, having these
super-thin and light devices is going to be critical. So missing that by doing something else with Broadwell would have
been a mistake. I think getting that volume is a good thing.
We think we've managed the transition on a number of SKUs Broadwell will have and how we'll transition the market
to Skylake now moving forward. From a margin or COGS standpoint, but remember, they're on the same technology,
so the same piece of silicon, it's the same factory. All we do is change the piece of glass in the scanner to get a different
product. So there's not a change or revamp of our factories that needs to occur for this.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, that last point is important. They're both 14-nanometer products for us, so it doesn't – it
hasn't changed our factory profile. And just generally, the faster we bring out new features and cool stuff to the market,
the better off we are. So we're not planning to slow down Skylake, if that was at the heart of your question.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Great. Thank you.

The next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.
<Q - Christopher James Muse>: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question,
Brian, I wanted to, I guess, clarify a comment you made earlier. I think you said that you were driving $800 million out
of the business in Mobility in 2015, including reorg to drive efficiencies. And I guess my question here is, does that
include also the benefit of lower contra-revenues?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yes.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And that's an all-in number.

<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah. That's – so it's the efficiencies we'll gain from the organizational structure. We're
doing continued, just, I'll call it fundamental cost reduction, getting the right P-mix in there, reducing the board count,
board layers, that kind of, I'll call, basic engineering and the introduction – or the increased percentage of Bay Trail
cost reduction at the beginning, and then introduction of SoFIA in the second half, which has no contra-revenue. So
you put all of those together, and they'll add up to that $800 million.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And the ramp of LTE. That's the [indiscernible] (46:24)
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: [indiscernible] (46:24)
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Christopher James Muse>: Great. And then I guess as my follow-up, can you provide, I guess, some additional
color on the Rockchip and Spreadtrum side? Would love to hear what milestones perhaps we should be watching for.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: I think – let's start with Rockchip. Rockchip, that we've actually been working with them
on their first design, it's an enhancement to the 3G, so it's SoFIA 3G-R, you'll see it. It's got some enhancements to the
graphics and some other functionality. I think you'll see that in 2015. They've already got their first silicon out. You'll
have to go talk to them. Again, part of it is, they have a certain level of independence. They're going to ramp and
launch that product when they feel ready, but it's – the first silicon's out, and [indiscernible] (47:14) going out there,
validation and certification. So we're right on schedule. I'd say actually we're slightly ahead of schedule with Rockchip.
And we'll continue to bring designs, and next one, we'll move to LTE just like ours, and then keep moving on just right
in line with ours, just a little bit, maybe a quarter or two after our exemplary product as well.
From Spreadtrum, we've – that deal closed more in the second half of the year. We've started to work with them with
the product definitions done and working on exactly what their SoFIA will look like. And we'll progress through that
through this year, but the relationship and, kind of, the model of having them produce SoFIA derivatives with
additional features or additional capabilities targeted towards their specific market and channels is exactly the same
methodology that we'll take.
<Q - Christopher James Muse>: Very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, C.J. And operator, we're going to go ahead and take two more questions, please.

The next question comes from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity.
<Q - Matt D. Ramsay>: Thank you very much for taking my question. Brian, I wanted to ask on DCG, obviously a
really big quarter in December, up about $1 billion from the March quarter. [indiscernible] (48:38) about it being
lumpy with the cloud customers. Maybe you can talk about what part of that big jump in revenue from September to
December was from first-time purchases of Grantley. And I guess the longer-term question I'm asking is the health of
the enterprise server market relative to some weaker trends we saw earlier in the year and a recovery in the back half of
2014? Thanks.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, this is Stacy. We're not going to get that granular, I don't think, Matt, in terms of the
breakout of the DCG revenue. I would say what we saw in Q4 was we saw strength in enterprise and then we continued
to see those robust growth rates in Cloud and networking and data analytics. Beyond that, I'm not going to break it out.
<Q - Matt D. Ramsay>: Fair enough. And Brian, as a follow-up, in the Mobile group, obviously, great work in hitting
the target on the tablet units. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the market reception and the health of the channel
for those products, particularly since a lot of those are Chinese OEMs with sort of the set-up for Chinese New Year on
the tablet side. Thanks.

<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. Let's see. I'd tell you that market reception in the channel so far for the Intel tablets
has been very strong. There is a strong brand value just in the Intel tied to a tablet, no matter who is the manufacturer.
The tablets we've made with Lenovo and Dell and many of the, I'll call, major OEMs have been selling very well. And
you saw the great reception that the Dell Venue 8, for example, 7000, got at CES. I'll call it the more broad products
that are coming out of China, more of the Shenzhen marketplace, so far they've been selling quite well. And I'd say the
number of OEMs that are working with us in that space and the amount of innovation and breadth that they're bringing
to these products has surpassed even what our expectations were. And as we show them things like RealSense and
WiDi and WiGig, all these capabilities, both in the tablet and the PC space, we're seeing a lot of innovation coming out
of that Chinese market, Chinese manufacturer space.

The final question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thank you for taking my question. My first one, Brian, how important is the recovery in emerging
markets to maintaining your expectations for a flattish PC growth? And how are you balancing the push there in terms
of the low-cost tablets versus PCs?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So, if you remember, Vivek, what we said for the year was we'd be roughly flat in
units. We also forecasted a roughly similar worldwide economic or worldwide demand scenario as what we're seeing
today. So we did not build in a big recovery or big resurgence of the emerging markets into our 2015 model. So we're
not dependent on an emerging market recovery or return in order to make our numbers for 2015.
The next question you asked is what about tablets and the low-end tablet, and I'd really say it's the low-end tablet and
the emergence of the phablet in that space versus the PC. And we think that if I took a look at that, the phablet is
probably taking a little bit more out of the tablet than the PC. I think people still are going to use the PC for their
high-end usages when they have to have a keyboard, when they have to have the higher end compute.
And for the low-end, kind of I want to look at the material, I want to watch a video, I want to scan my data: it's the
phablet and the tablet that are kind of battling it out for the user in that space, I'd say. And you see the large growth
that's occurring in phablets in the emerging markets. So bottom line, we're not expecting the emerging market recovery.
We're not building our forecast on that. And so that's why we're feeling comfortable with our current PC forecast.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up. You mentioned the ramp in discrete LTE. I know you have
done very well at Samsung. Any more progress there? And just broadly customer diversification on your LTE chip for
this year? Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah, we continue to win other customers. We don't talk about customers until the
products are launched. But we're pretty comfortable with the design wins we're getting. You see it, as you said, there's
some at Samsung; there's some at Lenovo, you'll see them coming into Rockchip and Spreadtrum in the second half of
the year with their parts, their SoFIA parts. And there are several others. We just aren't going to talk about those until
they are ready to announce the products.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thank you.
