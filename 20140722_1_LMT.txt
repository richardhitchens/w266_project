With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to have the opportunity to
review our second quarter results with you. As today's release detailed, we had a strong quarter operationally and
financially. All reported results exceeded our expectations and we are progressing on achievement of our full year
financial objectives. These results reflect the execution being achieved across our businesses as the corporation
operated at a very strong level in providing critical solutions to our customers while returning value to our
stockholders.
Our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the corporation and I thank them for all that they do on a daily
basis. Our strong year-to-date financial performance also enabled us to again increase full year 2014 guidance for
segment and consolidated operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. Bruce will cover the financial
results in detail later.
First, I want to congratulate our Mission Systems and Training team on their successful capture of three key new
business awards this past quarter, as well as recognize our Space Systems group for their capture of a multibillion
dollar extension on an essential national security program.
One of the highlights of the quarter was Mission Systems and Training's competitive win of the Space Fence program.
This contract will enable our corporation to provide a critical capability to our nation for tracking more than 200,000
orbiting space objects and increase the ability to prevent collisions with space-based debris.
MST was also notified of two significant helicopter new business events this quarter, with announcements from the
U.S. Air Force on the combat search and rescue helicopter program award, and from the Naval Air Systems Command
with the award of the VXX presidential helicopter replacement program. These awards will utilize our systems
engineering expertise as we provide significant capabilities on these important helicopter recapitalization programs.
Our role will be to support Sikorsky, who is the prime contractor on both these programs.
Turning to Space Systems, our team was able to expand a key franchise program with their receipt of additional
production lots for spacecraft 5 and 6 on the Space Based Infrared System, SBIRS. SBIRS spacecraft provide essential
missile defense and warning capabilities to our nation and allies to counter the growing proliferation of offensive
ballistic missiles around the world. These new awards expand our backlog of work and help position our corporation
for long-term growth in core markets.
In addition to the notable new business awards, we also announced two strategic acquisitions in closely aligned core
business areas. To expand our portfolio of satellite launch preparation services, we acquired Astrotech Space
Operations. Their addition complements our existing capabilities in satellite design, production, and integration.
We also announced the acquisition of Zeta Associates to further strengthen our national security capabilities in the
areas of collection, processing, safeguarding, and dissemination of critical information for intelligence and defense
communities. Closing of both of these acquisitions is expected to occur in the third quarter and they will be managed
by our Space Systems business area.
I would like to move to F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and provide a summary status of the program. New business support
of the program continues to grow with announcements in this quarter from two of our cooperative partner countries to
procure the F-35 for their future fighter needs. Australia announced their decision to purchase 58 additional F-35
aircraft, bringing their total current procurement level to 72 aircraft. Additionally, Turkey finalized their commitment to
procure their initial buy of F-35 fighters, reflecting their confidence in the program to provide fifth-generation fighter
capability to their nation.
It's exciting to see expanding levels of international and domestic procurement of the aircraft as we work to deliver
these revolutionary assets to our nation and allies. While we had numerous accomplishments on the development

program this past quarter, we were obviously disappointed with the necessary grounding of the aircraft fleet in response
to an engine fire and damage to an Air Force jet at Eglin Air Force Base on June 23. Subsequent engineering and safety
analysis including an inspection of the entire F-35 aircraft fleet have been completed. Flight operations was allowed to
resume last week but with some limitations until a final root cause of the engine failure and identification of any
corrective actions is completed.
I'd like to turn to some of the accomplishments achieved this quarter on the development program that included
achieving over 17,000 cumulative flight hours on the program, demonstrating air-to-air combat capability and
completing the first flight test with version 3i software. Another significant accomplishment was the successful landing
of a carrier variant aircraft at the maximum test speed and drop rate. This success further paves the way to conducting
carrier landings at sea later this year.
In the software arena we are conducting final checkout and testing of the version 2B software and are confident of
being ready for initial operating capability of the STOVL aircraft in 2015 for the U.S. Marine Corps. We are also
progressing well on version 3i software that will achieve the planned IOC for the Air Force variant aircraft in 2016.
Before leaving the F-35, I'd like to briefly outline our recently announced Blueprint for Affordability agreement with
the Department of Defense on the Joint Strike Fighter program. This agreement is designed to reduce the price of a new
F-35 to under $80 million in then-year dollars by 2019 at a level at or below the price of fourth-generation fighters.
Achievement of cost reductions will enable domestic and international customers to buy a fifth-generation fighter with
its far more advanced technology and capabilities as they [ph] capitalize (8:04) their fighter fleets. The need to replace
fourth-generation fighters is becoming even more acute due to the aging of the current fleet and increased strategic
threats to the aircraft.
The agreement calls for our corporation and key subcontractors Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to make total
combined investments of up to $170 million in affordability initiatives from 2014 to 2016. Recoupment of our
investments with an acceptable return is included in the agreement after achievement of reduced cost of F-35 aircraft in
future years. Our focus on cost reductions and affordability will be aided by this agreement as we strive to produce the
F-35 for our customers at the lowest possible price.
Beyond the F-35, I was in the United Kingdom last week at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford and also at
the Farnborough International Airshow, where I had the opportunity to meet with many current and potential
customers. My impression from those meetings is that the demand for our portfolio of products is strong and growing.
We see broad-based customer interests in areas ranging from fighter and cargo aircraft to missile defense systems,
tactical missiles, C4ISR and IT solutions.
Customers are very interested in our evolving technologies, focus areas where we are working to extend and expand the
value and capabilities of our core programs. One item that I would highlight as a demonstration of our focus on
providing innovative and different capabilities to an existing program was seen on our LM-100J commercial airlifter
program. The LM-100J is the civil version of our proven and cost effective C-130J Super Hercules aircraft and builds
upon the legacy of the airlifter for new commercial customers.
We were particularly pleased to announce that we secured a letter of intent for our new LM-100J commercial airlifter.
This customer has the opportunity to purchase up to 10 aircraft and we believe the potential demand for this airlifter
will only grow in the future.
A final topic I'd like to speak briefly about is the decision we made this past quarter outlining revisions in our defined
benefit pension plan for salaried employees. We took actions to freeze certain of our qualified and non-qualified
defined benefit pension plans in a two-phased approach and transition the affected employees to an enhanced defined
contribution retirement savings plan.
Taking these actions will allow us to better manage our financial obligations at a more predictable rate while still
providing valuable retirement savings to employees. Our goal is to offer competitive benefits that align with our global
security and aerospace peers while also attracting and retaining the talent that is so vital to our success.

These changes will provide current and future employees with an employee retirement savings plan that is very
competitive in the marketplace while positioning our pension expenses on a more affordable and sustainable level for
the corporation.
I'll now ask Bruce to go through the details of second quarter financial performance and our increased 2014 guidance
and then we'll open up the line for your questions. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along
with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.
Let's start with Chart 3 and an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $11.3 billion, down slightly from last
year but actually a little ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was strong at $1.4 billion. And this
performance, along with the improvement in our FAS/CAS pension adjustment, increased net earnings by 3% and
increased earnings per share to $2.76. We had a stronger cash quarter than expected, generating $977 million in cash
from operations and we increased our full-year outlook for operating profit, EPS and cash from operations. So I think
we had a strong quarter and first half of the year.
Turning to Chart 4 and comparing our sales and segment operating profit results for the second quarter of this year
versus last year, sales were down slightly compared with last year, but as I just noted, this was ahead of our
expectations. Segment operating profit was about $100 million lower than the same period last year but last year had
the benefits of contractual resolutions that were not repeated this year. Adjusting for these favorable items, our segment
operating performance was comparable to last year and again was broad-based across our business areas.
Chart 5 shows that earnings per share increased by $0.12 or 5% over last year. EPS grew despite the lower segment
operating profit due to the change in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment from an expense last year to income this year.
On Chart 6 we'll compare our cash from operations with the second quarter of last year. Cash generated was just under
$1 billion in the quarter or 57% higher than the second quarter last year. The strong performance in the second quarter
led to an increase in our outlook for the year as we'll discuss on the next chart.
Chart 7 provides our current outlook compared with what we provided in the first quarter. We're maintaining our orders
outlook at between $41.5 billion and $43 billion but we're actually ahead of our planned order level through the first six
months. We have the large C-130 multi-year order planned for late in the fourth quarter and, with the size of that order,
we believe it prudent to leave the order outlook unchanged.
Similarly for sales, we are tracking nicely to our current guidance. We're increasing our outlook for segment operating
profit by $125 million, reflecting the strong performance through the first half of the year.
With the changes we announced this quarter to freeze our pension plan, we were required to re-measure our pension
assets and benefit obligations. In addition to the freeze, the re-measurement incorporated a new longevity estimate
along with a lower discount rate and the net effect of these changes was a $100 million increase in our FAS/CAS
pension income for the next six months.
We increased our operating profit outlook by $225 million to recognize both the segment operating profit and
FAS/CAS pension income increases. We also increased our earnings per share guidance by $0.35 and we'll discuss this
in more detail in a couple of charts. Finally, we increased cash from operations by $100 million to greater than or equal
to $4.8 billion.
On Chart 8, we have our sales outlook for the year by business area, which remains unchanged.
Chart 9 shows our updated guidance for segment operating profit. We increased the outlook for operating profit by
$105 million for Space Systems and by $20 million for Aeronautics. For Space Systems this reflects strong
performance to-date along with growing confidence that two large delivery events planned for the second half of the

year will both happen this year. The increase in profit for Aeronautics recognizes the performance through the first half
of the year being ahead of our expectations.
Moving on to Chart 10, we'll discuss the increase in our earnings per share guidance. The $125 million increase in
segment operating profit raised our outlook by $0.25 per share, while the $100 million increase in FAS/CAS pension
income raised the outlook by another $0.20 per share.
In addition, we reevaluated certain tax reserve positions, resulting in an increase in tax expense in the second quarter.
Netting all these changes, our new earnings per share guidance increased a total of $0.35 for the year to a new range of
between $10.85 and $11.15 per share.
On Chart 11, we thought it'd be helpful to describe how the pension changes we've made will affect our expectations
for FAS/CAS income and pension funding and recovery over the next few years. As with all these projections, it's
important to remember that they're all based on current regulations and include our June 2014 assumptions for a
discount rate at 4.25%, which is 50 basis points lower than what we used at the end of last year. The projections also
incorporate new longevity estimate assumptions, our long-term asset return of 8% and demographics holding constant,
or, as I like to say, current course and speed.
We expect lower FAS expense in the future and that would make our FAS/CAS income in 2015 about twice the 2014
level and increasing the 2016 level about $0.5 billion above the 2015 level. For pension funding and recovery, we
would expect our contributions to the pension trust over the next few years to be similar to or lower than the 2014 level
and the future benefits associated with the roughly $10 billion we have funded but not yet recovered would remain
intact. Recoveries in 2015 and 2016 are expected to be sequentially higher than 2014 and essentially keeping pace with
the increases in FAS/CAS income over the next two years.
And finally, Chart 12 provides our summary for the quarter. We're pleased with the performance through the first half
of the year as it results from continued strong program execution along with taking proactive measures and the benefits
of a portfolio of programs that is second to none. We expect to resume discretionary share repurchases in the third
quarter and this leaves us well positioned to achieve the higher outlooks that we provided today.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Shannon?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. You may begin.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher, III>: Morning, Sam.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the investments you're making in
terms of the F-35 to reduce the costs. I guess I'm wondering, does it impact your booking margin on the program and
how much is it shared amongst your partners? Because it would seem like near term it should have a downward effect
even if you can then recover it on the back end. So I'm just trying to understand how the mechanics of that work.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Bruce, why don't you take that?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Sam, I'll jump in there. So we're calling this the Blueprint for Affordability. As
Marillyn said, the overall objective is to put our money where our mouth is, quite frankly, because we think there are
investments that could be made that will reduce the cost of the aircrafts over the next few years below what it would
otherwise track to.

Page 6 of 15
And so the thought is, as Marillyn said, about $170 million – up to $170 million spread over a couple of years. You
should think of that, Sam, as proportional, in terms of the investment contributions, to the work share of our partners.
So Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and BAE would be expected – although it's not required because not all the
investments, frankly, will fall along that line, but for planning purposes you should expect it's proportional to the work
share that we each have there.
The recovery of that is tied to achieving those cost reductions. And as Marillyn said, we would expect to recover that
investment plus an appropriate return on that investment. So Sam, to your question on booking rate impact, I don't
expect this to have any negative impact on the booking rates for those lots affected unless we are unable to achieve the
cost reductions that we are projecting in the basis for those investments. So if we do what we say we can do then you
would see no impact on booking rates as a result of that.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: I just want to add though that this really is an exciting acquisition reform type of an
initiative. We think it's groundbreaking in terms of bringing this to the F-35 program. We've been working closely with
the Department of Defense for the past year to come up with this agreement and it lines right up with Frank Kendall's
blueprint, his Better Buying Power 2.0, and where they've asked us to come up with innovative ways to drive down
cost. As Bruce said, just volume will bring the cost down. We expect that. Probably 75% to 80% of the cost reduction
comes through just ramping up production.
So the numbers that I cited around bringing the cost of the aircraft down will depend first and foremost on that volume
reduction, but at the same time, where we make these investments in cost reduction initiatives, that'll be the balance of
it, to bring it down to a fourth generation priced aircraft by 2019 in then-year dollars. So we're very excited about – and
we've already got projects underway.

Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. You may begin.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Bruce, could you walk through some of the puts and takes in the pension numbers,
headwinds and tailwinds? Obviously, the discount rate, we have that from the K [10-K] but the mortality and then the
upside from the freeze?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, so are you talking about the FAS/CAS income change for the next six months
[indiscernible] (22:36)?
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Yeah, all the details. You've netted the number to a positive $100 million, right?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, let me give you the pieces, and I should point out, Rob, that what I'm going to talk
through today is also going to be in the 10-Q that you'll see filed tomorrow. So we started off with an expectation of
FAS/CAS pension income of about $345 million for the year. You should think of the design change that we are
incorporating. So that comes in two stages. We have a freezing of the salary benefit effective 01/01/2016 and then we
have the services benefit will freeze in 01/01/2020 and that'll be, essentially, a full freeze of the pension plan at that
point in time.
The results of those amendment changes, if you will, is an improvement of about $435 million compared to what we
otherwise would have had without that. We actually had a positive through the first six months of the year that we
recognized when we were required to re-measure assets and benefit obligations. We did better.

Our long-term assumption for the rate of return on assets is 8%. So if you just break that into two six months chunks,
you would have said the first six months should have been about a 4% return. We actually did better than that and that
better return resulted in an $85 million net improvement.
The increased longevity impact for the year is about a $265 million negative impact to the income that would otherwise
have occurred this year. And then the discount rate reduction, again, about 50 bps, as I said earlier, is about $155
million. So hopefully, if my math's right, that walks us from the $345 million to the $445 million pension income and
that's the net $100 million benefit there. Does that work, Rob? I'll say yes.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Co. You may begin.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you. I think you've just answered my question. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thanks, Cai.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. You may begin.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Marillyn, your focus on affordability is notable. I think because the
Pentagon and the Navy called out two of your business units for getting top procurement awards. How important is that
and what does that say about how you're going to push the rest of the business units to capture those sort of
achievements?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Howard, thank you for your question and thanks for the recognition for the folks that are
doing the right thing that the Navy and others have focused on our performance. And we're excited about that. And
frankly, affordability is a daily focus for us across the entire corporation. Every one of our business areas is tracking to
drive cost out of the business and look at how they can bring innovation forward into some of their products in order to
make them more affordable for the customer.
So it isn't just those that happened to get a recognition from our customer, which we highly value and appreciate, but it
is across the business that we are doing this. And I know if you look back at what we've done in terms of reducing our
footprint with our square footage reductions, shutting down some of our facilities, things that we're doing across our
overhead structure and our expenditures.
And at the same time, how we're looking at making sure that we're performing on a daily basis, so that if you look at
our operational execution this quarter and for the past several quarters, I've never seen our programs performing better.
We're putting out quality products on time, under budget and meeting the commitments of our customers.
The recognition that you highlighted was from the Navy and not all of our business areas work with the Navy. So we
would seek similar recognition from other services where it's warranted because we are across the board working on
affordability. Thanks for the question.

<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Bruce, I wanted to pursue a little bit more in Aeronautics. I mean you basically have a lot
of puts and takes there. I mean like you get $40 million more F-22 sales and pick up $35 million profit. The R&D
program's explained by – you took the charge last year. F-35 sales are up $210 million, but no change in the profit. So
is that an issue of where you are in the LRIP program? So if you just explained some of those comments?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, so maybe I'll just hit all the moving pieces in Aeronautics, George, and hopefully I'll
capture the intent of your question there. So collectively I think – let's see, we were up about 13%, sales at Aeronautics,
almost $450 million, about in line with what our expectations were. We said all along that we expected to have
Aeronautics be really the only business area that has any significant growth to speak of; that, of course, was led by the
F-35 program.
You mentioned about $210 million of that came from the production program. The total F-35 program was just under
$300 million, with the difference coming on SDD contract. Most of that increase on the SDD coming because we don't
have the negative profit adjustment that was taken in the same quarter of last year.
C-130s were up about $75 million or so. Really it was just one additional aircraft this year versus last. C-5, a similar
story, one additional aircraft and it was up about $45 million. So that is attributable to one additional aircraft but it was
partially offset because of a little bit of lower support in spares this year compared to last.
And as you said, the F-22 was about $40 million. Almost all that F-22 sales volume resulted from the higher risk
retirements on a number of programs within the F-35 program that were about $35 million of that $40 million in total.
So I think your question was the F-35 production program up about $210 million while the profit level was flat. And
that's right. And what that really results from, George, is just as you speculated, we did have a number of higher risk
retirements in the second quarter of last year that were not repeated this year. I think that's just the phasing of when
those events occurred. And it's not something that's causing a long-term concern on my part and I think we're
performing, actually, very well in the production programs, writ large, as we sit here today.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gursky of Citi. You may begin.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask a question on missile defense and MEADS versus
Patriot. Can you just describe a little bit on where we are today with MEADS from a revenue perspective and if we
don't get any additional deals signed there, when does that revenue stream trail off? And then maybe just talk a little bit
about the competitive environment, MEADS versus Patriot, and how much you care, either way, which direction this
all goes?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Bruce, you take the revenue question and I'll talk a little bit about the competitive
environment.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. You had the same thoughts I did there, Marillyn. So I was trying to write those down
as you were talking, Jason. So revenue stream and what's the current level of...
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: [indiscernible] (31:05).
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, current revenue level. You should think of it as fairly minimal right now. And that's
primarily because the development program that it's been undergoing for the better part of – I don't know – five, six,
seven years or so has now wound down to the end. So the actual sales or revenue that is being generated by the
program this year is not all that consequential.
When that would fall off is when the development program finishes, which is, if not close to the end of this year,
maybe a little bit into early next year. But that's the profile you should think of in terms of the revenue profile that we're
looking at.

And then so what we're obviously trying to do is now convert this from this program that has finished the end of its
development into a production contract, and that's what we're trying to do. That's what we're trying to do in Poland and
I think the next opportunity is probably going to come up in Germany. And I'll let Marillyn, maybe, discuss the more
strategic views of MEADS versus Patriot.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Sure. Thanks, Bruce, and we are continuing MEADS. Frankly, I'll just say right up front,
we're disappointed that the Polish government announced that they are down-selected to two offerings and MEADS
didn't make that down-select, because we really believe it offers the best capability. It's the most modern mobile unit.
It's 360-degree capability, open architecture. So it's got all the things that we think was a very good offering for the
Polish government.
At the same time, as you know, Italy and Germany have invested a significant amount of their funds into the program,
collectively with the U.S. government. And the next opportunity for us is to continue to work with Germany and Italy
on developing their future air and missile defense systems. Germany will be making a decision later this year. We feel
very good about how MEADS will stack up in that competition. As I said, they've made a significant investment. They
understand the capabilities. So we expect that to be strong.
The program itself, as Bruce said, we're going to continue through the development phase on it and we also expect that
the U.S. Army will continue to review it and figure out how they can harvest some of the technology from MEADS.
Also, just to highlight for you, we still benefit as well from the Patriot system because, as you saw, the recent
opportunity with Qatar being announced and others, we are on the Patriot system with our missiles, so with the PAC-3.
So both systems we'll have an opportunity for but we are front-and-center in the marketplace with MEADS and expect
that Germany and Italy will look seriously and there are other countries as well.

Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. You may begin.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Doug.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Staying on this area, Missiles and Fire Control orders were lighter than normal during the
quarter, and I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how you're looking at the outlook for that group in terms of
order flow? And obviously PAC-3, THAAD, those are important parts of that. So maybe you can give us a sense of
where the international opportunities are and how you see that unit moving over time?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, I'll take that one on, Doug. So I think the biggest near-term international order for
Missiles and Fire Control is probably the PAC-3 for Qatar. Marillyn mentioned that as well just a second ago and so
that's probably one that we're looking for, hopefully. I think we had a signing ceremony in the Pentagon here in the last
couple of weeks that will lead to a contract award to us, hopefully sometime in the third quarter.
One that may not be on your scope, Doug, but it's a big-sized order for us and it's one that's worth discussing, is
potentially about a $1 billion order for the Scout fighting vehicle in the UK. This is basically putting a new turret and
new capabilities on an existing combat fighting vehicle in the UK and that's being performed by our LMUK operation.
So that's a fairly sizeable opportunity that we're very excited about. We think that actually has some export potential
even beyond the UK for that vehicle.
So those are two of the bigger ones that we're looking at in terms of international orders, but I'll just say, just looking at
the rest of the year, the expectation for Missiles and Fire Control is we'll probably get back to about the similar level of
backlog as where we ended the year at 2013. And of course, we always have the fourth quarter of our calendar year
being the first quarter of the new fiscal year, and we tend to get a lot of our domestic orders in that quarter and I would

Thank you. Our next question is from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer. You may begin.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Great. Thank you. For Space Systems, you mentioned that the EBIT upside relative to the prior
guidance is going to come from two deliveries now happening in the back half. Why didn't that impact the sales
guidance as well?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, so it's a good question, Yair, and let me just say, there's probably, I'll say maybe like
three moving pieces that are going on in the Space guidance and I'll address the sales as well here. But so first and
foremost, we've had better performance year-to-date and some of that has come on the back of the United Launch
Alliance. That higher to-date performance is going to carry out through the rest of the year. So that's part of the increase
there.
Secondly, you recall, probably in both the fourth quarter call of last year and the first quarter call this year, I talked
about some continuing restructuring charges particularly as we're shutting down some facilities and relocating
operations from those facilities elsewhere within the Space Systems portfolio.
So those charges have actually turned out to be a little lighter than we expected that they would be when we set the
guidance for this year. Importantly to note, they're still back-half-loaded in the year, but the total year is expected to be
lower than what we initially envisioned when we gave the guidance for 2014.
And then specifically to your point on the two launch vehicles, we probably had a little more contingency or
conservatism in our profit guidance associated with those items, only because our profit guidance range is pretty
narrow, frankly, for Space Systems Company. I think it's about – what is it? – $30 million or so from the low end to the
high end.
These are items that are probably at that size at least, collectively, whereas the sales is probably contained within the
$300 million range that we give already for the sales guidance. So while I recognize why that could seem like a
disconnect, I think it's because of the size of the ranges for sales versus the size of the ranges for earnings.

Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good morning everyone.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good Morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Bruce, I wanted to get a capital deployment update from you. On M&A, you guys have been
doing smaller things in areas of growth. Others in the space have suggested M&A could pick up. I wonder if you think
that's possible? What's the probability that that annual number for Lockheed moves into the billions rather than
hundreds of millions? And then on the share repurchase, any color you could give on the anticipated pace at which that
picks back up since you mentioned that's going to happen?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So Noah, I'll jump in a little bit on the M&A question and I'll see if Marillyn has any,
maybe, higher, overarching thoughts than I provide. But so I think the short answer – your question, if I could repeat it,
was: you've done some smaller acquisitions, and what's the potential that we could end up with maybe more than $1
billion in a year instead of several hundred millions of dollars in a year?

Page 11 of 15
I think the short answer to that is it's opportunistic. We've always said, at least since I've been in this job, we look at a
heck of a lot more opportunities for M&A than we ever execute on. And that's because we don't think all of them make
sense, obviously.
And so if we find more deals that make sense for us, both strategically, financially and operationally, then we'll close
that. There's not a certain number, if you will, that we're trying to stay below or try to exceed in getting that number.
So I think, historically, if you take a look at our capital deployment and our share repurchase plan, we ended the year
last year at about $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We've grown that. I think we're, what, about $3.4 billion or
so today.
I think I said on the last call that we would probably try to get to a share repurchase level that would bring us about in
line with where we ended last year with cash on the balance sheet, and you can probably solve for that number better
than I can, frankly. But that's probably my best indication of what the remaining expectation, at least on our part, is for
share repurchases through the rest of the year.
And I'll ask and see if Marillyn has any different thoughts on the M&A question?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Not different, Bruce. I think you covered it well. I mean we will continue to look at
selective acquisitions that really make sense for us. And we will look at things that give us new access to markets or
some unique technology or capability, or things that fit with our core or that are very near to our core, just as the ones
that we have done in the past quarter line up very well with our core business.
And we recently, in the previous quarter, we bought Industrial Defender, which is a leading provider for cybersecurity
solutions. So you can look at the things that we're buying and if they create value and they're strategically and
operationally line up with what we want to do then we're going to continue to look for those opportunities.
But as you can tell from what Bruce has described, I mean we have a lot of capability on our balance sheet to do what
we think makes sense. We're just going to go along our normal process of assessing and determining if it's a good fit for
us.

Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Yeah. Thanks so much. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rob.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Bruce, just a couple of quick guidance questions. What do you expect the full-year tax rate to
be? And also, what are the factors that you see weighing on the Aeronautics margin in the second half? Thank you.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Thanks, Rob. So I think we'll be somewhere, in the thick of it, probably in the 32%
range, maybe a little bit lower than that as we sit here today. So one wild card, obviously, is whether or not we have the
R&D tax credit between now and the end of the year and/or, while I believe we'll ultimately get an R&D tax credit
some point in the future, whether it happens this year or we have the retroactive event like happened last year. I'd hate
to predict that. But that's not included in the tax numbers that I just gave to you, Rob.
And the second question was on Aeronautics and the second half of the year. So as we sit here today, we've actually
had very good performance through the first six months for Aeronautics, as I said probably repeatedly in the opening
remarks, better than our expectations.
As we look today at the guidance that we're providing, that would suggest that we're going to have lower margins in the
second half of the year than the first half of the year. Not hugely lower, but that's the result of, probably, lower planned

risk retirements as we sit here today and think of how we are planning for those risk retirements in the future.
The first half had the benefit of some of those exceeding our expectations. And I think there's some potential upside
that we could exceed our expectations of what we have planned for those second half risk retirements today.
And the other piece that has a negative push on margins in the second half is, obviously, the rising volume of the F-35
program at the lower margins than the overall Aeronautics margin. That will continue to happen in the second half of
the year as well.

Thank you. Our next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. First just a clarification, Bruce, you gave us a ton of moving
parts in the pension, but if you can just give us what the FAS and the CAS components were? But the actual question is
more on Space where this is the fourth year in a row where you're going to put up 13%, maybe better, margins. Looks
like there's even some conservatism left for the second half. Is this a 13% margin business on a go-forward basis?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Myles, it's surprised me a little bit. So Space has the benefit, obviously – I'm going to answer
your second question first and I'll come back to the FAS/CAS. So Space has the benefit of getting quite a significant
portion of equity earnings associated with our 50/50 joint venture in the United Launch Alliance. So the actual margins
on the rest of Space's business, because we're recognizing the profit but not recognizing the sales, has a boost in the
profit that's not inherent in the rest of the portfolio.
We also have a joint venture in the UK where we're also accounting for it with equity earnings, through the Atomic
Weapons Establishment, although it's a much lower piece of it, so that you should think of the two of those as adding a
pretty good boost to the margins of Space. And those have increased over the past few years over what they were, say,
three years, four years, five years ago.
We also had the transition in Space of having a number of programs in concurrent development and almost every single
one of those programs is now in full-rate production; as much as I can say full-rate production for Space, which is
usually small quantities of spacecraft.
So programs like SBIRS, Advanced EHF, [ph] MUELs (46:50), even, to a certain extent, the GPS III. We're on the
tail-end or hopefully completed with the development of a lot of those satellites and we're now in production and you
would expect to see higher margins during that performance. Also, I'll just say the performance on a number of our
Special Programs activities within Space has been outstanding, both from a capabilities perspective as well as the
financial performance there.
So whether or not we can continue that, Myles, I think we've got a little bit of, actually, negative, as I talked about
earlier, in terms of the restructuring cost that eventually will go away. You should also think, though, that we have
about $40 million a year, I think, associated with the formation of ULA that is a recurring benefit that I think expires in
2016 or 2017. I've lost track which.
So that's associated with the gain we had on the contribution to form United Launch Alliance and it got spread over 10
years. So will those offset the restructuring charges going away in the end of that recurring benefit at the end of the 10
years? That's the challenge for us and to see whether or not we can maintain that streak.
So I think you asked specifically: what are the FAS/CAS numbers? So I gave you the net at $445 million. CAS does
not change. So that's still, think of it roughly, $1.6 billion and the FAS expense, and I'm rounding some numbers here, I
think FAS expense changes to about $1.15 billion for the year. And I think that probably nets to $450 million but that's
the [ph] close-to-the-pen (48:46) math.

Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. You may begin.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Morning. I wanted to drill a little bit into the Mission Systems and Training segment. First of
all, just if you could give a little color on the reserves you recorded on the programs in the quarter?
And then just secondly, and maybe higher level, I think this was the first quarter where you had negative profit
adjustments since you started giving all that level of detail over the last three years. And I know you had the tough
compare with the settlement of presidential helicopter from last year, but higher level, what's the momentum in terms
of performance in this segment, because it's been so good over the last couple years? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, so I'll try [ph] some (49:36) moving pieces there, Joe. Thanks for the questions. So
most of the reserve or I guess all the reserve that we took in the quarter is really associated with the Training &
Logistics solutions part of the business.
This is a part of the business that really serves a variety of customers, including the U.S. government, international
customers, as well as commercial customers. And you should think of this business, at least in large part, you have to
have products developed and ready for the market in order to be able to be competitive in this marketplace, which
means to me that you have to sometimes make bets in terms of the configurations, the capabilities and the quantities of
these new products. We probably didn't make all the right bets here and so we established some reserves in the case
that some of the risk associated with some of the inventory that's on the balance sheet today simply doesn't find a home
in the long term.
You talked about this being the first quarter of the negative hit there and you're right. What I'm pleased with is
essentially even with that reserve that we established for the Training & Logistics solutions business, there were
offsetting step-ups or risk retirements that mitigated, essentially to the full extent that reserve that was established, such
that the net change for the quarter-over-quarter was really just the change in the contractual resolutions that happened
last year that didn't happen this year. So that's the way I think of it. While the big reserve that was established, we also
have big risk retirements that were planned in the quarter that helped to mitigate that.
I will say that the second half step-ups that are planned, at least from a risk retirement perspective, in the second half of
the year are probably going to be comparable to what we saw in the second half of 2013. And I always say that's the
current planning and the current thinking as we sit here today. So thanks for the questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from John Godyn of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Hey. Thank you for taking my question. Bruce, just two clarifications, a little bit separate.
First, on international revenue as a percentage, it looks like you're going to hit your 20% target this year. I'm curious if
there is another target that we should be thinking about years in the future? And then separately on pensions, you
presented some very good detail on FAS/CAS and prepayments. One of the areas of pushback that I sometimes hear is
that you do have a lot of contributions coming that will eat into what the cash windfall might look like. I was hoping
that you could perhaps offer some detail on that point. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Okay. So first question, John, on the international revenue and where we are, I think, if I
remember looking right, I think we did right at or just under 20% in the quarter. So you're right, we are hitting our
number. The goal is, clearly, to be higher.
One thing, frame-of-reference-wise is if we do what we believe we'll do from an orders perspective this year and we
end up at the backlog level that we're hoping for, probably 30% of that backlog could be international business. So I'll
probably defer to Marillyn as far as setting the new goal for the company, but I would like to think that if we haven't hit
the 20%, we're real close. And I would think that just by virtue of the backlog that we expect to have, we should have a

higher number than that in the years to come.
Now probably the best time for us to describe that is in October, when we gave you trend information for next year.
And frankly, we're smack in the middle of our planning process right now. So I'll probably hesitate to pick the number
directly until we've had a chance to take a look at that planning information and get back to you in the October
timeframe.
I think your second question was on the contributions coming, is that a hit? So I tried to give you some visibility into
that as far as the future contributions that we have planned in 2015 and 2016, at least, where I said they'd either be
equal to or lower than the 2014 level.
That's probably about as much insight as I want to give right now. I think the important part is the net cash, at least as I
like to think about that, and net cash is going to be increasing pretty substantially. I may have spoken in a little bit of
code when I gave that information, but hopefully you followed the information that we were providing there and that is
expecting to continue.
And the flipside that I like to always remind people is – and I talked about this in the earlier remarks – we have this $10
billion or so of advanced funding that is yet to be recovered. Just a year ago or so that was like $9 billion. Those assets
are sitting in our pension trust today, and they're accruing interest at the same rate as our asset return is making. And so
one different way to think of that, possibly, is we're doing a whole lot better with those assets invested in our pension
trust than if they were doing nothing but sitting on the balance sheet.
And so I don't think it's a bad use of that cash and as long as we can continue to satisfy the constituents in terms of
dividends, repurchases to our shareholders, doing the investments we need to make with our customers. I think that's a
good use of our overall cash deployment as we sit here today.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: I'll just add to Bruce's comments on the international side, while we're not going to give
you a specific number today, I mean aspirationally we are going to continue to grow in our international area. We're
very much focused on that expansion of our business. It is where the growth opportunities are for us. We think we're
extraordinarily well positioned with our portfolio for growth. F-35 certainly is one area, because we see in the next five
years almost 50% of the orders are going to come from the international arena.
But in addition to that, as we've talked about, our missile defense, there's an expanding demand for that around the
world. We see a lot of opportunities in the full range of our capabilities and we're going to continue to grow. We even
re-aligned our organization such that we have more leadership, and focus and resources from an enterprise standpoint
so that we can win in that marketplace. And I think that's a good thought, Bruce, that we come back in the fall to give
them that new target, but believe me, it'll be above 20%.

Thank you. Our next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning or almost good afternoon.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher, III>: Hey, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just, I wondered if you could expand a little bit on this pension piece? The delta in the FAS
number would most likely relate to the actuarial amortization, not service and interest cost I would assume, since those
aren't changing in the benefits until 2016 and 2020. Where does that bring the plan, now that you've re-measured, from
a funded status on a PBO [performance based oversight] basis?
And then when you look out longer term, if that's substantially lower, does that have a material impact on the
longer-term CAS reimbursements you'd expect to see as these prepayment credits are then collected and then you look
beyond that?

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So you got your money's worth from the question, Carter. So...
<Q - Carter Copeland>: I try my best.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: I think I'll answer your second question first. So on a FAS basis, amazingly enough, our
funded level ends up at about the same point as we ended the year last year, at about 78%, with all the moving pieces.
On an ERISA basis, which is obviously the more important one because that actually determines our funding level, we
stayed about the 90% level just, again, as where we ended the year last year.
I'm not sure I followed, frankly, the first part of your question, Carter, but I will say that – I mean, I'll just go back to
the detail that I gave, and I can't remember who I provided that to, frankly, about the pieces of the $100 million and the
various components of that in terms of pension change. So the re-measurements that we took are affecting both service
costs and actuarial losses, to use the speak of the FASB and the 10-K and 10-Q disclosures. So those did affect both the
service cost and the actuarial losses this year and they affected it just for the last six months of the year. So you should
think of those as increasing in future years only because there will be a full-year's worth of cost or service benefit
versus a half a year's for the same items there.
And I think your last question had to do with how does this affect recovery? What I've tried to convey is that I think our
recovery remains strong and I think I gave some insight as to what that would look like. And clearly, relative to this
$10 billion that we keep talking about in terms of pre-funding or funding in advance of the requirements, that is going
to continue to drive our overall cash collections for the next decade or so. And you're starting to see that materialize
now and in the not-too-distant future.

Shannon, I think that's getting us on top of the hour here. Maybe, Marillyn, some final thoughts or...?
Marillyn A. Hewson
Sure, let me wrap up. I just want to conclude today's call by reiterating that we had another excellent quarter and we, in
my view, continue to be very well positioned to deliver even higher value to our customers and our stockholders in
2014. So we want to thank you again for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you at our
next earning's call in October.
Shannon, that concludes our call today.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a
