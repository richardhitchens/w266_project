The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP
financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2015 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation
slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website

Today's discussion will begin with Ken Chenault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; who will be joined by Jeff
Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Once they complete their remarks we will move to a
Q&A session.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Ken.
Kenneth Irvine Chenault
Thanks, Toby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We have a lot to cover with you today, including a
review of our fourth quarter, an update on the Costco portfolio sale and our outlook for 2016 and 2017.
I'm joining the call today as I thought it was important to share my thoughts on the financial outlook and the evolving
operating environment. Before Jeff begins, let me acknowledge that the performance we're discussing today is not what
we or you are accustomed to seeing from American Express, and that we are taking significant actions to change the
trajectory of our business going forward.
During our remarks, we'll address three main questions. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we
doing about it? Why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long term?
So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey C. Campbell
Thanks and good afternoon everyone. To answer the questions Ken just posed, I'm going to start by explaining our
2015 results, how they've impacted our view of the future, and how they reflect the actions we are taking. I'll also
acknowledge upfront that across all the periods we're discussing, there are a large number of items adding complexity
to our results. We provided some normalizations to help you better understand the underlying performance trends.
To start on page two; our fourth quarter and full-year performance reflected the strength and the headwinds that we
have been managing throughout 2015. Versus the prior year on a reported basis, billings were up 2% for both the
quarter and the full year. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q4, which was consistent with the prior
quarter but slightly below the full-year growth rate as billings did decelerate modestly during the second half of the
year. During the quarter, revenues were down 8% year-over-year and were impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar and the
gain from the sale of our investment in Concur during the prior year.
Excluding FX and the Concur gain, adjusted revenue growth was relatively consistent sequentially at 4% during the
quarter. This was also in line with our adjusted full-year performance of 4%. Our earnings per share were $0.89 in the
quarter and $5.05 for the year, and included a charge in our Enterprise Growth business, which was driven primarily by
the impairment of goodwill and technology together with some restructuring charges. Excluding this charge, adjusted
EPS would've been $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.38 for the full year, down 3% from last year's EPS of $5.86,
which did include a net gain of about $0.10 on the global business travel and Concur transactions. This performance is
slightly above the high end of the earnings range we provided on the Q3 earnings call with the favorability primarily
driven by our continued focus on operating expenses.
In terms of key drivers for the year, our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong card acquisitions,
excellent credit performance, disciplined operating expense control, and the benefits of our strong capital position. In
particular, the accelerated new card acquisitions, loan growth, and expense control, all stem from actions we took in
late 2014 and throughout 2015 as it became clear that the environment was evolving and all these actions should further

help us in 2016 and beyond. But these positives were challenged by several factors.
First, the cumulative impact from the early renewals of our co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, British
Airways, Cathay Pacific and Iberia along with the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, reduced EPS in the
quarter and the year by approximately 5%, though we are done lapping these changes as we enter 2016.
Second, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed, reducing EPS by another approximately 3% to
4% for both the quarter and the year. At current rates, the dollar will now represent a headwind for us as we enter 2016.
Third, our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year remaining at the elevated levels we were at in
2014 further pressured our earnings in 2015, and we now intend to stay at these levels throughout 2016 before returning
to lower levels in 2017.
And last, the economic, regulatory and competitive environments all became even more challenging as the year
progressed. The combination of these factors resulted in our billings and revenue growth rates being fairly steady
throughout the year, whereas we had expected to see a sequential strengthening. Despite these challenges, we leveraged
our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and again returned over $5 billion of capital
through buybacks and dividends during 2015, which reduced our average share count by 5%. These results also
brought our reported return on equity for the period ending December 31 to 24%. Excluding the Enterprise Growth
charge, our adjusted ROE was 26% to slightly above our target and illustrates the continued strength of our business
model.
Let's now go through the components of results, beginning with billed business performance by region and segment,
which is on slides three and four. Billed business growth was 5% on an FX-adjusted basis during the fourth quarter,
consistent with Q3 and below the full-year number of 6%. Overall, our billings growth rate decelerated modestly
during 2015, while we had anticipated a sequential strengthening. Although this is disappointing, we did see positive
momentum in certain segments.
International performance, excluding Canada, continued to be strong with volumes up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis
versus the prior year during Q4. I'd note that Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian
warehouses during Q4 2014, in advance of the termination of our relationship with them as of the end of 2014.
Therefore, the drag on our ICS growth rate from Canada was smaller this quarter, and we will fully lap this impact
during the first quarter of 2016.
GNS remained our fastest-growing segment with volumes increasing 14% versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted
basis, powered by continued strong performance in China, Korea, and Japan. In the USCS segment, billings growth
remained sequentially at 5%, despite further softening in billings on the Costco co-brand product where volumes this
quarter dropped more significantly versus the prior year. I'd also note that lower gas prices continue to be a drag on
USCS growth, as average prices were down 24% versus the prior year.
GCS billed business growth continued to slow and volumes were flat versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis
during the fourth quarter. Performance continues to be impacted by lower airline volumes and a generally cautious
corporate spending environment. Looking forward into 2016, we expect to see a modest uptick in billings growth rates
beginning in the first quarter, as we lap some of the headwinds we faced in early 2015 and as our initiatives to drive
growth have more impact. Obviously, our billings growth rates during the second half of the year will be impacted by
the end of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. around mid-year.
Turning to loan performance on slide five; loans were down 17% on a reported basis, but this is entirely related to the
reclassification of a portion of our loans to held-for-sale effective December 1. We now expect the sale of the JetBlue
loan portfolio to occur during Q1, and I'll provide more details on the status of our Costco portfolio sale discussions
later in my remarks. Excluding the held-for-sale portfolios from the prior year, worldwide loans were up 7% and U.S.
loans were up 10% versus the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of FX and Canadian loan balances,
international loan growth also remained strong at 10% during Q4.
So we are pleased with the underlying trends in loan growth and that our increased investments and efforts to grow
loans since early 2015 are already having an impact. Looking forward, we expect to see strong growth in loans held for

investment and continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly
changing the overall risk profile of the company. I'd also remind you that net interest income this quarter made up only
18% of our total revenues. Even if we continue to grow our loan portfolio at the higher rates you have seen, our overall
business model will remain very spend focused, given the expected reduction in loans associated with the co-brand
relationships, which are ending this year.
Moving to our revenue performance on slide six, reported revenues were down for the full year and the quarter driven
by the prior-year Concur gain and changes in FX. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 4% during the
quarter, which is consistent with our full-year performance. Looking at our major revenue drivers, discount revenue
was down 1% during the quarter, which was relatively consistent with our full-year performance. During the quarter,
our discount rate declined by 2 basis points versus the prior year driven in part by the continued rollout of OptBlue.
Going forward, we anticipate that our discount rate will decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued
expansion of OptBlue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes, and continued competitive pressures.
Moving to our other primary revenue driver, growth in net interest income remained strong at 9%, modestly higher than
our full-year performance. Performance continues to be driven by strong loan growth.
Stepping back, while revenue growth did not accelerate sequentially as we anticipated through the year, we were still
able to consistently generate adjusted revenue growth of 4%, even in a challenging environment. Going forward,
subject to FX and economic trends, we believe that our efforts are focused in the right areas to drive acceleration in our
revenue growth rate.
Turning to credit performance on slide seven, our provision was down 2% versus the prior year, as lending write-off
rates remained at lower levels. Our write-off rates remained the lowest among large peer issuers. I'd note that the
reclassification of a portion of our loans this quarter to held-for-sale had a small impact on provision, but did not
significantly change our performance trends or reported credit metrics. Going forward, continued growth in loans will
contribute to an increase in provision, as we expected since we first provided our multi-year outlook last year. We also
expect to see some upward pressure on our write-off rates, due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new Card
Members. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic results.
Moving to expense performance on slide eight; total expenses were up 1% in the quarter and down 1% for the year, but
were influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Overall, we continued to be very disciplined
about controlling expenses, but recognize that we will need to be even more aggressive going forward, as evidenced by
the $1 billion target to reduce our overall cost base announced in today's press release.
Looking at the quarter's results, marketing and promotion expenses ramped up to $892 million, which was similar to
the prior year, as we also had an elevated level of spending during Q4 2014 due to the Concur gain. As we discussed,
another one of the key areas of focus for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving new card
acquisitions.
In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer,
small business, and corporate-issuing businesses during the current quarter, which remains well above the average level
of card acquisitions in prior periods. Now obviously, this is a very early signpost for our investments, and it will take
time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our performance.
Turning to rewards, expenses were down 5% in the current quarter, driven by $109 million impact in the prior year
related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a
significant impact on the cost of Card Member services, which was up approximately 20% versus the prior year during
both Q4 and the full year. We will have lapped this as we head into 2016.
One last item I'd highlight is the tax rate, which was 38.2% in the quarter and significantly above the full-year rate due
to the Enterprise Growth charge, majority of which was not tax-deductible. Looking forward into 2016, excluding the
impact of discrete items, we believe that our underlying tax rate will be closer to the 34% to 35% range it was trending
to prior to this quarter.

While there were a number of items that impacted year-over-year growth in operating expenses, adjusted operating
expenses were down 2% for the full year and were up 2% after adjusting for FX. Both of these results are below our
3% operating expense target, and in part reflect actions we took at the end of 2014 and throughout 2015, as we
observed that the environment was evolving.
We have a long track record of taking cost actions when needed, and looking forward, we plan to take a series of
additional aggressive actions, which we expect will result in restructuring charges during 2016 and drive benefits in
2017 and beyond.
Now shifting to our capital performance on slide 10; during the current quarter, we returned over 150% of the capital
we generated to shareholders, while maintaining our strong capital ratios. During full-year 2015, we returned over $5
billion of capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year, and continue to increase our dividend, which is now
approximately 60% higher than it was in 2011. Our full-year payout ratio of 105% reflects our confidence in the
company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, as well as our ongoing commitment to
using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now shift to a discussion of our negotiation efforts on the Costco portfolio sale and our 206 (sic) [2016]
(17:58) to 2017 financial outlook. As we mentioned in our press release and 8-K last Friday, given the progress on our
portfolio sale discussions, we are now reporting the Costco portfolio as held-for-sale in a separate line on our balance
sheet. Given this progress, and given the importance of the transaction to our 2016 outlook, we have decided to provide
a substantive update on the status of the anticipated transaction today. Clearly, since the agreement is not final, the
update is subject to change. But we believe an agreement consistent with what I'll outline will be signed in the near
future.
We now expect there to be a sale, and for that sale to close around mid-year 2016. And we expect that our merchant
acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close. In addition, as you would expect, we will continue to
hold the co-brand loans and co-brand Card Members will also be able to use their cards at any AmEx-accepting
merchants through the transaction close date. We will be paid a premium on the assets when the transaction closes. The
ultimate gain will be determined based on the assets actually sold, but we currently estimate a gain of approximately $1
billion. We have not yet signed a definitive agreement and given that we are still several months away from the close
and the Card Member borrowing and pay down trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition, the final gain
could differ from our estimate.
So now that we've concluded 2015 and progressed in our portfolio sale discussions, we can provide additional clarity
on our 2016 and 2017 EPS outlook. Because year-over-year growth rates during this period will be complicated by the
number and timing of the moving pieces in our results, we have focused on the absolute dollar amount of earnings we
are targeting in each year. That said, we have not seen volume and revenue growth accelerate, as we expected over the
past year. And the competitive, economic and regulatory environment has become more challenging. As a result, we
have become more cautious in our outlook, and now expect our earnings per share during 2016 to be between $5.40
and $5.70.
This now includes a substantial benefit from the portfolio sale gain and the incremental economics associated with the
Costco contract extension, and also includes the incremental spending on growth initiatives that they are helping fund.
This range excludes the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies. This is clearly a change in our
expectations. I can assure you, though, that we are acting with a strong sense of urgency and confidence in executing
on our plans to accelerate revenue growth and even more aggressively, reduce our cost base. To help drive revenue
growth, we plan to maintain our spending across a range of business opportunities during 2016 at similarly elevated
levels to 2015.
I emphasize that while the gain from the portfolio sale will impact us only in the quarter we close the transaction, the
increased spending on growth initiatives will occur in all four quarters, resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly
performance. On costs, as we moved through 2015 and gained more clarity on the portfolio sale, as well as our revenue
growth outlook, it became clear that we needed to accelerate and expand our cost reduction efforts to right size our cost
base with the evolving business environment. As a result, we have launched cost initiatives that are designed to remove

$1 billion from our overall cost base, which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion costs, by
the end of 2017.
To put this into perspective, since 2007, our billed business volumes have grown by over 60%, but our adjusted
operating expenses are almost flat over that period. We achieved this disciplined cost control by continuously taking
actions to increase the overall efficiency of our organization. Looking forward, we determined that those actions were
no longer enough and that we needed to be even more aggressive on eliminating costs, which is why we are targeting a
$1 billion cost reduction. We plan to take actions throughout 2016 to drive these benefits in 2017 and beyond, which
we expect to result in restructuring charges this year.
So if you step back and think about our 2016 EPS guidance versus 2015, there are several key items impacting the
year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will grow based on our financial model of revenue
growth, which we believe should accelerate from 2015 levels, along with operating expense leverage and capital
returns. Second, the portfolio sale gain will be partially used to fund a continued elevated level of spending on growth
initiatives. Last, when the Costco volumes go away at mid-year, the marginal contribution will fall away immediately,
but we will need to maintain certain costs all the way into the first quarter of 2017 to ensure strong customer service. In
addition, given the slower-than-anticipated overall revenue growth we saw in 2015, we will also need to remove more
costs to offset the lower revenue, which will take some time.
Turning to capital; the portfolio sale will increase our capital ratios due to a significant reduction in risk-weighted
assets. We plan to leverage this additional capital flexibility to support business building opportunities, including
growth in the loan portfolio and potential strategic acquisitions. As you're aware, we have been aggressive historically
in our capital requests through the CCAR process. Consistent with this approach, we plan to consider the opportunity
for incremental capital returns related to the portfolio sale as part of our 2016 CCAR submission.
Turning to 2017; we are now targeting to earn at least $5.60 per share. If you step back and think about this versus our
2016 EPS guidance, there are again several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the
underlying business will again grow based on our simple financial model of revenue growth, operating expense
leverage and capital returns. Second, we will have to lap the portfolio sale gain along with a half year of getting the
marginal contribution from the Costco business. Third, our more aggressive cost-reduction efforts will be gaining
traction, reducing our operating expense versus the 2015 adjusted base of $11.3 billion by at least 3%. And last, our
spending on growth initiatives will be lower based on the changes we are making to drive further revenue growth more
efficiently.
Looking beyond 2017, because there are so many moving pieces in the near term, it's difficult to project when we
might return to our consistent 12% to 15% earnings per share growth range. I would point out, however, that to achieve
our 2017 target of $5.60 per share, the core will have to be growing at a healthy rate, and overall, we believe the 12% to
15% EPS growth is still an appropriate long-term target for the organization. We recognize that we're operating in a
new reality and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to
believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.
Now let me turn it back over to Ken, so he can provide some additional context.
Kenneth Irvine Chenault
Thank you, Jeff. Now that Jeff has taken you through our financial outlook, let me come back to the questions I set out
at the start of the call. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? And why are we
confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long term? To give context, our performance comes against the
backdrop of changes that are reshaping the payments industry. These include a reset in co-brand economics, regulatory
and competitive pressure on merchant fees, and intense competition for customers.
A number of cyclical factors in the broader economy also weighed on our 2015 performance and influenced our
outlook for 2016 and 2017. As Jeff said, the economic headwinds we cited last year, including the stronger U.S. dollar

and lower gas prices, have lasted longer than we previously expected. This is a long list of challenges, longer than
we've seen in a number of years. We recognize them. We've been addressing them with a strong sense of urgency and
we're making progress on many fronts. Over the past 12 months to 18 months, we took decisive action in the co-brand
space, accelerating contract talks with partners. We focused on those where we can earn attractive returns and provide
strong customer value, which led us to deals with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Air and Charles Schwab. We
contained operating expenses and restructured many areas of our business. Now we're set to take cost-reduction to the
next level through our $1 billion improvement program. We ramped up spending on Card Member acquisition and
brought in 7.7 million new [audio gap] (28:29 – 28:36) cards in the U.S. last year.
Our investments here are paying off and we're now focused on turning those new accounts into additional volumes. We
stepped up investments in our international business with strong results. Adjusted billed business rose by 12% last year.
We expanded our merchant network, adding more than 1.2 million new merchants globally in the past year. With our
OptBlue program, we're continuing our efforts to move toward parity coverage with the other card networks in the U.S.
We grew our lending business faster than the market, while maintaining our industry-best credit performance.
We'll continue to target new lending prospects and deepen relationships with current customers. We expanded our
digital capabilities with new apps and partnerships to better serve our customers. We streamlined our management
structure, creating integrated consumer, commercial, and merchant teams to accelerate growth. And taking advantage
of our financial strength, we returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders last year.
Although 2015 was challenging, we did accomplish a lot. However, let me be clear. We need to accelerate our efforts
and we have a plan to do just that. It includes three priorities; accelerate revenue growth, reduce our expense base, and
optimize our investments and continue to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders. Let me start with
expenses and give you a little more context. In 2013, we set a goal to limit OpEx growth to 3% or less. We beat that
goal every year since then. To do this, we took a number of restructuring actions that provided benefits in 2015 and will
continue to aid us in 2016.
The plan we announced today is a major step up from there. It targets reducing our overall cost base by $1 billion by
the end of 2017. Along the way, we intend to see operating expenses decline by at least 3% from our 2015 base in
2017, and we expect to see the full benefit in our run rate by the beginning of 2018. This will involve restructuring
actions to streamline the company starting in the first quarter of this year. I have assigned our Vice Chairman, Steve
Squeri, to lead the effort. He'll work with me and our senior leaders in every area of our business to ensure we move
quickly and meet our goals. Steve is one of our most accomplished leaders. He's been at the forefront of containing our
operating expenses over the past several years and has an outstanding track record of making the organizations he's led
more efficient and more effective.
As this new effort advances, we'll be taking actions to reduce costs in a thoughtful way without compromising our
ability to serve our customers, meet our compliance obligations, and grow the business. We have a strong history of
meeting our reengineering commitments and I'm confident we'll do it again. At the same time, we're also focused on
optimizing our investments. We'll continue to use big data analytics to improve the way we evaluate, prioritize and
execute our investment opportunities. We'll gain efficiencies from our new management structure and we'll stop certain
initiatives where we're not seeing results or a clear path to results just as we did by refocusing Enterprise Growth.
Using our investment dollars more efficiently should help us as we move toward a lower level of investment spending
in 2017. As we work to accelerate revenues, we'll be focused on the opportunities I cited earlier. We'll invest to grow
our Card Member base and merchant network, deepen customer relationships through lending and rewards, increase
our international presence, grow our commercial payments business, and develop newer adjacent opportunities like our
loyalty coalition business. In addition to organic growth, we'll continue to explore opportunities to grow through
acquisitions. Even with the challenges we faced in 2015, we continue to see underlying growth in the business.
Adjusted revenues rose 4% for the year, and we're confident that we can improve upon this performance.
We have a tremendous set of assets to draw upon; our trusted brand, financial strength, the advantages of our closed
loop, world-class customer service and our proven ability to innovate. Our integrated payments model runs about $1
trillion in spending through our closed loop each year. That rich data enables us to create value for Card Members and

build business for our merchant partners. This is a major advantage and it's one reason why other card issuers are trying
to cobble together a closed loop of their own, despite only having a portion of the essential data.
We're not simply looking to do a better job of processing payments. We're focused on using our relationships,
technology and data to better serve our customers and open up commerce opportunities for our partners. As the
boundaries between online and off-line blur, I believe our business model puts us in a great position to benefit from the
convergence of payments and commerce. We have a deep and experienced management team to guide us forward.
They've been tested by major challenges many times over the years, and our company has always emerged stronger.
You'll hear more about our plans to drive growth from Steve Squeri, Anré Williams, and Doug Buckminster, as well as
Jeff and me during Investor Day on March 10.
Let me conclude by saying, we recognize that we're operating in a new reality. That's why we're focused on the plan I
outlined to increase revenues, reduce cost and optimize our investments. We are confident that we can deal with our
near-term challenges, return to growth and position the company for long-term success. Thank you.

Thanks, Ken. As a reminder, our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question
during the session. Therefore, before we open up lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to
just one question. Thank you for your cooperation in this process.
With that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes, Jeff, can you confirm, in terms of the 2016 guidance, do you have an incremental payout
ratio assumed in there from the gain or do you not have that built in yet?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I think, Don, it's fair to say, we take our best shot at estimating what we think a
reasonable capital return is based on our view of our capital strength and our opportunities. Of course, as you well
know, we'll have to see if the Fed agrees with us. But certainly, what we have built in is what we think is a very healthy
return on capital.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Right. And then the $1 billion of expense cuts, clearly, I mean, Costco is a big piece of the
portfolio, 20%, you'd expect some cost reduction from that. Can you sort of help us think about how much of the $1
billion is sort of Costco related versus sort of core business?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, the way I guess I would answer that, Don, and I'd remind you Costco's 20% of our
loans, and our net interest income is only about 18% of our income statement. They're about 8% of our billings for the
co-brand, another 1% for merchant, other merchant acceptance. I think the broader way to really think about it is that,
as Ken said in his remarks, we recognize that there are many things that have changed in the environment we're in. And
as we have gone through 2015, we have not seen the revenue acceleration that we had expected to see.
If you go back to our Investor Day in March, if you go back to the original conference call we did last February when
Ken and I talked about our decision to walk away from the Costco agreement, we said we're going to have to see how
much other volumes ramp up and what the pace is of that ramp and exactly what the final outcome is of when the
Costco portfolio goes away and in what away. Well we have those answers now, and when you put all of that together
with the evolving environment that we're in, we've concluded we need to be much more aggressive about all aspects of

our cost base. So I don't think, Don, you can really attribute it to any one factor. It's the confluence of all the things that
Ken and I have talked about this afternoon.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: Yeah. I would just add to what Jeff said is that, one, we recognized early that the
economics of the co-brand marketplace were changing and certainly that competitive pressures throughout the industry
were likely to increase, and that's one of the reasons, Don, that we initiated two separate restructuring initiatives in
2014, which was well before we knew how our Costco negotiations would come out, and I think those initiatives
certainly helped us to hold OpEx growth below our target again flat in 2015. Then in February, as we talked about, we
recognized that the termination of the Costco relationship was going to create a short-term volume and revenue gap,
and that's why we said it's possible that we take an additional restructuring charge.
We know what the situation is now, but that also would be based in part on the revenue and volume growth that we saw
in other parts of our business, and as Jeff said in his opening remarks, the revenue and billings growth has not
accelerated as we would have expected, and so we're working to right size the cost base, there are variable costs that we
can take out relatively quickly, but there are fixed costs as well, and that's going to take time to transition. But I think
that reengineering plan that we have put in place gives us a lot of confidence that we can realize the cost objectives that
we put in place and we can do it in a way that's not going to impair our ability, very importantly, to build on the range
of growth opportunities that we've identified.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question that will come from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Mr. Bruce, your line is open. Please check your mute key.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Great. Thank you. Good evening. Encouraging on the card acquisitions in the quarter and the
year, I guess as you're kind of looking at what is kind of the center piece of that growth, is that coming from Premium
Cards, Credit Cards, Charge Cards? Can you give us any sense as to what is kind of underlying that growth, please?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: I think, Ken, what is very pleasing to us, and this goes back to the broad range of
opportunities that we have, we clearly are pleased with the growth we're seeing in – against Premium Cards. We also
have a very good small business franchise. International, as we've said, is performing well for us. Certainly what we are
benefiting from is to have a variety of card growth initiatives. So very frankly, it is really across the board that we're
seeing this card acquisition growth, and certainly the point that we have emphasized, it's one thing to get the cards and
we're excited and think we're getting the right types of cards, but we also have a demonstrated track record of in fact
generating spending on those cards. And that's very important. But what I would say, the headline would be that we
feel very good about the growth that we're seeing across the franchise.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Great. I'll honor your request for one question. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. I guess I want to reconcile the commentary on the weaker revenue growth
trajectory into 2016 and 2017. I guess we knew kind of the co-brand reset and the regulatory backdrop, and I
understand the economic environment's a little bit weaker, but is it really mainly coming from the competitive
environment affecting the business? And maybe you could just specifically talk about what's changed over the last
three to six months that's really affecting your outlook. And then when we think about kind of strategic acquisitions,
maybe you could just talk about what you guys are anticipating in terms of size and where exactly an acquisition might
fit into the business? Thank you.

<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Sanjay, let me maybe go back and explain how things have evolved over the last year,
and then, Ken, you might want to provide a little broader context. As you think about the course of 2015, we clearly did
have an expectation that you would see a significant sequential strengthening in both volumes and revenues. And as we
went through the year, that clearly did not happen. As we thought about that, Sanjay, in the context of our forward
outlook, at some point when revenues weaken a little bit, as you know, we have a financial model that has lots of
levers, and we can pull those levers at different times.
As we got to the end of the year, though, and looked at a full-year revenue growth not being where we thought it would
be, we concluded it didn't make sense to pull the levers as hard as we would've had to pull them to get to where we had
hoped to get to in 2016 and 2017, and so we've adjusted course. So I think there's many, many drivers of that slower
revenue growth, which Ken and I tried to get at in our remarks. But, Ken, you probably want to provide a little broader
context.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: Yeah, I think what's important is while certainly, Sanjay, the revenues and the
volumes are not where we want them to be, I would just go back, if we look at the competitive environment and look at
the large issuers, we are at least generating an adjusted 4% growth rate against the backdrop of a more challenging
economic environment, and as we've continued to maintain over the last several years, an intensifying competitive
environment. What we've seen from our large issuing peers is, despite the investments they're making and the billings
growth, they're not achieving much revenue growth. So our revenue growth is certainly better. I'd like it, in fact, to be
accelerated, and we believe it will in 2015 (sic) [2016] (45:05). I think, again, the investments that we've made in card
acquisitions have, frankly, been performing, in general, in line with our expectations.
Now, we are constantly reviewing our investment alternatives and we're allocating those dollars where we believe we
can generate the best returns. And I think, as we've said, when some of those initiatives are not working, Enterprise
Growth was an example of that, what I've also been pleased with is the increasing way that we are using our technology
and our data analytics to improve our marketing programs and to make them more effective. So I think there is always
some lead time, as we've talked about, between when we make the investments and when we see the returns.
But I think it's not just the signposts that we've seen in card, in bringing in new cards, but it's also some of the signposts
that we're seeing in some of the services and capabilities that we're providing, something like Pay with Points, which
we are seeing from a standpoint of young people. There is an attraction and engagement to those programs. I think what
we've done with some of our digital partnerships, I think the progress that we've made with OptBlue, and then I go back
to what I think has been very strong performance in a range of international markets. So I think that's the balance.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Ken, I'd just kind of summarize it, if you think about 2015, Sanjay, you had oil that kept
going lower, you had FX that kept going against us, the economy was weaker than people thought, and you have the
cumulative impact of regulation and competition. All that said, as we get into 2016, for all the reasons Ken talked
about, our expectation is that we should expect to see some acceleration in our volume and revenue growth trends,
beginning in the first quarter.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Jared Maurer>: Thanks. Ken, we don't often get you on a call, so I think a long-term question seems
appropriate. Historically, AmEx has been – traded at premium to peers due to its spend-centric discount revenue-heavy
model. Now we're hearing about ramped up pressure on the discount rate and aggressive lending growth against the
backdrop of an industry quickly moving toward giving up interchange economics to drive loan growth and share gains.
So my real question's concerning the competitive backdrop and change in how your competitors are looking at their
economics, how can you maintain the model, long-term, that has traditionally allowed AmEx to be valued at a premium
to competitors?

Page 11 of 19
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: Well, I think that's, Craig, a multi-layered question, so let me hit it on some different
pathways as we go forward. I think one is, if you look at the issuing side of the business and you focus on the
spend-centric versus the lend-centric, I go back to a point that Jeff made in talking about the fourth quarter results, and
certainly we've said this in the past, if you look at net interest income as a percentage of revenues, that ranges around
15% to 20%. In the fourth quarter, it was 18%. So, at the end of the day, the progress that we're making on lending, and
I should add to that, growing better than the industry with industry-leading credit performance, and I think we're getting
good spending on those cards, I think that is working well for us, as I look at it on the issuing path.
So, I feel pretty good about the viability of our spend-centric model. The second thing that I would say is that there's a
danger of just focusing on specific customer segments and just focusing on one geography in the U.S. So what's
interesting is, when you look at small business, and I think you know this, in 2014, $4.8 trillion were spent by small
businesses, but only 10% of that was on plastic. And we are the market leader in small business. So I think that it's not
just the payment industry dynamics that we're competing with. In this case, we're competing against cash and checks,
and the fact that only 10% of $4.8 trillion is on plastic suggests there's a strong opportunity. I can do the same thing in
middle market.
Then I go to international and I look at a range of markets where the penetration against plastic is relatively low, and
we've actually achieved pretty good growth rates. So 12% in billings growth, in a number of markets we're growing
faster than the market. So I think, when you look at the breadth of our portfolio in consumer, small business, and
corporate, and the geographic and the fact that we are competing also against cash and checks, that gives me some
confidence relative to both the growth and the economics. Now I will absolutely admit, that's why I started off, there is
a reset on co-brand economics. That certainly is a challenge. But we are not overly dependent on co-brands, and we
have a range of opportunities that we are pursuing.
On the merchant side, let's be very clear. Visa and MasterCard have different models. At this point in time, those
models are working pretty well for them, but as I look at our opportunities going forward, I think there is a sea change
going on in payments and commerce. So, certainly they provide an important part of the payments process, but I think
increasingly, it's going to be very important to have direct relationships with consumers and merchants, and we think
direct relationships and the insights, the information that we have from Card Members and merchants, is going to be
even more valuable as the convergence of online and off-line commerce continues. And so building on the relationships
inherent in our integrated model provides the foundation, we think, to deliver strong value to our shareholders.
So I think that, that is going to be an important development as we go forward. What I would also say is that, when you
look at the value that we provide, and certainly regulation is playing a role in the Merchant business. But I do want to
avoid sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison between the Visa and MasterCard rate structure, which is enormously
complicated and that vary significantly by product. And I would say that our merchant rates really do reflect the value
that we provide and so the fact that, as you know, Card Member spending is 3 times to 4 times the amount on Visa and
MasterCard, I think Visa has consistently increased their prices in many cases and that obviously is a dynamic there.
But when I relate that to the importance of how we drive value going forward and direct relationships that we have with
the end-user customer and the merchant and the changes in commerce, I think that we have the ability to compete. So
you've got to look at the breadth of the portfolio and the number of levers that we have to pull.
<Q - Craig Jared Maurer>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. I guess I was struck by the comment that you expect that in 2017 the
level of marketing and rewards could be reduced as you kind of lap some of those investments. Can you talk about how
much that could be? And maybe relate the level of rewards that are on the cards that you are offering to these new
consumers to what your current kind of cost of rewards is?

<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Hi, Moshe. To be clear, rewards were not what I was referencing. What we're talking
about is when you look across the range of things we spend in the marketing and promotional area and the operating
expense area, when we look at our evolving digital acquisition, our evolving use of big data, when we look at certain
markets, Ken just talked about the breadth of our business model, in fact we're increasingly finding the use of direct
sales forces to be a more effective way to grow than certain of our more traditional marketing and promotional efforts.
We absolutely look at that from our marketing and promotional line and see a pathway to moderate down the level of
spend without losing any ability to grow revenues.
And so as we think about taking the $1 billion out of the cost base, we very consciously have said, well the majority of
that will certainly come out of operating expenses. There are instances where in fact it makes more economic sense for
us to pull down marketing and promotional expenses and actually grow operating expenses. And we want the flexibility
to do the right things to drive revenue growth going forward.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: Yes, I'd just say two or three things, Jeff, is one, what we've seen on the operating
expense side, if I just take small business and middle-market, what we've seen is the expansion of our sales force, the
return on that has been substantial, even though that adds to OpEx that is a very, very good trade-off that we want to
make. But I'd just come back on the rewards point because there are different categories of rewards. There is cash back,
there's co-brands, and the reality is, if you look at how we've managed the cost, for example, of Membership Rewards, I
think we've been able to manage those costs very well. When we look at the engagement of our customers on
Membership Rewards, it's been very strong.
So I mentioned that, that segment of 30 and under is very attracted to Pay with Points. And so the deals we have done
with Airbnb and Uber are very attractive to that segment. And one of the reasons why is because we have a program
that's over 20 years old, and in fact we have a very large number of points in our bank. So I think as with other
categories, when you look at rewards, you've got a segment and you've got to look at the economics of cash back,
you've got to look at co-brands as we've talked about. And certainly the margins have been squeezed more in
co-brands. But the fact that we have a very broad-based rewards program that we've continued to evolve, we've made
more digital, we've made more mobile, I think gives us a flexibility in how we manage the overall reward needs of our
customers.
Operator
Thank you. We'll move on to our next question. That will come from Bill Carache with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Carcache>: Thank you. Good evening, Ken and Jeff. Could you clarify for us the core EPS number,
what that is for 2016 excluding any gain net of reinvestment? And the reason for the question is that some investors
that we've spoken with are stripping out the $1 billion Costco gain or about $0.66 a share to get to kind of what they're
calling a core EPS number for 2016. The math I've seen is people are using the midpoint of your 2016 guidance to get
to about $4.89 that would imply negative 9% year-over-year growth for 2016. And they're comparing that to kind of
what you had previously been guiding to the modestly positive EPS growth, I think consensus is at plus 2%. Maybe
could you give a little bit of clarity around that just so there is not, I guess, speculation around what – how much of
2016 is being influenced or, I guess, inflated by the gain?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yes. So I think, Bill, the way to think about it is as I said in my remarks, we are – we'll
use the gain partially to remain at the more elevated level of growth-oriented spending that we were at in 2015 and in
fact, Moshe was just talking to us about in terms of how we will rationally pull it down in 2017. That is a change. If I
go back to the way we first talked about 2016 in February and March last year at our Investor Day, our assumption had
been we would begin to moderate that growth-oriented spending down in 2016. As the gain has come in, as we've
looked at all the things going on in the company, we've made the decision that the right thing to do for the long-term is
to stay at that higher level.
Now, in terms of the exact amount, I guess there's a little bit of judgment, Bill, involved in that. Certainly, a very
substantial piece of the gain is being used to keep our investments up at a higher level. Is it all the gain? Probably not.

Is it the majority of the gain? Probably. I'm hesitant to put a firm number on it because that's really not reflective of
how we run the company. We look at the range of opportunities we have that we think make sense to use our
shareholders money on for the long-term. We're funding those up very fully in 2016, and that soaks up a good portion
of the gain.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: Yeah, the point I would make, Jeff, is that American Express has had a philosophy
of how we've used gains over time, and where we see growth opportunities and those of you who've followed the
company for a while might recall that we had a fairly substantial gain over a multi-year period in the Visa/MasterCard
private action. And so the damages claim was in. I think the first amount tranche was probably $1 billion. I think it was
$3 billion in total. I can't remember it exactly. But the reality is that we believe we had a range of opportunities to
invest in growing our business. Middle-market was an example, and small business. And I think what we demonstrated
is we used those gains in a very, very productive way.
So when I look at what we can do relative to adding new Card Members, deepening customer relationships from a
lending, reward standpoint, we believe even though commercial payments had a slower year in 2015, we see that as an
area for investment going forward. So this has been pretty consistent that where we have seen opportunities either to
make investments in technology platforms or from a growth standpoint, we've done that, and I think we've had a pretty
good track record of basically achieving the outcomes that we set out to.
<Q - William Carcache>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue that will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hey. Good evening, guys. I guess two unrelated questions. Given everything that we're hearing
in the economy around corporates, particularly the industrial economy, any material weakness that you're seeing across
any sectors? And I guess specific for you, Ken, given the plan you laid out today, can you just talk about how
management incentives are aligned with delivery on the plan?
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: What I would say, Ryan, is our management incentives start with pay with
performance, and so what we have is very clear objectives around each of our businesses, whether that's consumer,
commercial, merchant, international. We obviously factor in what are some of the external factors that we need to
weigh, but we have very clear objectives that we have set for the company overall, and for particular businesses, and I
think we have a demonstrated track record that we hold our people accountable.
So what we have not had is a situation that someone simply says, that'll be – certainly will be reflected in our
compensation is because it's a challenging economic environment that people get a pass. That's not the way we operate
as a company. On the other side, there are different strategic initiatives and particular areas that we're going to make
multi-year investments in, and we establish certain signposts to judge the effectiveness and the performance of those
activities. And it is a very rigorous process that we very consistently review, not only as a management team but with
our board and the comp committee in particular on a regular basis throughout the year.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: And then just on the other part of the question around the – around what you're seeing from
corporates; any particular sectors of weakness?
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: I think, as we've said, hopefully, we believe that we'll see some improvement, but I
think we've been very clear throughout the year that I would say the segment that I've been most disappointed in has
been the corporate segment. And I think you have heard me say this before, through the years that the easiest expense
category to cut is T&E. That's the first thing you see. Then you start to see people cutting on technology investments.
And we hope that we'll see some improvements in that in 2016, but as I evaluate 2014, that was an area that in the
beginning of the year, we started off in a better place and we saw pretty consistent decline, and certainly, what we have
seen in my 30-plus years' experience with the company is cutbacks in T&E tend to be an early indicator for a

slowdown, and I'm not sure what will happen going forward, but what we do believe is we'll see some improvement in
the growth in commercial in 2016.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Thanks for taking my question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Napoli>: Thank you. Question, I guess, Jeff, you sounded pretty confident and, Ken, about accelerating
growth in 2016, starting in the first quarter. That's kind of an unusual statement in an environment where the markets
are very jittery about decelerating economic growth. What gives you confidence in seeing accelerating growth in 2016
to build it into your plan and even say that it would – you would see it in the first quarter?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I think I could maybe answer that in two parts. Something as close in as the first
quarter, Bob, you really look at just some of the things we're lapping, right? So FX, while still a headwind for us, is not
as big a headwind as you get into the first quarter. We'll see what happens with oil prices. A couple of weeks ago, I
would've told you that I think they're going to – we're going to get to a lapping point on oil prices, although those have
gotten a little bit tougher.
And then when you just look at some other things going on in our business, including Costco Canada, the areas that we
have been focused on throughout 2015 in terms of spending and the trends we're seeing, we do think that as soon as
Q1, you should see some acceleration in the volume, year-over-year volume trends that you've been seeing. As you
think more broadly across the year, I mean, certainly we worry about all the same broad macroeconomic risks and
trends that you talked about. We're just balancing that against all the other things that we're doing to try to accelerate
revenue growth and the fact that 2015 was another year of not particularly great growth and yet we still got on an
FX-adjusted basis to 4% revenue growth and we think we would do better than that in 2016.
<Q - Robert Napoli>: And are you counting on an acceleration in GDP growth to get to those numbers?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: No, of course not.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: No. No. No.
<Q - Robert Napoli>: And then you're clearly not seeing a deceleration then in pieces of your business in line with
some of the concerns, you're not seeing strong trends necessarily, but you're not seeing – you're not concerned about
the U.S. economy going into recession, for example.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: Yeah, here's what I would say, Bob, is we are not seeing decelerating trends. We're
certainly not seeing in the overall economy catalysts that would say that we think there are going to be improvements in
GDP growth, but I think the indicators that, and the reasons that Jeff cited, we're really focused on our business model
and the reasons why we think we'll see improved revenue growth. And I would keep it at that. I think as with most
people, I don't think we're of the view that we're going to see a dramatic change in the improvement in the U.S.
economy. We hope things hold, and I would say we hope certainly not predicting that things will get a little bit better,
but I certainly would not bank our plan on seeing a dramatic improvement in GDP growth. That's certainly not an
assumption at all that we are making for our plan.
<Q - Robert Napoli>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Hey. Thanks so much for taking my question. You mentioned the acquisitions as a
potential growth strategy earlier in the call, and I just wanted to see if you could give us any color on the potential areas
of focus. You also mentioned the importance of being closer to the merchant and I was wondering if you've ever looked
at the private-label space as a potential area of expansion, and getting closer to the merchants through a proprietary
closed-loop card within a merchant at this point? And then – sort of second question, just clarify, for 2017, is there any
anticipated impact in your guidance from Starwood, and also from the European interchange reduction? Is that a net
positive or negative in your view? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Very quickly, Chris, take the latter two, and then Ken you should chat about the M&A
question. Certainly in 2015 you see an impact from European deregulation because while we're not subject to the
interchange caps, the reality is as we've said for a while, it puts some downward pressure on our discount rate as we
[indiscernible] (71:47) you saw that impact in 2015. You'll see a little bit more of it in 2016, probably get – need to get
all the way to 2017 before you fully lap that, that's baked into all of our thoughts. You know, on Starwood, we'll have
to see. We think we do a great job and have a great [indiscernible] (72:05) for Starwood, we think we have a great
partnership, and I think SPG is one of the assets that Marriott is acquiring, but we'll have to see over the longer term
exactly where Marriott decides to take the two programs.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: I would just say on private label, I don't see that as an area that we're going to
pursue. I think as we've talked about there are aspects of non-card lending, both in consumer and commercial that we're
certainly taking a look at. And I think we believe that we have a range of opportunities as we look at lending. We don't
think we're getting our fair share of lends from existing customers that we have, and we see that as an opportunity. I
think that private label, you got to think through the different cycles, and as we look at the different cycles in private
lending – in private label lending, we actually think that we can have more balanced growth and have a more balanced
risk profile in the way that we are conducting our lending strategy.
I would just say, to add a little bit on Starwood and then I'll talk about how we're looking at acquisitions overall that I
would emphasize and I think it's certainly one of the reasons why Marriott made the deal is they were very, very
focused on the high-quality customer that Starwood has. SPG, which is what their co-branded card is called, is viewed
very positively. You may or may not know, when the deal was announced, there was a lot of buzz on social media from
the Starwood SPG customers saying, we really love this product. There were a lot of good things said about AmEx. I
have a lot of respect for the Marriott management and I think our job, as we've been doing, is to provide really, really
strong value. And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine. So, that's what we're going to be focused on.
On the acquisition side, the reality is, as we look at a range of different opportunities, I think the Loyalty Partner
example is a very good one. One, we see it as a very manageable acquisition, but it also plays off a number of the
capabilities, and takes advantage of the merchant relationships that we have. And what you know in the Loyalty Partner
model, that I think is quite attractive, is the merchant actually funds the reward on Loyalty Partner.
And so we're in the early stages, as you know, with the Plenti launch. We actually announced, I think it was two days
ago, that Chili's restaurant chain has come on. And part of what you want with this program, we've got Macy's, AT&T,
ExxonMobil, Nationwide, a range of companies, is you want to give people a range of redemption options where they
can buy something in one place, redeem somewhere else, and having the different need categories met is very
important. So, we're very happy to have Chili's in the Plenti program.
But I do think, as we look at the merchant side, as we look at consumer, as we look at commercial, we think there are a
range of opportunities that obviously, if we feel they're going to leverage some of the assets and capabilities, or bring
us some of the assets and capabilities, what we would look, as we looked at with Loyalty Partner is, can we
substantially improve the size and scale and the growth of those businesses? And so, that's the philosophy that we're
going to take from an acquisition standpoint.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: That's great. Fantastic color, thank you.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: All right.

Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Two related questions for guidance
for 2016. Jeff, I thought you'd said something about restructuring charges being part of the expenses embedded in the
guidance. I'm wondering if you could quantify that at all? And then also, on one of the headwinds you're facing for
2016, on the regulation side, is it all regulation like the European stuff that was just discussed, or is it also the antitrust
litigation and anti-steering rules embedded in what you put under the heading of regulation? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So the specific things on regulation, really, that we're referring to, Chris, are around the
European regulation which went into effect in early December, as well as some new rulings in Australia that will also
impact our business. So that's really the main driver there.
In terms of 2016 guidance, to be very clear, as we said in the press release, our $5.40 to $5.70 range does not include
any potential restructuring charges. I did say, and I would expect, that it is likely we will take restructuring charges in
2016. At this point, while we have lots of work streams that have been underway for a while, we're not at the point
where we can estimate those charges, and therefore give you any sense of them, which is why we didn't feel
comfortable trying to build it into any guidance. That said, you might just, if you look at history, as Ken said earlier, we
have, over the last couple of years, done a number of restructurings, and those probably give you a reasonable range to
think about.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: Okay.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: The only other point, Jeff, I would make is, obviously, I think most people are aware
of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued an order granting a temporary stay of the trial court's injunction,
and so what that means is, as long as that order remains in effect, American Express is no longer subject to the trial
court's injunction. And so that means that we are entitled to enforce the pre-injunction non-discrimination provisions.
And so we're obviously awaiting the appellate court's decision, which we don't know when will be coming out, but I
think that was an important development that occurred towards the end of the year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Ho>: Hey. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. There's obviously a lot of talk about what
premium multiple, or if that still exists, versus other card issuers. And specifically, obviously you have an advantage on
the spend-centric model, but particularly have been rewarded for an above-average growth rate versus peers. So if I
think about your 12% to 15% target through the year, is it – on an underlying basis, it's not a realistic target for 2017, or
is it? And do you plan to provide additional visibility on the underlying growth rate of earnings, maybe ex-Costco and a
lot of the moving pieces, from here through 2017?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So, David, we will do everything we can. We did choose to go to absolute levels of EPS,
because there are so many moving pieces in our results as you go through the 2015 to 2016 to 2017 timeframe, that it is
very difficult, I think, for people to make sense of just talking about growth rates. As I said in my remarks, though, if
you carefully do the math, you only get to the at least $5.60 in earnings per share that we're targeting in 2017, if you
have what I would call a very healthy core growth rate as you move from 2016 to 2017.
In 2015 alone, I would point out to you, I took people through the math, if you think about the 5% or so of EPS that the
co-brand reset cost us, which we'll lap, the FX impact of 3% to 4%, and then the $0.10 or so was about two points of
EPS growth that 2014 added, as the net gain from the Global Business Travel and Concur transactions, you end up with
a core that's growing not quite where we would think a still appropriate consistent target is of 12% to 15%, but showing
pretty good growth. And to get to that 2017 number, you're going to have to do better than that, and get the acceleration
in revenue growth that Ken and I talked about. So, to try to put a specific number on it gets, I think, very confusing, and

you start to run together, well, what's part of our $1 billion cost reduction versus normal OpEx leverage, and that's – the
combination of those things that led us to say, here's just the absolute numbers we think we can get to.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: I think, Jeff, what it does go to is really the strength, the underlying strength of the
business model, as you pointed out, relative to the performance in 2015 and, as we've talked about, what we see as the
opportunities going forward in 2016 and 2017.
<Q - David Ho>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cheryl M. Pate>: Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to sort of follow up on the revenue growth question and
spend a little bit more time on the MDR guidance, and looking for that to be a little bit more severe compression than
what we saw this year. Can you just help us think about some of the moving pieces there, in terms of relative impact? Is
it coming more from the international piece? Is it more OptBlue, as that continues to build out? And sort of on the flip
side of that, as we talk about continuing to build out the acceptance piece, is there an acceleration in time line as to
when you expect to get to parity relative to a Visa/MasterCard?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So three things, Cheryl, on my specific comment that we do expect to see more
year-over-year declines in the discount rate in 2016. The drivers are really just what you said. Number one, OptBlue, as
we continue to build it out, the cumulative impact does grow a little larger as you get into 2016. We continue to believe
that program is good for us economically, we passed the breakeven point in 2015, and we think we are making great
progress in that program.
Two, you do see a greater impact in 2016 from the regulation in Europe and its impact on merchant negotiations, as I
talked about earlier. And three, you do have some mix issues, right? So in the first half of the year, oddly enough, as we
completely finish lapping Costco in Canada that was helping our year-over-year discount rate a little bit in 2015.
As you have seen a little bit less growth in the corporate card business, that tends to be spending at a mix of merchants
that tends to be a little bit higher in terms of discount rate. And as growth in the U.S. has been a little slower than it has
been historically relative to the U.S., that also causes – puts a little bit of pressure on the discount rate from a mix
perspective. So it's all of those things that drill the comment I made about expecting a larger year-over-year discount
rate decline in 2016. And then, Ken, you might want to comment on coverage in OptBlue.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: Yeah, the point I would make is, Cheryl, I can't give you a specific timeframe, but
the farthest I'll go is to say it's several years, which certainly 10 years ago I wouldn't even come close to saying it's
several years. I think we've made some really strong progress. I've been pleased with the momentum that we've seen
with OptBlue. I just reinforce what Jeff said is the growing mix of business within the Retail and Everyday sector is
obviously very critical to the expansion of OptbBue and obviously some of the regulation that we're seeing in some of
the key international markets.
But as we've talked about before, the increased coverage also has an impact on improving the perception of coverage,
which should help our growth. Now that takes time for perception to catch up with reality. And to the earlier point that
Jeff made, if we can start to see some improvement in the corporate business, that's going to help. But we consciously
understood that with the expansion of OptBlue we were going to have a greater mix of Retail and Everyday and that's
something that we want to see because that increases the utility of our card products.

<Q - David Mark Togut>: Thank you very much. For 2016, could you please quantify the elevated spending on
growth initiatives, break it down into each of the major buckets of spending, and then walk us forward into 2017,
giving us a sense of how each of these major buckets of spending will change? And in particular, I'm wondering how
you can reduce spending on these areas, particularly given the more competitive environment you talked about, a
tougher economy, and a tougher regulatory environment? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, David, the short answer is no. I'm not going to walk you through that level of detail
because we would consider it competitively sensitive to be that precise about the areas we're targeting for opportunity.
And also because as the world changes, it's very important that we retain flexibility to react to the evolving
environment. I think I would go back to the themes I talked about earlier. What makes us believe we can moderate
spending without losing our ability to grow revenues? Well, it's our evolving use of big data, the growth and the
percentage of our new card acquisitions that comes through digital channels that are very efficient and it's through
focusing on the areas of greatest opportunity.
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: Yeah. The only point I'd make, Jeff, and I would say we're in an even better situation
because of the progress we've made on data analytics and performance marketing, but if we go back over the last 15
years, the reality is we've gone through periods of elevated spending where we saw opportunities and then we've reaped
the benefits three or four five years down the road, even when we have moved down those levels of spending. So, we
have an opportunity and we're taking advantage of it. And I would say the analytics and the capabilities that we've
developed give me confidence that we'll take advantage of those opportunities and the efficiencies that we have brought
to bear in our business over the last several years have really produced good results. So we feel that, that dynamic is
something that we can continue and we're going to continue to push very aggressively.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Arren Cyganovich>: Thanks. Just as a point of clarification on the expenses. I think in Ken's remarks, he said
that you expect operating expense to decline by at least 3% from the 2015 base. What's in – is the 2015 base just your
GAAP total, which includes, I think, around $519 million of one-time charges; just trying to get a better understanding
of that.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah, so to be very precise, think about a 2015 base of 11.3%, which takes out those
doesn't include the Q4 charge. And so as we think about the $1 billion cost target, the reality is we've done the easy
stuff. It will take us till the end of 2017 to get to a full run rate, but if you think about full-year 2017 results, we should
get at least down 3% below 2015.
<Q - Arren Cyganovich>: Thank you.
<A - Toby Willard>: So, operator, we'll take one more question.
Operator
Thank you, sir. That will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Yes, thanks. Just one quick follow-up on Starwood. Do you have any provisions in your
co-brand partnerships, whether it be a Starwood or a Delta that preclude or limit the co-brand partner's ability to dilute
the value of the points by changing and redemption options? And then just one follow-up on the guidance, what does it
contemplate in terms of FX and provisions for 2016?
<A - Kenneth Irvine Chenault>: All right. So we'll split this up. I'll do Starwood. I'll have Jeff talk about FX.
Obviously, it would be totally inappropriate for me to go into the terms of the contract. But what I would say that's very
clear is that if you have a group of customers that in fact have relied on getting very strong value for a product, the last

thing you want to do is diminish the value of the product. And as I said earlier, not just from us, but if you look at
independent card surveys, the SPG product is one of the highest-rated products from a value standpoint.
So, I think that the Marriott people are very customer centric, very smart, and I don't think they would have done this
deal if the objective was to dilute the value of products to some of their most important customers. So that would just
be my perspective. I don't have any information from them there, but I do know in some of what I have read publicly,
they have talked about their excitement about having this type of customer and the value that they put on it, and so that
would be my perspective.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: And on FX, our comments today are based on the world as it exists today. And so we
basically presume all of the increase or strength of the U.S. dollar that you've seen today, but not that it continues to get
worse. On provision, we've been very consistent in saying, we keep a continued pathway to have loan growth grow at a
good clip. Obviously, provision will grow with it. And as we continue to get the cumulative impact of a lot of really
good growth in loans, you have a different mix, more early-tenured folks, and so there's a little bit of seasoning that
will also drive the provision rates up a bit. So that's all built into the commentary we've made today.
