MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation first quarter 2014 earnings conference call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and
Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal
Good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is
ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the first quarter. I will refer to the slides that are available through the
Investors section of our website.
Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide two.
Moving to slide three, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic
growth continued at a modest pace in the first quarter, with mixed performance across the regions. The U.S. economy
grew moderately despite the adverse effects of severe winter weather conditions. China's growth rate has flattened,
while the economies of Europe and Japan improved modestly.
Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices increased, narrowing the discount to Brent, as the global marker
decreased in the quarter. Western Canadian select prices increased significantly. North American natural gas prices
were also significantly higher. Global industry refining margins were essentially flat, while chemical commodity
product margins were stronger during the quarter.

Turning now to the financial results as shown on slide four, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings were $9.1 billion or
$2.10 per share. The corporation distributed $5.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share
repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3 billion in the quarter. CapEx was $8.4
billion. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $16.2 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of
$1.1 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $5.8 billion and debt was $21.4 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on first quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased by
$900 million, from $4.9 billion to $5.8 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other
items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $16.2 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.
Uses included additions to property, plant, and equipment of $7.3 billion and shareholder distributions of $5.7 billion.
Additional financing and investing activities decreased cash by $2.3 billion, including a reduction in debt of just over
$1 billion. Yesterday the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.69 per share, a 9.5% increase from last
quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the second quarter of 2014.
Moving on to slide six and a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings of $9.1 billion
decreased by $400 million from the first quarter of 2013. Lower downstream and chemical earnings as well as higher
corporate and financing expenses were partly offset by higher upstream earnings.
In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on slide seven, earnings increased by $750 million, as higher upstream and
chemical earnings were partly offset by lower downstream earnings and higher corporate and financing expenses.
Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.
Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide eight, upstream earnings in the first
quarter were $7.8 billion, an increase of $746 million versus the first quarter of 2013. Realizations increased earnings
by $410 million, primarily driven by higher U.S. natural gas realizations. On a worldwide basis, natural gas realizations
increased $0.31 per thousand cubic feet while crude oil realizations decreased by $4.09 per barrel. Volume and mix
effects increased earnings by a net $20 million. This included a favorable liquids mix effect of about $300 million,
reflecting increased volumes in Canada, Russia, and West Africa as well as the minimal financial impact related to the
Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry. The positive liquids effect was mostly offset by lower natural gas volumes,
primarily due to warmer weather in Europe. All other items increased earnings by $320 million, mainly due to gains
related to asset sales.
Moving to slide nine, excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, oil equivalent production
decreased by 2.9% compared to the first quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 73,000 barrels per day, or
3.3%, as the ramp-up at Kearl and lower downtime in several countries more than offset price and spend impacts,
divestments, and decline. Natural gas production was down 1.2 billion cubic feet per day, primarily due to lower
weather-related demand in Europe.
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 10, upstream earnings increased $1 billion versus the fourth
quarter. Realizations had a positive impact of $540 million, as worldwide natural gas realizations increased $0.84 per
thousand cubic feet and crude realizations were essentially flat. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $650
million. This included a substantial positive liquids mix effect associated with increased volumes in Qatar, Kearl, and
West Africa, as well as a net overlift, and including the minimal financial impact related to the Abu Dhabi onshore
concession expiry. The positive volumes earnings factor also reflects higher natural gas volumes in Qatar. All other
items had a negative impact of $190 million. Lower gains related to asset management activities were partially offset
by lower operating costs.
Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $21.35 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Unit
profitability increased to $3.40 from the fourth quarter, reflecting the benefits of our broad diverse portfolio, including
leverage to North American natural gas, our strong LNG portfolio, and the strategic choices we have made on
production volumes to improve unit profitability.
Moving to slide 11, excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, volumes were up 45,000 oil
equivalent barrels per day, or about 1% sequentially. Liquids production was up 23,000 barrels per day, or 1%. Lower

downtime, increased production from West Africa projects, higher liquids volumes in Qatar, and ramp-up at Kearl
more than offset price and spend impacts, divestments, and decline. Natural gas volumes were up 129 million cubic
feet per day, reflecting higher volumes in Qatar, partly offset by lower production in the United States and Europe.
Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 12, downstream earnings for the
quarter were $813 million, down $732 million from the first quarter of 2013, mainly due to lower refining margins
across all regions. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $80 million, offset by other items for a net $70
million.
Turning to slide 13, sequentially, first quarter downstream earnings decreased by $103 million, primarily due to
unfavorable volume and mix effects, reflecting higher U.S. refining maintenance activities.
Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 14, first quarter chemical earnings were
just over $1 billion, down $90 million versus the prior-year quarter, mainly due to lower margins. Positive volume and
mix effects were offset by other items.
Moving to slide 15, sequentially, chemical earnings increased by $137 million, primarily due to higher commodity
product margins and lower expenses.
Moving next to the first quarter business highlights, beginning on slide 16, as we discussed at our March analyst
meeting, we are starting up a number of major projects that will deliver profitable volume growth. Our world-class
project execution capabilities are enabling significant progress on several of these projects.
At PNG, we continue to achieve milestones that will result in the first LNG cargo being loaded ahead of schedule. We
have completed the onshore and offshore sections of the pipeline, which transports natural gas from the Hides gas
conditioning plant up in the mountains to the LNG plant near Port Moresby. The first LNG train is now operational and
the second train is mechanically complete, with final commissioning underway. Over recent weeks, we started flowing
the first gas from Hides, and in the past few days, initiated LNG production. And we produced the first condensate and
liquids recovered through the liquefaction process. We expect the first LNG cargo delivery in the coming weeks.
These are exciting milestones for the PNG LNG project and a great achievement for our project partners, contractors,
and the people of Papua New Guinea. As we mentioned in our analyst meeting, we had to overcome a number of
challenges during the construction phase, such as very steep slopes, flooding, and lack of infrastructure. Despite these
challenges, we are starting up several months ahead of plan and delivering a project with one of the lowest costs per
MTA relative to other LNG projects being built and in close proximity to the growing Asian market. This is also an
excellent example of how ExxonMobil creates value through our leading project execution capabilities.
In Malaysia, we have started up production in the Damar gas field from the first two of a total 16 wells. The Damar
field has a projected capacity of 200 million cubic feet of gas per day and follows the Telok gas development, which
began production in 2013. These projects provide additional gas supplies to help meet Malaysia's power and industrial
needs, promote growth of the country's natural gas industry, and drive profitable volume growth for ExxonMobil.
The Hibernia southern expansion in Canada, a project that will deliver 170 million barrels of oil, is progressing per plan
and is now nearing completion. Installation of subsea infrastructure for the water injection facility has now been
completed. Three of five platform production wells have been drilled and topside modifications to the Hibernia
gravity-based structure platform are 97% complete. Startup is expected later this quarter.
At Arkutun-Dagi in Russia, we are commissioning the last few topside systems at the fabrication yard. The platform
drilling rig will be tested over the coming weeks before the 42,000-ton topside structure is loaded out later this summer.
The topside will then be floated over the gravity-based structure already installed offshore Sakhalin Island. Drilling will
then start, and first production is expected later this year.
The Banyu Urip project in Indonesia is now 87% complete. The project will deliver 450 million barrels of oil through
an onshore central processing facility, with 165,000 barrels per day of production capacity. Pipe rack construction is
complete. Equipment installation at the central processing facility is progressing, and the onshore and offshore
pipelines are installed. Conversion of the floating storage and offloading vessel is nearing completion, with major

equipment installed and commissioning ongoing. Two rigs are in operation and the first 20 wells have been drilled.
Startup is expected around year end.
The Kearl expansion project in Canada remains slightly ahead of plan and is now more than 80% complete. We
continue to ramp up production from the Kearl initial development, with 66,000 barrels per day produced during the
first quarter, up from 47,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of last year. Facility uptime performance is
improving, and we are achieving many days with production above 100,000 barrels per day.
Turning now to slide 17 for an update on our North American activities, we continue our commitment to deliver
profitable volume growth, as underscored by our efforts to increase high-margin liquids production in the Permian. We
had eight operated rigs running in the Permian in the first quarter and recently picked up two more in early April to
continue to ramp up drilling activity. Our current net production in the Permian is over 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per
day.
Through an agreement with Endeavor Energy Resources, XTO will gain substantial operating equity in approximately
34,000 gross acres in the prolific liquids-rich Wolfcamp formation. The presence of multiple stacked pay zones creates
the potential for capital-efficient horizontal development, and the proximity to XTO's ongoing Wolfcamp operations
will offer operating cost efficiencies. The agreement increases XTO's holdings in the Permian Basin to just over 1.5
million net acres, enhancing the company's significant presence in one of the major growth areas for onshore liquids
production in the United States.
Also during the quarter, we signed an agreement with American Energy – Utica, or AEU, that will enable XTO to
optimize funding of development costs in the Utica. As part of the agreement, XTO will continue to operate in a core
area of approximately 55,000 net acres in this emerging play, and AEU will fund near-term development costs to earn
acreage. This transaction is an example of an innovative solution to develop our extensive natural gas resources in the
United States in a capital-efficient manner.
Turning now to slide 18 for an update on our exploration activities, we are currently drilling a number of wildcat
prospects from our deep and diverse opportunity portfolio, primarily concentrated in established areas. Some of this
activity includes the deepwater prospects Mica Deep in the Gulf of Mexico and the Cominhos prospect in Angola
Block 32. We also continue exploration drilling in the prolific Block 2 offshore Tanzania, where somewhere between
17 TCF and 20 TCF of gas in place has already been discovered. And a recent drill stem test on the Zafarani-2 well
confirmed good reservoir quality and good connectivity in both of the reservoirs tested.
Drilling operations are also currently underway on two blocks in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.
Also, preparations are underway for near-term drilling that includes the University prospect in the Kara Sea, the
Brugdan prospect in the Faroe Islands, follow-up drilling to the successful Domino well in the Romanian Black Sea,
the Sputnik well in Gabon, and additional drilling prospects in Tanzania.
Turning now to slide 19 and an update on our chemical business, during the quarter we achieved notable investment
milestones to grow high-value product sales. For example, we progressed synthetic base stocks investments to meet
global demand growth for high-performance lubricant applications. We commissioned a new 50,000 tons per year
manufacturing facility at our Baytown, Texas complex. And construction of our expansion project in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana continued during the quarter, with startup anticipated late this year. Both projects leverage ExxonMobil's
technology leadership to meet the industry's growing demand for advanced synthetic base stocks and improved finished
lubricant performance.
We also recently approved a world-scale grassroots specialty polymers project in Singapore to produce halobutyl
rubber to support the growing tire market in the region and premium resins for use in applications such as packaging,
woodworking, and non-woven fabrics. The project builds on the feedstock advantage and integration benefits of the
recent steam cracking expansion and will allow us to meet rapidly growing demand in Asia. Construction will begin
this year and startup is planned for 2017.

In conclusion, in the first quarter, we earned $9.1 billion, increased upstream unit profitability to $21.35 per barrel,
generated $16.2 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales, invested $8.4 billion in the business, and
distributed $5.7 billion to our shareholders. ExxonMobil's strong financial and operating performance demonstrates
progress in delivering profitable growth and achieving our business objectives outlined during our analyst meeting in
March. We improved our production mix and increased upstream unit profitability. We are committed to maintaining
our capital spending discipline and generating strong operating cash flow to deliver robust shareholder distributions and
create long-term shareholder value.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: I have a couple questions on international E&P. First, both profitability and margins were
very strong and pretty much the highest they've been in several quarters, even if you normalize for the expiration in
Abu Dhabi. So my question is whether there's any additional color on the positive liquid mix effects that you talked
about a minute ago and also whether or not there were any positive effects on the gas side that might have contributed
to that result.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, let me take a look at the upstream earnings. We can look quarter versus quarter
where I mentioned, although we had a net impact of only $20 million, we did have a significant impact on liquids. That
was about $290 million, and gas was a negative $270 million on that.
When you look at the production in the first quarter, we saw some nice increases in Canada, some in Russia, West
Africa, much lower downtime, a little more in the North Sea, and those were benefits to us. And the biggest decline in
production was the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, which carried little earnings of an effect. If you were to look
at that same effect sequentially, where we noted we had a $650 million volume/mix impact, liquids was about $400
million of that and gas was about $250 million.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: So was we look at going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, similar on the liquids
side, we saw some increases in Qatar, increases in West Africa, as well Canada with the ramp-up of Kearl, and then an
offset with the decline in Abu Dhabi. On the gas side, we also saw a nice positive mix effect. Volumes, for example, in
Qatar were up. And volumes in Europe, which was mainly the lower margin volumes out of the Netherlands, were
down because of the lower demand due to the warmer weather. So in both liquids and gas, sequentially we did see a
nice uplift in earnings from the positive mix effect.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. And so on your last comment about European natural gas, most of that or all of that
decline was related to weather. Is that the way to think about it?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, the way to think about it is it was all demand-driven due to weather, with the bulk of
it again coming out of the Netherlands, where the margins are a little lower than they are on the rest of our European
sales.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Great, thanks a lot, David.

And from Wolfe Research, we'll hear from Paul Sankey.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Paul. How are you?
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Great, thank you. David, could I just ask you about your CapEx and your volumes? In the
former case, there's an enormous step down in your CapEx here of almost 30%, which takes you well below the run
rate for the year that you indicated at the analyst meeting of around $40 billion. Is there reason to believe that we're
coming in lower on CapEx for the year, or is this an anomalous Q1 that we'll see a catch-up later? And therefore, would
you stick with the $40 billion, or could we see some downside to that?
If I could follow up on volumes, David, the guidance at the meeting had been flat 2014 over 2013, allowing for all the
adjustments that needed to be made. Again, your Q1 numbers are actually tracking below that. Can we expect a
catch-up back to flat later in the year?
And the final, final part, if you could, just address Kashagan and where that sat within your volume forecasts both for
this year and longer term. Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Okay, sure, Paul. Let me hit CapEx first. Yes, we did come in at $8.4 billion. That was
down a little over $3 billion from the first quarter of last year. That was mainly due to the absence of the Celtic
acquisition in Canada. So if you take that out from last year's results, we'd be pretty much flat, maybe down just a little
bit.
As we look out across the year, the first quarter is usually lower than the rest of the quarters. We tend to ramp up across
the year, with a little extra in the back half. So I would say as we look at where we are today and looking out over the
rest of the year, the number we gave you in the analyst meeting is probably still a good one. I don't have an update.
What I will say, though, is when we look at the first quarter CapEx, it came in just about right on what we had
expected. So, so far this year things are going according to plan on CapEx.
On the volumes guidance, we said overall we'd be flat at about 4.0 million oil equivalent barrels per day year to year
ex-Abu Dhabi, about a 2% increase in liquids, about a 2% decrease in gas. As we look at the first quarter and then
across the rest of the year, those numbers still look good to us. We've got some additional ramp-up expected at Kearl
across the year. We do expect some of these other projects I mentioned come on, Papua New Guinea being one of
those. So we look at the first quarter, it looks real strong, and certainly increases or maintains our confidence in
meeting that full-year projection we shared with you in the analyst meeting.
I think the other thing that's noteworthy and I talked about it a little bit on the last question is we are seeing the impacts
we were expecting on the volume/mix as we reduced our exposure to some lower margin barrels and were able to
increase production in some of our higher margin areas, both on the liquids and gas side. And so that's coming in as we
were expecting and we talked about a little bit at the analyst meeting.
In terms of Kashagan, in the forecast for 2014 we did not have any volumes in our outlook that we showed you in
March for Kashagan for 2014.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: That's very helpful, David, and then a quick follow-up. Your product sales are up 11% year
over year quarter to quarter. In the recent past that's been a number heavily affected by asset mix. Could you just
address the scale of that jump? The 11% growth, obviously, on a company of your size looks like enormously strong oil
demand globally, any thoughts? Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let me just clarify the question. When you're saying product sales, are you talking about
our downstream sales?

<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yes, I should say, to use your language exactly, petroleum product sales. If I look worldwide,
they're up at 5.8 million barrels a day, up from a year-ago level of 5.7 million barrels a day.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, we're up a little bit. We've seen worldwide we actually had some higher demand in
the U.S., actually some pretty good demand growth there. We've seen some growth in diesel as well with exports and
actually some growth in Europe. So those are the two main areas, but a nice quarter for us operationally as well.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: I guess my question was just the extent to which it's a comparable number year over year or
whether there was any asset mix in that or whether we can just look...
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, that's pretty comparable.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Right. Okay, thanks very much.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question. Thank you.
Operator
And next we'll hear from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: David, I wonder if I could follow up on the other Doug's question on margins. Your unit margin
capture is something you've talked about periodically. In this quarter it had a fairly nice rebound. I'm just wondering if
you can walk us through any particular reasons behind that. Was it just a great operating quarter? In other words, how
sustainable could this be?
And as a follow-on to that, you're going to have about 1 million barrels of day of new production by your forecast
between now and 2017. Obviously, that's a fairly good churn in the portfolio. I'm wondering if you could just
qualitatively or quantitatively, whichever you can do, walk through the delta you see in cash margins for the newer
projects relative to the existing portfolio, please.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Let's start out with the margin and the margin capture. In addition to some of the
volume/mix items I mentioned, you actually have some fairly significant mix impacts on the realization side, which get
masked by some of the markers. So for example, if you look this quarter versus the same quarter last year, WTI is up
over $4.00. Brent's down over $4.00, but Western Canada Select was up $9.00 a barrel as a marker for the Canadian
crudes. So if you think about where we're exposed to Brent overseas, a number of production, but including the Abu
Dhabi barrels would have some tie to that; whereas in the U.S., a lot of our production, particularly in the Permian,
would be closer to a WTI spot price; and then of course, all of our volumes in Canada. So it's not just Kearl. You're
talking about Cold Lake and our other production up there. So think about it as the volumes that went up were
attracting the higher margin or the higher price marker crudes. The volumes that declined happened to be the ones that
were Brent-based. And again, a big change in those prices did not have much of an earnings impact. So you see a nice
change on both the volume/mix side as well as on the price side.
So it's back to, again, what we've been talking about in the last couple of analyst meetings, growing the liquids and
liquids-linked volumes. LNG prices were also very attractive in the quarter, and we were able to capture those by
having some increased volumes in Qatar. So I would say on a go-forward basis, this was probably more typical than
what we've seen in the past, again, given the mix changes I mentioned.
If we look at the barrels that we're going to be adding on an equivalent basis going forward, I wouldn't give any specific
cash margins on those barrels. But if you recall back at the analyst meeting, some of the discussion I think Mark Albers
provided in his comments, we did talk about that the volumes coming online were going to be generally accretive to
our average unit margin and given the fiscal regimes we would be in, in those projects, also accretive to earnings. So I

think again as we go forward over the next year or two and we start up these projects, we expect to deliver the
profitable growth that we talked about in the analyst meeting. And we certainly look forward to these projects coming
online over the next three years.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks, David. A very quick follow-up, could you give the absolute asset sale gain in the
quarter, just as a housekeeping point? And I'll leave it there.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, sure. If you look at, on an earnings basis, the absolute gain on asset sales in total was
just over $400 million, and that was all in the upstream. So the absolute – I'll just give you the numbers here because I
know there's going to be interest. In the upstream, the absolute value of the asset sales on earnings was about $400
million in the first quarter of this year. That was lower than and compared to about $800 million in the fourth quarter of
last year, and we didn't have any asset sales in the first quarter. So you've got about a $400 million positive delta
quarter over quarter and almost $400 million delta sequentially on the negative side.
The other thing I'll mention to put the first quarter asset sales into perspective, on an absolute basis, I mentioned we had
$400 million in positive. We had about $200 million of negative tax items and other reserves. So if you think about
outside the normal operations of the business, we probably had a net absolute value in the upstream of about $200
million.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: That's really helpful. Thanks a lot, David.

And from Jefferies, we'll hear from Jason Gammel.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Thank you. Hello, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hey, hello, Jason.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: David, I wanted to ask about the PNG LNG project, and congratulations to Exxon for
bringing the project on ahead of schedule. It's something that hasn't been achieved in that business in quite a while.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: I wanted to ask about the pace of ramp-up, David. You've made reference to first
commercial cargos by the end of the quarter from the first train and start of production from the second train in several
weeks. Would you expect that you could potentially be achieving full production by year-end from both trains from
that project?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: First of all, thanks for the comments on the project startup. The team is very proud of, as I
mentioned, bringing that in early and it looks like certainly within the budget that we had talked about. And so we do
look for ahead-of-plan production and cargo deliveries.
If we look out towards the end of the year, we'll certainly be ramping up both the first train and the second train. And
assuming all of that continues to go well, we would expect to see these things ramp up pretty good across the coming
months. So it's a little early for me to give you a definitive answer, but I would say it's likely that by the time we get to
the end of the year, we're going to be running at some pretty good operating rates.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Okay, great. And if I could ask a second one, David, it's obviously pretty early days just in
terms of sanctions on Russia. But have you had any effects on your ability to invest in the multiple areas where you
participate with Rosneft as a partner in Russia?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: With regards to Russia, of course, we will comply with all sanctions. But I can tell you on
the latter part of your question, all of the activities that we had originally planned for this year are underway and
proceeding as planned.

And next we'll hear from Asit Sen with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Thanks, good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Asit. How are you?
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Good, thanks. So on PNG LNG as we get closer to the start, I was wondering if you could provide
some early thoughts on some incremental operational items. First, I'm wondering if you could talk about the condensate
ratio. Second, any thoughts on train three expansion potential, and finally any thoughts on LNG contracting strategy
relative to the pricing slope and/or your spot exposure?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. On the condensate ratio, I really couldn't give you a specific number for the
expectation there. Obviously, it's a very attractive stream.
When we look at train three, we are still evaluating a number of opportunities to expand the plant. Some of those relate
to our own exploration success and other opportunities that we have on our own operated acreage as well as potential
other sources of additional gas. So that planning and looking and analyzing and discussing that process is ongoing. I
don't have a definitive outcome for you. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if you look at the plant as it sits
today, the cost per MTA in today's market is very competitive. And of course, any additional capacity would take
advantage of the existing infrastructure and even be more attractive, so we're certainly looking at that.
If you look at our contracting strategy, we entered into long-term oil index price contracts. About 95% of the
production is already sold under those contracts, customers being in Japan, China, and Taiwan. So those contracts are
locked up. And then you'll have, of course, a little bit left over for some spot sales.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Thanks, very helpful.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
And from Wells Fargo, we'll go to Roger Read.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Just to come back to the margin discussion and maybe as a better way to understand some of
the moving parts going forward, I gather the expansion of liquids, the shrinking of the gas and what that should mean
for margins as well as the addition of LNG barrels, but I was wondering. Underlying cost, can you give us any view of
what's going on there? Are we dealing with costs are going to go up but your margins go faster, costs should hold flat
while margins should improve from mix and price, maybe a little more detail on that, if you could?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: As we look at the overall profitability, as you mentioned, margins are doing better with the
mix that we talked about on both the oil and gas side.
In terms of OpEx, we're not seeing any significant upward pressure across the portfolio. If you look at that on an
absolute basis, of course, OpEx is up with startup of some of our big projects. Kearl would be a good example of that as
we progressed from the startup phase last year into lining up production and ramping up this year. You get some
benefit of that. But we did see some lower exploration expense in the first quarter of this year. As you'll recall, late last

year, in the second half we booked some fairly heavy exploration expense, mainly attributed to our business in Russia.
And that was a little lower this quarter, but as expected. So I'd say overall, if you think about the margin capture and
the profit capture, again, it's the mix that we've talked about, in particular as we ramp up these projects across the
quarter.
I think the other thing I might add is on the unconventional side, we continue to make good progress driving costs
down in the areas that we're operating. As we talked about before, the combination of ExxonMobil's technology and
XTO's operating experience, we're really starting to see the leverage we get by combining those, particularly as we
continue to acquire attractive acreage. As I mentioned, the Permian would be a good example of that. So across that
portfolio, that trend continues to be positive in terms of reducing costs and improving capital efficiency, so that part of
the business is also doing well.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay, great. Thanks. And then the follow-up question, recent headlines indicated Argentina is
going to actually be importing some crude. Obviously, you're a major mover and shaker in the Vaca Muerta shale. I
was wondering. Have you seen any indications from the Argentinean government that they're willing to be, I don't
know a good term, flexible in terms of helping to accelerate activity down there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'll take the last part of your question first. We continue to have ongoing discussions with
the government about fiscal terms and stability. And I don't have anything definitive to report on that, but those
discussions are ongoing. We have seen some positive signals out of the government recently in terms of improving
export and import conditions and what we're doing there. These are certainly positive steps that could lead to an
attractive business environment, but it's all part of progressing the programs and determining commerciality.
Obviously, there is a huge potential resource in Argentina called the Vaca Muerta. We continue to have an active
program there. I think we've got a total of six wells down. We've been drilling vertical wells prior to this year. We're
starting to drill our first operated horizontal wells. The first one is down. The second one is drilling, and we'll be getting
the third one down shortly. Again, without being specific, I can tell you that the data so far from our drilling and
delineation is encouraging, but it's still early days to determine actual commerciality. But if you get the combination of
good fiscal terms and stability and good resource development, that generally leads to a commercial resource
development for you. So we continue to actively pursue that. But again, for us it's a very large resource. We got in at a
very low entry cost, very low commitment. And so that allows us to really go about this in a disciplined manner and
really utilize some of the expertise XTO has to help us explore and delineate and appraise this resource without having
to spend a whole lot of money up front. So again, we're encouraged, and that piece of the business is moving along very
well.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Great, thank you.

And next we'll go to Faisel Khan from Citi.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning, it's Faisel from Citi.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Faisel.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thanks, David. If you could, you talked a little bit about some the increase in [ph] premium
(44:10) profitability in the upstream business. You also discussed LNG prices. Can you remind us how much of your
total LNG volumes are exposed to the spot market?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have a total global number on that. I think probably what would be more indicative
is if you look at – is if you take the U.S. aside, of course, and you look at our total LNG volumes, most of those are
going at oil index prices. But the rest of them by and large are going into the Asia-Pacific Rim. And so the spot prices
there are fairly close to the oil index prices, and so you're getting a nice benefit there. As well, the occasional cargo that
goes into Europe goes into the spot price, but those are attractive as well. So regardless of how the cargo is going,

either directly or indirectly, all – most of them, probably all but about 5% are either oil-indexed or are getting
equivalent type prices.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, I guess I was just trying to understand the commentary given that oil prices haven't
moved all that much sequentially quarter to quarter, but it sounded like that was a particularly strong point for you in
the quarter.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you. It was, and a lot of it is the mix on where these cargoes get delivered and
whether they're going to Europe or they're going to the Asia-Pacific Rim or whether you have a little higher proportion
going into your fixed contracts versus your spot. So we did see a little uplift on those prices. As you know, not all those
contracts are the same in terms of how they look back and what the formula is. But if we look across, for example, our
LNG realizations out of Qatar and you're just looking quarter on quarter this year to last year, we were up a little over
$1.00 a Kcf; so again, a nice piece of business.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: No, thanks, I appreciate that detail. And then just back to Russia for a second, I believe you
guys have some sort of asset swap arrangement with Rosneft that protects you in case some of the investments get
stranded in Russia. Can you just walk us through a little bit of that in case there are sanctions? Do you have recourse
here in the U.S. with assets that Rosneft has swapped into with you in that joint venture agreement you guys put
together?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I really can't comment on the terms and conditions of those pieces of business other than
we have the projects that we have in Russia and they farmed into some of our properties on a normal farm-in basis, just
like anybody else would. But any discussion of contractual details or commercial arrangements, I really couldn't
comment on.

And from Barclays, we'll hear from Paul Cheng.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hi, guys. How are you doing?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, Paul. How are you doing?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Very good; David, two quick questions. One, you talked about the overlift benefit in the first
quarter. Can you give us – quantify then what's the volume and also the dollar value? And also at the end of the first
quarter, whether from an inventory standpoint you are roughly balanced, still overlift, or underlift?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, if you're looking at the first quarter relative to the first quarter last year...
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Can we look relative to your production, actually?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. We're about 15 Kbd overlifted in the quarter. On an absolute basis, we're about 15
Kbd overlifted, and I'd estimate that to be worth about $100 million.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And at the end of the first quarter, are you roughly balanced at this point?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If we look at where we are just at the end of the first quarter, I think we're overlifted just a
little bit. So we're not completely in balance, but we're fairly close.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay, second question, Permian. Right now you are running at 10 rigs. Is there any insight you
can provide? What is the run rate going to look like over the next two or three years? You just added two. Should we
assume that you will continue to ramp up the program there? And also whether you can tell us the 90,000 barrel per day
production, what's the mix between base oil, condensate, NGL, and natural gas?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let me start with the first part. We are of course ramping up activity in the Permian. We're
doing it, like we always do, in a very disciplined approach. You don't want to get too far out in front of your headlights,
so we have been building that rig count over the last few quarters. I did mention the additional acreage that we picked
up in a very attractive area in the Wolfcamp. So as we move on, I would expect the trajectory to be the same, but I don't
have any specific count for you.
Again, in a lot of these areas we're still delineating. We're still appraising. We're still experimenting with how we go
about drilling and completing wells and that sort of thing. But I think directionally, given the quality of the acreage that
we have and the results we've had to date, I think it would be a reasonable expectation that we would likely grow that
rig count over the course of the year. I think that would be logical; but again, always in a manner that keeps in mind the
long-term development of these resources and not getting out too far in front and doing something that you'll regret
later. So it's all about assessing what we've got. We're very pleased with our acreage and then ramping up that
production as is appropriate and leaning towards that outlook we gave you in the analyst meeting that showed a nice
ramp between now and 2017 in total in North American liquid production. But the Permian will be a big part of that.
In terms of the split on the liquids versus NGLs versus condensates, I don't have that split for you, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: I see. Okay, thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.

And from Credit Suisse, we'll hear from Edward Westlake.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Hey, yes, good morning, David, three very quick tail-end questions. People have said –
and thanks, by the way for all the helpful color on [ph] H (51:23), LNG and well done on the execution on some of the
key projects. Some other people have shouted out a gas marketing benefit given the cold winter in the U.S. Did you
guys have something there that we should think about?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We benefited from the higher gas prices. But other than that, we certainly don't do any
trading, if that's what you were looking at. So if that was the question, let me be clear: all of our earnings uplift comes
from the production and sale of our gas. We don't do any trading.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Good. And then switching to the international chemicals, obviously 4Q was weak and
you've seen a bit of a comeback in Q1. Maybe just talk a little bit about you shouted out lower other expenses, maybe
just a bit of a shout-out on what's happening there.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. As we went from the fourth quarter into the first quarter this year, we did have some
significantly lower maintenance expense. You might recall in the fourth quarter it was pretty high. We had some
turnaround activity going on in Singapore and that's all behind us, and that's the biggest driver in that other bucket.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: So it's not a sea change in demand that you're seeing in the chemical chain globally?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I wouldn't say a sea change, but I would say that we are seeing some encouraging signs.
The integrated polyolefins chain is seeing some pickup in demand. Polyethylene sales have been good and we continue
to see some nice demand pickup there. We did also see some pickup, which was seasonal, between the fourth quarter
and the first quarter in our specialties business. But on the other hand, aromatics demand is weak, particularly in
paraxylene. So there are some offsets. But I think generally speaking, we have seen a little better demand. We've been
able to sell the increased production out of Singapore, so that part of the business is going well.
So I think as you go from fourth quarter to first quarter in the chemical business, lower maintenance as we move from
the first quarter to the second quarter. As you're probably aware, we are heading into a higher maintenance period. The
Beaumont chem plant, for example, came down in early April and is down for a couple of month turnaround, so we'll

see that impact, but a really nice first quarter operations on the chemical side. I think our capacity utilization,
particularly in North America, where of course we get a nice margin benefit, I think we were running about 2% or 3%
on capacity utilization better than industry. So that's not only good in total but on the margin those last couple of
percent really, really ring the cash register for you on those sales, so good quarter for us in the chemical business.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: And just in the cash flow statement, working capital contribution in the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: The working capital contribution, as I recall, was just under $2 billion, about $1.8 billion,
and that was just a change in payables.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Right.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Not a real big effect if you think about total cash flows, a number less than $2 billion in a
quarter, but it was payables driven.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: And then one bigger picture question. We always talk about shale, but obviously you've
been doing a lot of offshore exploration as well. When do you think you'll get a point to where you can update us in
terms of actually getting after developing some of these deepwater fields that you've got in the portfolio?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I think as soon as we have a little better indication exactly on what we've got in some of
these areas. One that I can mention is Tanzania, where we've had significant success. And planning is underway as we
speak, not only with our partner in Block 2, Statoil, but also with BG and Ophir broadly across Tanzania. So we're
working at evaluating potential sites for an LNG facility, and we have made a recommendation to the government. And
studies are progressing to really determine what would be the optimum development plan for our block and across that
area. So I would say all of that is progressing as you would expect for a resource of that size. But I couldn't give you a
definitive development plan or timing yet.
Julia is another deepwater project that's well underway, and we'll start drilling there this year. We've got more drilling
to do in Romania, where we've had a very nice successful initial well there. So a lot going on in some very attractive
areas, but probably still just a little early to be talking definitive development plans or startups or FIDs or that sort of
thing.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Thank you.
Operator
And next from Morgan Stanley, we'll hear from Evan Calio.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hi, good afternoon, David, more housekeeping from me here. Exploration expense is much lower
in the quarter. It was $338 million versus normal. Is that just a timing event, or is there any exploration spend trending
lower there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I wouldn't say there's any lower trend. It's really particularly, if you look quarter on quarter,
it was really just timing of expenditures, particularly in Russia and some other areas. But the program remains on track,
on schedule, and I think you'll probably see a little more normalized trend as we go out into the year.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. On the asset sale gain, you gave us color earlier that's included in income. Was that in
international upstream?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, that was in international upstream.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Got it. And maybe just lastly for me, with cash builds equaling asset sales here in the quarter, what
was the consideration to holding the buyback flat sequentially? And then what do you need to see, do you think, to
raise it? Thank you.

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I wouldn't – no change in our strategy with regard to shareholder distributions in general.
You saw we've had a nice 9.5% bump in the dividend this quarter, continuing a nice trend that you've seen the last few
years. So growing that dividend and making sure it's reliable and consistent continues to be at the top of the list for
shareholder distributions. The buyback continues to be after that with the cash we have. And although we do look at it
on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we are always taking into account cash flow projections and business and that sort of
thing; so again, on a company our size plus or minus $1 billion, not a big number.
I do think that it's noteworthy. If you look at free cash flow, for example, in the quarter, particularly relative to the last
few quarters, we did generate a total of $16 billion. We put a bunch of that into the business, funded both the dividend
and the buyback and still had $2 billion left over. Half we paid down debt and half we increased cash. So again, if
you're looking sequentially across the last few quarters, a very strong quarter in cash flow consistent with a strong
quarter in earnings.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Got it, David, thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.
Operator
And from Raymond James, we'll go to Pavel Molchanov.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for taking the question, one more on the cash allocation. By my math, this will be
the first quarter that your dividend payout of $3 billion equals your share buyback. Is that deliberate, and do you see the
two lines continuing to cross that way?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I would say that was a coincidence. There's no deliberate effort to match those up or
change any pay ratios or that sort of thing.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. And then this may be most relevant for your German acreage. But in the context of
the Ukrainian crisis and a lot of rhetoric in Europe about ramping up shale development, any sense that permitting in
Germany or elsewhere in Europe is starting to open up?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have any indication of that. There is a lot of discussion going on, as we're all well
aware, but nothing definitive, nothing different than what's been going on. As you know, we have a very attractive
acreage position in Germany, and we've been in discussions with the regulators for a while on the potential of that
resource. And those type of discussions are ongoing, but nothing specific to report on today.

We have one question left in the queue, and that will come from Peter Hutton from RBC.
<Q - Peter W. Hutton>: Good afternoon, And just two quick follow-ups. Kashagan, you said no volumes had been
expected anyway in 2014, but I wonder whether you can say what you had in your plans for 2015 and what those still
are.
Also, on the upside you talking about Tanzania, it's actually been quite some time since the recommendation has gone
in about the location of the plant facility. Still, nothing has come out. Do we have a timing about when we might get
that as the next catalyst in that area?
And then finally, the downstream, if you could say some words on the international downstream, that was slightly
lower than a number of people had expected, profitability levels back to early 2009. One of your competitors took a big

impairment on their refining assets in Asia, and they are being very clear about the weakness, structural weakness in
that market. Is that something that you're seeing reflected and expect to continue out into the medium and long term as
well? Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let me take those in order here. In Kashagan, as I mentioned in the outlook we showed in
March, we did not have any volumes for 2014. We do have some volumes in 2015. I don't want to give a specific
number here today. But we did assume some production volumes in 2015.
In Tanzania, we don't have any final determination on the site, but I will tell you the discussions are ongoing and going
well, nothing out of the ordinary. And the plans for that are progressing at an appropriate pace. So I think all is well
there.
<Q - Peter W. Hutton>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: When we look at the downstream on the international side, yes, you did see some weak
earnings there overall. We had a positive impact in Canada, if you saw the IOL results out this morning, very nice
business there. We're running, obviously, advantaged crudes into those refineries, and that piece of business is going
well.
Outside of Canada, the rest, particularly in Europe and Asia-Pac, were weak. The biggest driver there is the margin.
You had some surplus refining capacity come online in that area of the world the last couple years. And the demand is
a little weak, so you've got some capacity expansion in excess of demand growth, so you do see some weakness there.
We are doing a number of things to improve our profitability there and improve our competitiveness. We've been
spending some time on logistics and expanding feedstock flexibility, working to increase exposure to high-value
product yields and less exposure to lower-margin products. We're continuing to work on operating expense and
maximizing the logistics benefits we get both from the location of our refineries, particularly in Europe, but also that
integration, full integration with the chemical business and the lubes business, which is doing quite well.
So I think if you look at that business, it's weak. It's been weak for a little while. These are always cyclical businesses
both in Europe and in the U.S. and in the Asia-Pacific Rim. So you wouldn't want to take current results and draw a
long-term trend. So we're doing what we can, controlling what we can control. And really, it's about making sure your
refineries and your chem plants, for that matter, in any region are the most competitive in that region. And then that's
what benefits you over the long term.
When you talk about a potential impairment, we follow U.S. GAAP with regard to impairment, and we look at that as
appropriate. But from our perspective, and it's different from companies that follow IFRS accounting rules, when we
look at U.S. GAAP accounting, we don't see any exposure to that in that part of the world.
<Q - Peter W. Hutton>: Very clear, thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: One of the things you might recall, just quickly, when you look across both the
downstream and the chemical segment, bear in mind the significant advantage we have on an ROCE basis over the rest
of the industry. So when you look at the denominator, when you look at the capital employed in our business both on
the chemical side and on the downstream side, our capital employed tends to be an order of magnitude lower than the
others, so that helps generate the ROCEs but also gives you a feel for how much capital is on the books.
And then the other thing we benefit from is the level of integration we have. So even as refining cycles one way and
chemical is another one, you get some offsets. And when they're both on an upswing, that's when you see the benefit of
that integration. So across the business, we continue to do well. We continue to generate the highest returns in the
business, and we don't have any long-term concerns.
<Q - Peter W. Hutton>: Okay, thanks very much, very clear.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: All right, thank you very much.
