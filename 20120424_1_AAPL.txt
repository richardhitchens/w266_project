Peter Oppenheimer
Thank you, Nancy. We are very pleased to report the results of our outstanding second fiscal quarter. We established
new March quarter records for iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, leading to our highest March quarter revenue and earnings
ever. Revenues for the quarter was $39.2 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 59%. That's a new record for
our March quarter and is second only to the all-time record revenue we reported in the most recent December quarter.
The year-over-year increase in March quarter revenues was fueled primary by very strong growth in iPhone and iPad
sales. Operating margin was $15.4 billion, representing 39.3% of revenue. Net income was $11.6 billion, increasing
94% over the prior March quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of $12.30.
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established new March
quarter records for both desktops and portables, combining for a total of 4 million Macs sold. This represents growth of
7% year-over-year, compared to IDC's latest published forecast of 2% growth for the global personal computer market
in the March quarter. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory,
which is below our target range of four to five weeks.
In February, we released a developed preview of Mountain Lion, the 9th major release of Mac OS 10. Mountain Lion
will bring popular apps and features from iPad to the Mac, including messages, notes, reminders, Game Center,
Notification Center, Share Sheets, Twitter integration and AirPlay: Mary. We expect Mountain Lion to be available
from the Mac App Store in late summer this year.
Moving to our music products, we sold 7.7 million iPods, compared to 9 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod
sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod Touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share
of the U.S. market for MP3 players remained at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD and iPod
continued to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. We
ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.
The iTunes Store generated all-time record results with revenue of almost $1.9 billion in the March quarter, an increase
of 35% year-over-year, thanks to continued strong sales of music, video and apps. We now have a catalog of over 28
million songs and 45,000 movies.
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to sell 35.1 million iPhones, compared to 18.6 million in the previous
March quarter. That represents 88% year-over-year growth compared to 42% growth for the smartphone market overall
in the March quarter based on the latest published estimate from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales growth
in all of our segments, led by our Asia Pacific and Japan segments where sales more than doubled year-over-year. We
continued to see great tremendous momentum in greater China where iPhone sales were five times the level of the
year-ago quarter, aided by the launch of the iPhone 4S in China in January and the addition of China Telecom as an
iPhone carrier in March.
iPhone 4S is now available in over 100 countries and is sold through over 230 carriers. We ended the quarter with
about 8.6 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 2.6 million units, which placed us within
our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and
accessories sales was $22.7 billion during the quarter, compared to $12.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of
85%.
iPhone momentum in the enterprise has evolved beyond e-mail, calendar and contacts. IT and business line managers
across industries see the opportunity to leverage both company and employee-owned devices to improve productivity
and efficiencies through iOS in-house app development. In fact, the majority of the Fortune 500 companies who have
approved iPhone on their networks are members of the iOS member developer enterprise program and are actively
deploying in-house applications to their employee base.

Turning to iPad, we were very pleased with sales of 11.8 million iPads during the March quarter, compared to 4.7
million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 151%. Customers are loving the new iPad with its stunning Retina
display, A5X chip with quad core graphics and the 5-megapixel iSight camera. The new iPad is now available in over
40 countries, and we saw very strong growth in iPad sales around the world, with sales more than doubling in each of
our segments. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $6.6 billion
compared to $2.8 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 132%.
We ended the quarter with about 2 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential decrease of about 300,000 units,
which placed us below our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory.
The education market's interest in iPad continues to grow. In the March quarter, we sold more than two iPads for every
Mac to our U.S. K-12 customers while also generating a record quarter for Mac sales. The San Diego school district
purchased 10,000 iPads in the March quarter and plans to purchase over 15,000 more in the June quarter for middle
school and high school programs. iPad continues to open doors to new customers with whom Apple previously had no
relationship. As we enter the K-12 institution buying season, we're hopeful that iPad will be a popular choice.
iPad's momentum in business and government also continues to build. The United States Air Force, Air Mobility
Command is deploying thousands of iPads to serve as electronic flight bags, storing technical publications and
operations information for flight crew members and trainers. Companies such as Bechtel and Balfour Beatty are using
iPads in the field for project management and viewing blueprints and thousands of iPads are being deployed as mobile
sales tools by companies such as Roche, Amgen, Bayer and Daiichi Sankyo.
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 365 million cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 15
million in the March quarter. The iOS ecosystem continues to expand and thrive with stores in more than 120 countries.
The App Store now offers more than 600,000 apps, including over 200,000 apps specifically for iPad. We were very
excited to announce the download of the 25th billionth app in March, less than four years after the launch of the App
Store. And iCloud is off to an incredible start, currently with more than 125 million customers signed up since its
launch in October.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also generated record March quarter results. Revenue was $4.4
billion, an increase of 38% over the year-ago quarter and was second only to their record quarterly revenue generated in
the December quarter. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in iPad and iPhone sales and they sold
826,000 Macs, compared to 797,000 in the year-ago quarter. And about half of the Macs sold in our stores during the
March quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.
We opened two new stores in the quarter, including our first Netherlands store in Amsterdam and a beautiful new store
in Houston. We exited the quarter with 363 stores, nearly a third of which are outside the United States. With an
average of 361 stores open, average revenue per store was $12.2 million, compared to $9.9 million in the year-ago
quarter, an increase of 23%.
Segment margin reached a new March quarter record of over $1.1 billion, which was 26.1% of retail revenue. We
welcomed 85 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 71 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an
increase of 19%. That translates to an average of 18,000 visitors per store per week.
Total company gross margin was 47.4%, which was 540 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this
difference was driven by lower than expected commodity and other costs, about a quarter was due to stronger than
expected revenue and product mix, including 35 million iPhones, and the remainder was due to some one-time items
that we don't expect to recur in the June quarter. Operating expenses were $3.2 billion and included $361 million in
stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $148 million.
Turning to cash, our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $110.2 billion at the end of the
March quarter, compared to $97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $12.6 billion and
about $74 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the March quarter. Cash flow from operations was $14 billion.
As we indicated last month, subject to board declaration, we expect to announce a dividend of $2.55 per share when we
report our third quarter results in July and we will provide information on the record and payment dates at that time.

As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking
information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 billion, compared to
$28.6 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 41.5%, reflecting approximately $70
million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.3 billion, including about $385
million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $175 million, and we expect the tax rate to
be about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.68.
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record March quarter performance, with earnings nearly doubling
year-over-year. The new iPad is off to a tremendous start, and is our fastest iPad rollout ever. We're thrilled with the
global success of the iPhone 4S, which is now available in more than 100 countries, including China. We remain very
confident in our strategy, and we're very excited about the fabulous new products in our pipeline.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton
Thank you, Peter, and we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up, please. Operator, may we have
the first question?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: As it relates to the June quarter revenue guidance, it implies a sequential downtick that is worse
than the guidance message you provided over the last three years, so can you just talk about some of the headwinds
sequentially you see on the top line in the June quarter relative to March?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure, Katy. It's Peter. The manufacturing ramps for the iPhone 4S and the new iPad were
extremely successful for us. They yielded the highest launch supply and the fastest country rollouts for these product
families that we've ever had. As a result, we were able to fulfill demand in the March quarter rather than the June
quarter this year and that generated revenue of over $39 billion. Therefore, unlike last year, we expect a sequential
decline in revenue this year. I'd highlight five primary factors that have influenced our thinking.
The first, the iPhone channel inventory changes, as I discussed in my prepared remarks, we increased our iPhone
channel inventory by about 2.6 million units in the March quarter this year, and we exited within our target inventory
range of about four to six weeks. Last year, we continued to add new countries into the June quarter and we built an
additional 700,000 units of iPhone channel inventory last year in the June quarter. So the combination of these channel
builds in the March quarter of this year and the June quarter of last year will impact the sequential comparisons from
this year to last.
The second factor: fabulous iPhone 4S execution. As we told you in January, we exited December with significant
iPhone 4S backlog, which led to a huge January. We launched China and 20 other countries also in January, which
completed the rollout of the iPhone 4S into all the countries where iPhone is currently shipping and as I said before, we
exited the quarter within supply and demand balance.
The third factor: our new iPad execution was also fabulous. We had an incredible start with the new iPad. We launched
with significant supply leading to sales of 3 million units in the first couple of days, which was also the fastest country
rollout ever. We therefore were able to satisfy much more of the demand for the new iPad in the March quarter this
year compared to the iPad 2 in the March quarter last year. This resulted in a shift of iPad volume into March this year
versus last, and it will also affect the sequential compares this year to the last.

Fourth: we decreased the entry price of the entry iPads to $399 and finally, the last factor to point out, the U.S. dollar
has strengthened recently and we expect this to have an impact on the sequential compare, especially versus last year
when the dollar weakened against most currencies over the comparable time periods.
Look, we just reported the most amazing March quarter Apple has ever had. We feel very, very good about our
business and our new product pipeline.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Just as a quick follow up to number four, the decrease in iPad price. You already saw a 7%
sequential decline in March, which suggested the uptake of the lower price iPad 2 was pretty phenomenal in March. Is
that the right way to read it? And what does that demand tell you about the potential to move to lower price points on
the iPad over time and see significant incremental demand?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Well, Katy, we're just learning about the elasticity of demand and the $399 price point. It's
doing well. But I have to tell you the new iPad is on fire and we're selling them as fast as we can make them. So we'll
learn more over this quarter, especially as we get through the education buying season which looks terrific for us,
especially on the iPad.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Congrats on the quarter.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Thanks.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Citigroup, we'll go to Richard Gardner.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Thanks. I recognize that you outgrew the market in Macs yet again, but I did want to get
your views on the slowdown in year-over-year growth rate within the category? And what factors you would attribute
that to? Are we – is it product transition related, where the inventory's down quarter-over-quarter? iPad
cannibalization? Any other color that you can provide would be helpful? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, Rich, it's Tim. As you said, we did outgrow the market, Macs were up 7% where the
market grew about 2% and so this is the 24th straight quarter that we've outgrown the market, so we're extremely
pleased with that.
The compare to last year is largely affected by the fact that we changed the bulk of our portable line or the MacBook
Pros in the February timeframe of 2011 and so it's a very tough compare. Specifically the portables last year were up
53% year-on-year and obviously – so that compare was very difficult. If you look at it sequentially, you also have to
factor in that we had 14 weeks in the December quarter and so the 26% year-over-year growth in the December quarter
is probably more like 17% when you factor out that 14th week. And so, yes, I think there was some cannibalization
from iPad and the market did slow, but the much, much larger factor – and in fact, it might be the vast majority of the
difference is the compare to a year ago.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Rich. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
We'll go to – one moment. We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could talk more broadly just about what you
might be learning about lower price points on both the iPhone and iPad? I know it was asked earlier, but was the
decrease in iPad price exclusively mix-related or is it a further broadening of your channel to indirect partners? But

more broadly, Tim, maybe you could talk about elasticity, what you're learning about customer preferences for lower
priced offerings on both the iPhone and iPad. And I do have a follow-up, please.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Sure. Toni, on the iPad 2, with the change in the entry price to $399, we're actually thrilled
with the results that we've seen, although, as Peter said, it's only been a few weeks and so it's too early to come to a
clear conclusion. But from what we are seeing, this unlocked some education demand that is probably a more
price-sensitive customer. Also in several other countries there was a marked change in demand at that price point. And
so on the early going we feel great about it. But I'd also point out that the new iPad is, was supply constrained last
quarter for the full three weeks or so, the shipping and is actually still constrained. And so the mix of the new iPad to
the iPad 2, we're not certain of what that is yet. But we are certain with what we've seen so far that the absolute sales of
iPad 2, at least in the early going, is very exciting.
On the iPhone, we continue to be very happy with the moves that we made in pricing just a few months ago on the
iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4 and both of them contributed to our ability to achieve $35 million in sales which is our
second highest quarter of all time.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: As a second question, I was wondering if you can talk about how you think about the
markets for tablet and PC devices going forward. I think you've been fairly clear about saying that you believe that
tablets will eclipse PCs in volume at some point, and I think you've also said they are somewhat discrete markets.
There seems to be a lot of work, particularly on PC-based platforms, towards trying to combine the PC and tablet
experience going forward, in part, because Windows 8 is a touch-based operating system as well. Can you comment
about why you don't believe the PC or the ultrabook and tablet markets or your MacBook Air and tablet markets won't
converge? Isn't it realistic to think in a couple of years we're going to have a device that's under two pounds with great
battery life that we can all carry around and open as a notebook or close up in a clever way and use as tablet? Can you
comment on why you don't think that product might not come or why you believe these markets are separate?
<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: I think, Toni, anything can be forced to converge. But the problem is, the products are about
trade-offs, and you begin to make trade-offs to the point where what you have left at the end of the day doesn't please
anyone. You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the
user.
And so our view is that the tablet market is huge. And you know, we've said that since day one. We didn't wait until we
had a lot of results. We were using them here, and it was already clear to us that there was so much you could do and
that the reasons that people would use those would be so broad. And that's precisely what we've seen. The iPad has
taken off, not only in consumer in a meaningful way, but in education and in enterprise and it's sort of everywhere you
look now. And the applications are so easy to make very meaningful for someone, and there's such an abundance of
those that as the ecosystem gets better and better and as we continue to double down on making great products, I think
that the limit here is nowhere in sight.
We've now – or through last quarter, I should say, which is just two years after we shipped the initial iPad, we've sold
67 million. And to put that into context, it took us 24 years to sell that many Macs, and five years for that many iPods,
and over three years for that many iPhones. And we were extremely happy with the trajectory on all of those products.
So I think iPad, it's a profound product. The breadth of it is incredible, and the appeal of it is universal, and so I could
not be happier with being in the market and the level at which we're innovating in both the product and the ecosystem
here is incredible.
Now in terms of the market itself, IDC and Gartner and Forrester have some numbers out there. I think Gartner is
saying there's somewhere around 325 million or so by 2015. Forrester is 375 million, somewhere around there. And so
basically they're in the mid-300 millions, which is about where the PC market is today. And 2015 is only three years
from now. And so I think even the more formal predictors outside of us are beginning to see these lines cross, and so I
strongly believe that they will.
Now having said that, I also believe that there is a very good market for the MacBook Air, and we continue to innovate
in that product. But I do think that it appeals to someone that has a little bit different requirements. And you wouldn't

want to put these things together because you wind up compromising in both and not pleasing either user. Some people
will prefer to own both. And that's great too. But I think to make the compromises of convergence, we're not going to
that party. Others might. Others might, from a defensive point of view, particularly. But we're going to play in both.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
We'll go to Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. Tim, there's been quite a bit of concern both in the press and within the
investment community around carrier subsidies. And I think the concerns are generally two-fold. First, that carriers will
attempt to stretch out the replacement cycle, and second, that over time, carriers across the globe will attempt to reduce
subsidies significantly. How do you think about this risk? And do you think there are factors that could pressure
subsidies going forward, and how would that impact Apple?
<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: Bill, our focus is on making the very best smartphone in the world. And a phone that delivers
a just off-the-charts user experience that customers want to use every day of their lives. And at the end of the day, I
think that carriers, the vast majority of carriers or maybe even all carriers, want to provide what their customers want to
buy. And that's what they're motivated for. And so the most important thing by far, is for Apple to continue making
great products that customers want and we are deeply committed to doing this and are innovating at a rate and pace
that's unbelievable in this area.
From the carrier's perspective, I think it's important to remember that the subsidy is not large relative to the sum of the
monthly payments across a 24-month contract period. And any delta between iPhone and maybe another phone is an
even smaller level of difference. And the iPhone has some distinct advantages for the carrier over competing
smartphones. For example, many of the carrier executives have told me the churn from iPhone customers is the lowest
of any phone they sell in their whole – in all of the phones they carry and that has a significant direct financial benefit
to the carrier.
Also, our engineering teams work extremely hard to be efficient with data and – differently than some others and we
believe that as a result of this, that iPhone has far better data efficiency, compared to other smartphones that are using
sort of an app rich ecosystem.
Finally, we think that, and this is most important, is that iPhone is the best smartphone on the planet to entice a
customer who is currently using a traditional mobile phone to upgrade to a smartphone. This is, by far, the largest
opportunity for Apple, for our carrier partners and is a great, fantastic experience for the customer, so there's a
win-win-win there. And so I think all of these factors are – some of these factors are missed in this general discussion
of subsidy.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: That's helpful. Thank you. I have one more follow-up question, if I could. I appreciate the user
stats you gave us on iCloud. Can you give us any color, now that it's been out for a few months, on how consumers are
actually using iCloud? And in particular, are you seeing a big uptake in iTunes Match and paid storage additions? And
how should we think about that?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Bill, it's Peter. Customers are using all the features of iCloud. Response has been terrific.
Feedback has been terrific. Pickup on storage is occurring but it's growing because we've just launched iCloud in
October and we've now got over 125 million users that have come on to the service since then and they're building up

Our real desire here was not about selling more storage. We think Match is a great product and we recommend that
everybody use it, but it's a paid for service. We just really wanted to increase the customer delight from the entire
ecosystem and platform of our iOS devices and the Mac and that's why we've done iCloud. And we just couldn't be

From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Good afternoon. I'll add my congratulations. If you could dig a little bit more into what's
going on in China? I know you gave some high level numbers, but is it increased distribution points? Is it just price
elasticity of lower priced 3GS? Is it more people in China having money, all of the above? Anything that you can tell
us to explain this vertical growth?
<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, Gene, it was an incredible quarter in China. The revenue was a record at $7.9 billion
in greater China, which is up over three times year-over-year and brings the first half revenue for greater China to $12.4
billion. That compares to a full year last year of $13.3 billion, so it's – it is mind-boggling that we could do this well.
Part of this was the pent up demand for iPhone 4S. As you know, we launched on mainland China in January of this
year and so China was not able to get into the Q1 period, so all of that is in Q2.
We also have very strong demand for iPad 2. We have not shipped in mainland China yet, the new iPad, although we
are shipping in Hong Kong. And so it's a combination of these things and the halo that both of these products have
produced for the Mac is also incredible. Mac was up over 60% year-over-year and that compares to a market rate of
growth of about 6%. We have expanded point of sales. On a year-over-year basis, Mac is up 70%, but still only 1,800
for all of greater China and so there's obviously a lot more opportunity there. iPhone were up over 11,000, which is
138%, but 11,000 is a much smaller number than we have in the U.S. and obviously China will, in the next few years,
be a bigger opportunity. iPad is only in 2,500 points of sale and so yes, we've expanded, we've expanded a lot, however
there is a lot of head room here in our view.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Was the iPhone mix in China different than the rest of the world? Or how was it different?
<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: I don't have that in front of me, but my recollection is that it wasn't materially different, but
keep in mind that iPhone 4S just launched in – within the quarter and so usually when a new product launches within
the quarter, you would expect it to mix fairly much toward the new product.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: And just one final quick question on the iTunes content, it seems that there's kind of this log
jam to getting more TV shows and movies and the rentals and it's been a little bit of a slow pace of improvement. How
important is getting better content on iTunes? And what's going to break that log jam?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Gene, it's Peter. We're actually thrilled with the rate that we're adding content into iTunes.
This is something that we have to do country by country so it takes a bit of time to put in place. We have the largest
catalog of songs and movies available anywhere, over 28 million songs and this led to almost $1.9 billion of revenue in
the March quarter, which was up 35% year-over-year. So we're thrilled with the progress that we're making in iTunes
and customers love it.

couple of quarters and potential constraints even at year end for some pretty neat products that you might be good for
you to have in some products down the road. I know you don't comment on future products, but this is a big concern
and I guess, can you just talk directionally about whether you expect long term to get more than your fair share of
product and what you need? And do you see any bottlenecks on the horizon that are major in that department or any
component, down the line over the long-term?
<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: Tough question to answer, Ben. Obviously we're aware of the lithography transition issue
that you mentioned with 28-nanometer. We currently do not use 28-nanometer parts. But as you also know, we don't
comment about future products and so I can't talk about the future part. Generally outside of this, we work very closely
with our supplier partners and do everything that we can do to get supply and sometimes we're successful with that and
sometimes we're not. And so you can bet that we are focused on anything that we think may impact us and trying to
push every button within our disposal to work on it.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. Well, I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is regarding Wal-Mart. They
were actually just in our building at a conference here talking about how they're moving from one store in Arkansas
now to 25 stores, and they seem really pleased with the store within a store concept. How's it going? And when can you
be in all 10,000 stores?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: There's no plan to be in 10,000 and so we're trying some things and, as you know, that
doesn't include the Mac, and so we're trying some things and seeing how it goes. And they've been a very good partner
for us on iPod and have been selling iPods for a while and are an increasingly more substantial partner in the iPad space
as well and an evolving partner on iPhones. And so you know, we're working with them and enjoy working with them
and hope to continue expanding.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. Thank you very much, Tim.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yep.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
That will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you very much. Tim, for you, I think, could you add some more specifics on
iPhones in Asia Pacific including China? Is supply demand in balance there or can that be a help? And then more
broadly, with iPhones getting increased inventory of 2.6 million units, will that in fact go down in the June quarter? Are
there any comments you could provide there? And then I have a follow-up, please. Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, let me start with your last question. On the 2.6 million, our desire, just to be very clear
on this, our desire was to increase inventory, channel inventory, across the quarter.
As you might recall, we ended with only 6 million units in the channel coming out of December because we were
extremely backlogged. And this is on particularly on 4S specifically. Our target is to be between four and six. The
addition of the 2.6 million allowed us to get within that range by the end of the quarter. And so we feel that we exited
the quarter at supply and demand balance. Because our execution, the ops team was so good, the vast majority of
supply demand in the different countries was reached by the end of January. And so we had the mother of all Januarys
with really getting out of the vast majority of the iPhone 4S backlog and launching China as well. And so it was an
incredible, incredible start of the quarter for us. Your other question was...?
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: On China specifically, it sounds like China can still be a help, or it sounds like China is still
supply demand imbalance, but I wanted to see if you could add some color there in terms of iPhones?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: China is not supply demand imbalanced on iPhones. On iPads worldwide we're supply
constrained on the new iPad, both coming out of last quarter and to give you a current view, we're still supply

constrained on the new iPad.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Got it.
<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: Demand has been incredibly robust and we are selling them as fast as we can make them, as
Peter mentioned earlier.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: In China, I believe on a macro basis, China has an enormous number of people moving into
higher income groups, middle class, if you will. And this is creating a demand for goods, not just Apple's but other
company's goods as well, and so I think there's a tremendous opportunity for companies that understand China, and
we're doing everything that we can to understand it and serve the market as good as we can.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: It certainly seems so. Tim, for my follow up, from Bill Shope's question, there have been
some changes in Spain, in particular, on the behavior of the carriers in the economics and Vodafone has actually
changed some of their subsidy levels. It has only been 30 days or 35 days, but have you seen any changes in demand
levels in the Spanish market as a consequence of some of the activities of the carriers? And that's it for me. Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, Spain has been weak for us and probably more broadly for many companies. Our
revenues grew in Spain last quarter but materially less than we grew in Europe or worldwide. However, that wasn't
cause and effect related to the issue you're on. Spain is just in a terrible economic situation and so I sort of look at that
as an unusual case.
To be clear about what was done, is I think there's also some noise in the pike on this one, what the carriers did was
they still have subsidies for their existing customers, and I don't want to talk about what their existing customer to new
customer ratio is, but you can find out numbers from different parts of the world and model that. They pulled subsidies
on new customers. And so it wasn't a pull of all subsidies, it was a pull of subsidies from new and all carriers in that
market did not do that. A couple of the carriers did. So I wouldn't necessarily use that as a proxy for the world, I guess
is my point.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Keith. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
From JPMorgan, we'll go to Mark Moskowitz.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thanks, a question for Peter. Peter, could you provide us a little more framework or
context for us in terms of understanding how the segments dovetail with the 13% sequential revenue decline in the
guidance? In terms of that bogey, what product segments could be higher in terms of decline or less than that decline?
And then Tim – I'm sorry, go ahead.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. The iPhone, we did expect to have a year-over-year increase and a sequential
decrease for the reasons that both Tim and I discussed. We built channel inventory in the March quarter and we are
exiting March in supply and demand balance. And we had a huge January. And for iPad, we would expect to have a
significant year-over-year and sequential increase in sales.
And I want to put something out, just so it gets out on the call in case it's not asked. We talked a little bit about the
gross margin guidance that we provided for the June quarter. We're pleased to be providing gross margin guidance of
41.5% for the quarter. We expect about two-thirds of the sequential decline to be primarily driven by a higher mix of
iPads and Macs, full quarter of selling the current iPad line-up and the loss of leverage on the sequentially lower
revenue, and we would expect the remainder of the difference to be primarily driven by the items benefiting the March
quarter gross margin that we don't expect to recur in June.

<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes, I can now.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. Great. Thanks. Sorry about that. So just in terms of your flexibility or versatility,
you've been flexible here recently in terms of your cash usage as well as just providing more color or commentary
during your earnings calls. I was just wondering how we should think about opportunities for incremental flexibility as
it relates to patent disputes. Is there a point where Apple feels it reasonable to settle and just continue out-innovating
out-gunning the competition rather than waging ongoing litigation? Other opportunities for that?
<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: You know, I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it. We just want people to
invent their own stuff. And so if we could get some kind of arrangement where we could be assured that's the case and
a fair settlement on the stuff that's occurred, I would highly prefer to settle versus battle. But, you know, the key thing
is that it's very important that Apple not become the developer for the world. We need people to invent their own stuff.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?

Next we'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research Group.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you. My first question is just going back to iCloud. Perhaps, Tim, if you could talk a
little bit more about feedback from customers? Curious, sort of, average number of devices of customers that customers
are putting up or maybe percent of users that are attaching more than one device? Just sort of what's the initial feedback
and then I have a follow-up?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Shannon, its Peter. I don't want to frustrate you, but we have, of course, the data that that
you're asking for, but we don't want to help our competitors and so it's not something we're going to provide publicly.
The feedback that we're getting from customers on iCloud is just off-the-chart. They're loving it. And the fact that we
could be here on a conference call with you on April, just five or six months after introducing the service, and have 125
million people around the world using it every day, I think, speaks for itself.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. And then my follow-up question is just on R&D. It was up 45%; it's over $800
million now. I'm curious, was a chunk of the growth from the acquisitions you've made? Or anything you can tell us in
terms of your thoughts on R&D and investment levels because it's definitely been ramping, which I guess bodes for
good products coming forth in the future.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Well, we view this as a good thing. We are investing in engineering to continue to bring
out the most innovative products in the world to delight customers. We are making investments in our hardware and
software engineering teams. We're shipping the best products that Apple has ever shipped today and we've got some
fabulous new products in the pipeline. So I'm very confident in the return that we're going to see on these investments.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: You used to give sort of an idea of percentage-to-software, percentage-to-hardware. Is there
anything you could give there?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Shannon, I'm sorry. I don't have that in front of me.

of the 4S shipping along with 21 countries early in January. What about China Telecom specifically? When did that
launch?

From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we'll go to Scott Craig.
<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Peter, on the OpEx side, that's an area where you guys have
been getting a fair amount of leverage. If you look year-over-year, it's down pretty significantly as a percentage of
sales. So I'm just curious on your thoughts going forward, maybe not just next quarter, but sort of how do you think
about the OpEx leverage longer term?
And then, Tim, can you just kind of take us through the components, like you do on most quarter calls, where you're
seeing some pricing better than expected and maybe worse than expected and put that in the context of going forward
as well? Thanks.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Scott, it's Peter. We are, as I discussed in Shannon's question, investing in R&D to
introduce the most innovative products in the market. We are also spending on marketing, advertising, opening more of
our own retail stores and expanding our indirect channels around the world to increase sales. And we're investing in
infrastructure to support our growth and also stock-based comp for our employees. We are very confident in the
investments that we're making. We're thinking about the long-term and we're confident in the returns that we're going
to get in on these investments.
<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: Scott, in terms of component costs for the quarter we just finished, Q2 component costs were
better than we had planned and this assisted us in exceeding our gross margin guidance, as Peter talked about earlier.
Displays and NAND Flash drove the majority of the favorable commodity-cost benefit. In terms of the June quarter,
and what we factored into our guidance, NAND and mobile DRAM supply continue to exceed demand and because of
that, we expect pricing will continue to be favorable. For most LCDs, we expect pricing to stabilize as the market
moves to a supply/demand balance. The hard drive market has moved to a supply/demand balance and we expect
market pricing to decline, but will still be higher than the pre-flood level from the tragedy in Thailand. Most other
components are expected to fall in line with, or somewhat faster than, historical trends.

like quite a rapid drop and I'm just wondering how much conservatism is in your gross margin guidance. And then I

have a follow-up for Tim afterwards.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure, Kulbinder. The two-thirds that I talked about of the sequential decline we see as
being driven by a higher mix of iPads than Macs, a full quarter of selling the current line-up of the iPads or the current
iPad line-up and then a loss of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue. So those three factors we see driving
two-thirds of the sequential decline.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay, great. And then, Tim, just a question on the enterprise side. You mentioned a
couple of times how the iPad is being taken into new markets, new verticals whether it's because of the price point or
the innovation. I'm just wondering specifically what resources is Apple dedicating to have a much more direct
relationship with the enterprise. Can you speak about what's changed in the last six or 12 months and what do you think
you need to do to become a more credible or significant enterprise player?
<Q - Timothy D. Cook>: Initially our focus was working with the Fortune 500 and the Global 500 to get the iPad
certified for their particular enterprise and I'm pleased to report that 94% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying
iPads and 75% of the Global 500 are testing or deploying iPads. So these numbers are just off the charts for a product
that's only 24 months old and so we are moving our focus away from this and focusing on penetration within these
accounts.
Peter alluded to some of the wins that we had had in his opening comments. The incredible things about these are that
they span across many verticals through government, through education and many different functions within the
enterprise. It's absolutely the most broad-based product I have ever seen in my whole career in terms of adoption rate
into the enterprise. And so, yes, this means that we're applying more resources in testees and sales people to interact
directly with these customers. We also work with our carrier partners and our reseller partners in delivering both the
product and services that are wrapped around that to these customers.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Kulbinder. Can we have the next question, please?

We'll go to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Chris, are you there?
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: Hello, can you hear me?
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Yes, we can.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: Okay. Sorry about that. If I take your revenue guidance and the comments you made
around gross margin at face value it seems to imply that you expect iPhone unit sales to be down about 10 million units
quarter-on-quarter. First, is that in the right ballpark? And secondly, are you just being conservative with respect to the
outlook, or have you seen a change in the end-demand environment for the phone?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Chris, let me go in reverse order. We are incredibly confident in our business, our strategy
and what we're doing. When we give you guidance we give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in
achieving. And finally, we do expect a sequential decline in iPhone sales driven by the fact that we've built 2.6 million
units of channel inventory in the March quarter, which we needed to do. We are now within our target range of four to
six weeks and we entered the March quarter with significant backlog, as we talked about in January, and were able to
fulfill that and launch 20 countries in the month of January. So we have immense confidence in what we're doing and
are very pleased with the way our business is performing.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: Okay. Thanks for that. The follow-up, if I could, on iPad, it is supply constrained
across many geos as you talked about. Is there a specific component issue? Do you have visibility on resolution? When
do you expect to be able to meet demand on the iPad?
