Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit
earnings growth to kick off 2015, driven by our diverse portfolio and effective execution in what continues to be a
challenging macro-environment. Our earnings per share of $1.41 increased 10% year-over-year, coming in at the high
end of our guidance range.
The macro-environment in the first quarter wasn't easy, with headwinds from extreme weather, port shutdowns,
declining oil and gas investments, and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Sales in the quarter of $9.2 billion, while up 2% on a
core organic basis, were down 5% reported. Our performance was driven by decent organic growth and strong sales
conversion, with segment margins expanding 220 basis points to 18.7%.
And as you'll hear from Tom a bit later, a large portion of the margin expansion came from improving gross margins,
something a bit different than the past. It results from our focus on HOS, both direct and indirect material and new
products. Our key process initiatives are driving meaningful results throughout the portfolio, 140 basis points of the
segment margin-rate improvement was driven by commercial excellence and productivity. The rest of the improvement
comes from smart decisions we've made about the portfolio. An important enabler of the productivity continues to be
the savings we're seeing from previously funded restructuring actions. We're being proactive about keeping that
pipeline full, which we think, is critical to supporting our continued margin expansion in 2016 and beyond.
However, while managing our costs is important, we're also focused on supporting sales growth by investing in
capacity expansion, new products and technologies and resources in high-growth regions. As a result of that strong first
quarter performance and our confidence in the remainder of the year, we're raising the low-end of our full-year
guidance by a $0.05 to a new range of $6 to $6.15, or up 8% to 11% versus the prior year.
As we've been saying since December, we want to ensure we're remaining balanced in our planting for 2015 while
continuing our seed planting investments for the future. In the quarter, we proactively funded about $40 million of
restructuring, building on a healthy pipeline of new projects, and we've continued our transactional and translational
hedging into 2016. The euro is our biggest exposure. In 2015 we've hedged approximately 85% of our euro P&L
exposure at an average rate of about $1.24. For 2016, we have again hedged approximately 85% of our euro P&L
exposure at an average plain rate of $1.10. In the current environment, we believe the certainty this provides is prudent
and generates the time needed to offset the impact in future years.
We also continue to seed planting for exciting new HUE-based products, technologies and process improvements that
will help us to continue to win in the marketplace. On HOS Gold, we're continuing to invest across our Gold
Enterprises to create units that grow faster and are more profitable than our competitors. We want to marry big
company cost efficiency, which is real if it's done correctly and technical and functional excellence with small
company speed and customer responsiveness, accomplishing two seemingly conflicting things at the same time. Each
HOS Gold unit is identifying breakthrough strategies and moves into smart new areas and adjacencies.
In early May, we'll be kicking off our 2015 Technology Symposium, a forum that brings together approximately 400
Honeywell technology, marketing and management representatives from all of the businesses. This annual event, which
started about 10 years ago, provides opportunities for ongoing collaboration and idea generation and is focused on
driving breakthrough innovations supported by differentiated processes and technologies; all of which helps enhance
our great positions in good industries.
Process Solutions opened The Honeywell Industrial Cyber Security Lab in Duluth, Georgia to advance development
and testing of new technologies and software to defend industrial facilities and operations like refineries and
manufacturing plants from cyber attacks. We also recently inaugurated three new research and development labs at the
Honeywell Center of Excellence in Brno, Czech Republic. And we plan to open another five labs within a few months
as part of a $10 million investment in the region to support both Aerospace and ACS.
In March, we closed the acquisition of Datamax-O'Neil, a global manufacturer of fixed and mobile printers.
Datamax-O'Neil's portfolio of solutions expand Honeywell's ability to deliver enhanced workflow performance and the
team is very excited about this acquisition, which builds on existing printing capabilities acquired with Intermec.

Scanning & Mobility continues to execute very well, delivering another quarter of double-digit core organic sales
growth in the first quarter, driven primarily by volume from key wins, most recently the U.S. Postal Service deal signed
last year. We also continue to be excited about the Fluorine Products portfolio, where we saw particular strength, up
double-digits on a core organic basis, driven by the ramp-up of our Solstice low global warming suite of products.
We've seen increasing demand for these products, where we now have a lifetime value of signed agreements of about
$2.6 billion and another $800 million under negotiation.
As we look ahead, we're cautious overall on the macro-environment like I've been for five years. While we continue to
expect that the benefit of lower oil prices will eventually play through in the U.S. and in oil importing nations, this is
really yet to be seen. There was weakness in January across the portfolio that we weren't able to fully recover from, but
we did see good signs of improvement as the quarter progressed. GDP growth rates globally are weaker than most had
expected for the first quarter.
Now we think weather had some impact early in the quarter in the U.S., but the slowdown was not unique to the U.S.
With all that said, the majority of our businesses exited the quarter with momentum following more robust core organic
growth rates in both February and March. Nevertheless, we're going to continue to plan conservatively to navigate the
current headwinds, including oil and gas, and as always, we're not counting on a pickup in the global economy. We are
well-positioned to continue performing in this environment.
Our portfolio is aligned to favorable macro trends and provides significant runway to grow. We have great positions in
good industries. We're investing to grow faster than the markets we serve and we'll stay the course on seed planting and
continuous improvement initiatives. We're going to stay flexible and follow the playbook you've come to expect from
us, so that we can deliver on this year, next year and beyond.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.
Thomas A. Szlosek
Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm now slide four, which shows the first quarter results. Sales of $9.2 billion were
up 2% on a core organic basis, but decreased 5% on a reported basis. The absence of Friction Materials, which you
recall was still in the portfolio for the first half of 2014, further strengthening of the U.S. dollar and raw materials
pricing in Resins & Chemicals were headwinds, driving the negative reported growth this quarter. However,
considering the slow start that we got off to in January, we're actually 8% down in January versus 2014 on a core
organic basis. So even given that slow start, we feel pretty good about the Q1 core organic growth.
Shipment timing in Aerospace, order delays in PMT and unplanned plant outages in Resins & Chemicals prevented us
from fully meeting our sales expectations, but as you'll see later, we expect the growth rate to improve as the year
progresses. And an important note, the 2% core organic sales growth excludes FX, M&A and now the raw material
pricing impact in Resins & Chemicals. Selling prices in Resins & Chemicals include an element of raw material
pass-through, most notably benzene, which is highly correlated to the price of oil. While the pricing model protects
profit dollars, sales can be volatile, so we've modified the definition here to provide further insight into the underlying
volume growth of our businesses.
Segment profit increased 8% with segment margin expanding 220 basis points. The most impressive part about the
segment margin performance is that most of the improvement came through gross margin rates. HOS Gold is working
across Honeywell, from our engineering labs to our factories and supply chains, to our selling and marketing
organizations and even to our back office.
Our deployment of Honeywell User Experience in product development is yielding better products that our customers
are willing to pay for. Our supply chains are becoming even more lean and there's a strong collaboration between our
engineers, sourcing organization and supply chain to drive down our material costs. Our focus on commercial
excellence is yielding more focused sales teams and smarter pricing decisions. Operating costs are in check with SG&A
also contributing to the segment margin rate improvement.

Meanwhile, we continue to devote significant resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of
existing ones. As we said in March, HOS Gold is a game-changer and will be a differentiator for us as it was in this
first quarter. We'll provide some additional color on the Q1 margin expansion in a moment.
The items below segment profit came in as we expected. We had an increase year-over-year in pension income, which
was completely offset by restructuring of approximately $40 million. Note, in the prior period, operating margin
included the restructuring and other charges from the B/E Aero gain deployment, but excluded the gain itself. So
operating margins expanded 340 basis points in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the 220 basis points expansion in
segment margins.
Earnings per share was $1.41, up 10% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. We once again
achieved double-digit earnings growth, driven largely by increases in segment profit. Year-over-year share count was
flat. So a good start on the P&L despite the environment.
Finally, free cash flow in the quarter of $256 million came in, down $240 million from 2014, driven primarily by
timing, including the payment of the fourth quarter 2014 OEM incentives, higher cash taxes and higher working capital
requirements particularly in Aerospace. The first quarter has historically proven to be our lowest from a cash
perspective and we remain on track to our full-year guidance of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion of free cash flow.
We ended the quarter at approximately $1.3 billion negative net cash position. And as we highlighted in March, we
expect to be in a positive net cash position approximating $1 billion to $2 billion by year-end assuming no significant
M&A. Overall, we generated strong results in a relatively slow growth environment.
I'm now on slide five. I talked previously about the nature of our 220 basis-point segment margin improvement. This
slide provides some additional color on specific drivers of that improvement. The first category is the core organic or
operational drivers, which generate 140 basis point of the 220 basis point improvement. We're often asked to quantify
the impact of HOS Gold. This first category is highly correlated to it. We can't always commit to triple-digit margin
expansion from HOS Gold, but you can see that the components touch all critical facets of our businesses.
We're benefiting from commercial excellence, most prominently in Aerospace, as well as significant productivity
improvement and volume leverage across the portfolio. New product introductions and further penetration in
high-growth regions, particularly at ACS, are also part of it. We're also seeing savings from previously funded
restructuring actions. Additionally, as we indicated, we're able to proactively fund another $40 million of restructuring
in the first quarter to improve our overall cost position and drive further margin expansion going forward.
The remaining three categories on this slide individually look pedestrian, but collectively reflect the benefit that our
shareholders are realizing from the strategic decisions we have made and executed on. First, you can see the favorable
margin impact from the Friction Materials divestiture, which we closed in July of 2014. This is a permanent
improvement in our margin rate from exiting a business that did not meet our portfolio standards. You can expect to see
additional year-over-year favorability in the second quarter from this divestiture. And we are always assessing our
portfolio to ensure all of our businesses continue to constitute great positions in good industries.
Second, our hedging approach for foreign currency provided a big benefit. As you know, we made a decision last
summer to expand our hedging approach from protecting our hundreds of individual P&Ls from foreign currency
exposure, that is transactional exposure, to one now where we are protecting the consolidated Honeywell Enterprise, so
that's transactional plus translational exposure. The hedge strategy is in place to protect our operating results, but not
necessarily the top line, thus the margin lift.
Additionally, our emerging markets footprint in our engineering organization, supply chain and back office also protect
us from the strengthening U.S. dollar. These strategies will be worth $0.12 to $0.13 to our shareowners in 2015 and
help drive the margin improvement you see here.
Third, in Resins & Chemicals, we have developed the lowest-cost operating position in the world; a competitive
position, which allows us to run our plants at full capacity. Material costs are passed through to customers so when
raws market conditions are volatile, like we're experiencing today, margin rates can be impacted, in this case favorably,

when the material pass-through and, therefore, sales is reduced, but margin remains the same. Without that low-cost
position, our ability to compete for profitable business would be impaired, as would the margin rates.
Moving to slide six and the Aerospace results. You can see here on the comparative sales stacked bars that we're
highlighting the impacts of inorganic drivers, namely, for Aerospace, foreign exchange headwinds and M&A that is the
Friction Materials divestiture. We followed a similar convention on the subsequent pages for both ACS and PMT.
Sales for the first quarter were up 1% on organic basis, but down 6% reported, driven by the Friction Materials
divestiture and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movement, mostly in turbo. Segment margin was up 250
basis points, driven by productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence, and the favorable impacts from the Friction
divestiture and foreign exchange. So overall, great work by the Aerospace team to drive robust margin expansion.
From a sales perspective, Commercial OE was up 1% on an organic basis. In Air Transport and Regional, we saw a
continued benefit from higher OE build rates at Boeing, Airbus and Embraer, partially offset by intentionally slower
shipments to certain emerging market customers in order to manage temporary funding delays. In business general and
aviation, there were lower-than-expected deliveries on certain platforms that are in transition. Engine demand is robust,
so expect to see a pickup in growth in BGA in the second quarter.
Commercial aircraft sales were up 1% on a core organic basis, driven by strong growth in repair and overhaul
activities, but partially offset by lower spare sales, particularly in China and Russia. We believe that this year represents
a normal run rate for spare sales in China after a significant re-stocking by our airlines customers in 2014. Also, similar
to the OE side, we intentionally slowed spare shipments to certain emerging market customers as a risk management
matter. Overall, we anticipate continued growth in R&O and improvement in spares in the second quarter and into the
second half.
Defense & Space sales were down 1% on a core organic basis. We had lower deliveries in the U.S. due to timing, but
still expect that core organic sales will be up for Defense & Space on balance for the rest of the year. Defense & Space
backlog increased high single-digit year-over-year. We anticipate some ongoing softness in the U.S., but we're very
encouraged by the continued double-digit growth of our international defense business, which continues to be a
tailwind in Defense & Space.
Finally, Transportation Systems sales increased 5% on a core organic basis due to strong volume growth in light
vehicle gas applications where we continue to see increased global penetration. The success we have seen in TS
continued in this quarter and we expect similar growth throughout 2015. On a reported basis, TS sales declined 23%,
reflecting both the Friction Materials divestiture and foreign currency headwinds.
So let's turn to ACS results on slide seven. ACS sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the first quarter, excluding
an approximate 6% headwind from foreign exchange. Across the ACS portfolio, we saw weakness in January, as we
mentioned at our Investor Day in March, followed by steady core organic growth in February and March. All of the
ACS businesses are exiting the quarter with good momentum, giving us confidence going into the second quarter.
ESS sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the first quarter, driven by continued strength in our Scanning &
Mobility, Fire Safety and Security businesses. Scanning & Mobility delivered another quarter of double-digit core
organic sales growth following the double-digit increase for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. The business
continues to perform well, driven by volume from recent program wins, such as the U.S. Postal Service program that
Dave mentioned. In addition, we continued to realize integration benefits from Intermec in the combination of the two
businesses.
As for the rest of ESS, growth continues to be driven by new product introductions and further penetration in
high-growth regions. In particular, China and India each were up close to 15% in the first quarter, with strength across
most of the ESS portfolio and we expect this to continue into the second quarter.
Building Solutions & Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the first quarter with continued strength
in Americas, Fire and Security Distribution businesses and growth in Building Solutions. Within Building Solutions,
we continue to see good growth in our higher-margin service business, and as was the case with ESS, sales in BSD

improved in February and March following a slow start in January. ACS margins expanded 180 basis points in the
quarter to 15.8%. The business continues to benefit from good conversion on higher volumes and significant
productivity improvements, net of inflation.
While the business has been able to control costs and optimize internal processes, our investments for growth,
particularly in new product development and in high-growth regions continue as we have highlighted previously. In
addition, we continue to realize incremental synergy benefits from the combination of Intermec with Scanning &
Mobility. We expect the margin expansion to continue, particularly as the team builds on the Connected ACS initiative,
which Alex talked about at our Investor Day in March.
I'm now on slide eight. And before I review the PMT results, I'd like to provide an update on our oil and gas-related
businesses similar to what we shared in January. Our upstream portfolio, which resides entirely in our Process
Solutions business, comprises controls, solutions and remote operations for deepwater offshore facilities. As we said,
this upstream exploration and production part of the value chain is a small portion of PMT and roughly 1% of
Honeywell sales.
And here despite a significant scale-back in future capital spending plans by international oil companies and national
oil companies which have caused a good deal of volatility in our market, our backlogs have held up and there have
been no cancellations to-date. In fact, we saw a double-digit increase in volume of large order project wins in our
Projects and Automation Solutions business in Process Solutions in the first quarter with approximately one-third of
that increase residing in our upstream segment.
But discretionary spend, both CapEx and OpEx, is being cut across the board in this segment. And we felt the impact of
these actions at HPS in particular. We are seeing softness in our short-cycle field instrumentation business tied to both
project delays as well as reductions to maintenance, repair and operations budgets. Our orders in the second quarter will
be challenged as a result, but we'll continue to leverage our strong cost productivity actions to offset any downturn in
2015. It's also worth mentioning that 45% of HPS is not tied to oil and gas, which further highlights our relatively low
exposure to the volatility upstream.
Moving to midstream, roughly a third of the UOP business, so the gas processing piece and about a quarter of the HPS
business, which comprises gas metering and transfer, safety and security, and terminals is considered midstream. So
think of oil and gas recovery, upgrading, treating pipelines and storage. While we saw a tremendous growth in our gas
processing sales in the first quarter, particularly in UOP Russell, which was up double-digits on a core organic basis,
our midstream business overall has been impacted by the steep reduction in the U.S. gas and oil rig count, and we did
see one cancellation of approximately $35 million in our gas processing business in the U.S. in this quarter.
Orders are expected to continue to be challenged across our midstream business, including in HPS where customers are
delaying spending decisions and cutting discretionary spend and also delaying conversion of orders and backlog.
However, we also anticipate that international gas processing projects for modular equipment and additional service
sales to U.S. customers will help to mitigate the softness in the U.S. in 2015 and 2016.
Finally, our downstream segment primarily includes petrochemical and refining, which comprises about two-thirds of
UOP, and that's mostly process technologies, equipment and catalysts, and approximately 20% of HPS, which is
process controls, field instruments, service and optimization. Here we're experiencing delays and reductions in
countries that are net oil producers like Russia as refining and petrochemical project decisions are deferred.
A notable exception is the Middle East, where we've seen new wins and an active pipeline of new bids, particularly in
the UAE and Saudi Arabia. And we're encouraged by the expected growth in HPS and UOP in the region. Also,
two-thirds of the aforementioned double-digit increase in orders growth in the Projects and Automation Solutions
business in HPS is in this downstream refining sector. As the infrastructure investments continue to ramp in the Middle
East, we anticipate continued positive growth in 2015 and 2016.
In the oil importing countries, mainly China and India, the benefit of the lower cost oil imports is mostly being
absorbed by the national government and is not currently being invested in energy projects. However, we do see
continued momentum in the catalyst first load and reload activity for methanol to olefin and Oleflex licenses in China,

and a similar positive level of activity in India, particularly in our short-cycle businesses in HPS.
We're continuing to see existing projects progress and none has been abandoned. However, the initiation of new
projects has been extremely slow. Overall, however, we continue to believe that in the mid to long term, the impact
further downstream will be neutral to, in some cases, positive despite the delays we have seen thus far.
Sales in parts of our Resins & Chemical business continue to be negatively impacted by the market-based pricing
whereby selling prices are closely tied to the market price of raw materials, most notably benzene, which is highly
correlated to the price of oil as we've discussed since December. While lower raw material costs continue to be a
headwind to the top line, the pricing model protects profit dollars even on those lower sales. We now expect this will
approximate a $400 million headwind to our reported sales in 2015.
In ACS, a small portion of our Industrial Safety businesses, the portable gas detection and safety products businesses
participate in oil and gas-related end markets. We have seen minor impacts due to the recent workforce reductions,
mainly in the upstream segment. While demand for our gas detection and safety products has slowed, we continue to
expect lower oil prices to eventually create demand side favorability across the remainder of the ACS portfolio.
In terms of operating expenses, we are seeing favorable cost trends across the portfolio, including in our freight,
utilities and another supply chain costs, as well as in our other indirect spend. We expect this will continue to be a nice
tailwind for us throughout 2015 and continue to look for ways to drive further productivity and cost savings across the
portfolio.
In terms of the second derivative impacts, we highlighted in December that we anticipate that the emerging airline
profitability from lower oil prices could drive further activity with that customer segment. In addition, lower prices at
the pump, improvements in employment, and overall positive consumer sentiment have driven greater demand for
autos, where we are benefiting from increased demand for turbocharger technologies. The impact to our short-cycle
business on the whole thus far has been neutral, but we expect an increase in demand across the portfolio as lower oil
prices persist.
On balance, the headwinds we are seeing in our oil and gas business will continue to present challenges in the near to
midterm, and we continue to plan conservatively to mitigate the impacts in this area. We do expect to eventually see
some positive impacts from lower oil prices, which will benefit our short-cycle businesses particularly in ACS as the
benefit makes its way further downstream to consumers. We're also encouraged by the benefit to our own cost
structure, which will continue to provide a nice tailwind in 2015 and 2016.
I'm moving to slide nine for PMT first quarter results. PMT sales in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 3% on a core
organic basis and down 5% on a reported basis. The reported decline was driven by foreign exchange headwinds and
the impact of lower oil prices on Resins & Chemicals as we have spoken about before.
Starting with UOP, sales were up 9% on the core organic basis, driven primarily by higher gas processing sales,
particularly at UOP Russell. As a reminder, UOP grew 9% on a core organic basis in the first quarter of 2014 as well.
So exceptional growth even against a difficult year-over-year comp. Orders were roughly flat in the quarter with strong
growth in the product technologies and equipment business offsetting declines in gas processing, which are mostly
timing-related. As you know, we are in the midst of adding UOP capacity, particularly on the catalyst side, which will
help the business better service its backlog, which continues to hold firm.
In Process Solutions, sales were below our expectations. Core organic sales down 3% and reported sales down 11%.
Obviously, foreign exchange headwinds impacted our reported sales. Orders overall were slightly down in the quarter
as we experienced some order delays particularly in March as we approach the quarter end. While we're not seeing
order cancellations in HPS, some customers are delaying project startups, and in some cases, future capital spending
decisions.
Still on balance, our Projects business had a strong orders quarter, up strong double-digits, primarily driven by the
Middle East, where we see infrastructure investments continuing. Discretionary spend is under pressure, which
primarily impacted our orders and sales growth in our Field Products business. Our service backlog is holding up well

with low single-digit sales growth, a reflection of our comprehensive offerings to our strong installed base. Process
Solutions backlog increased high single-digit year-over-year, which gives us confidence that the sales growth rates will
eventually improve.
Advanced Materials sales were up 2% on a core organic basis and decreased 12% reported, again, primarily driven by
foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of lower oil prices on Resins & Chemicals. In addition, we had unplanned
outages in our Resins & Chemicals plants that had a negative impact on production volumes and segment margin in the
quarter. The rest of the Advanced Materials saw positive core organic growth in the quarter particularly in Fluorine
Products, which again grew double-digit as demand for Solstice products continues to grow.
PMT margins were up 230 basis points to 21.5%, which exceeded our guidance, driven by commercial excellence,
significant productivity actions, net of inflation, and higher UOP and Fluorine Products volumes as we've discussed.
This was partially offset by the Resins & Chemicals unplanned plant outages we highlighted and continued investments
for growth across PMT.
So in summary, despite less sales growth than expected, the business continues to deliver on results. Also PMT is
aggressively pursuing cost reduction opportunities in anticipation of potential further top line pressure.
I'm now on slide 10 with a preview of the second quarter. For total Honeywell, we're expecting sales of $9.6 billion to
$9.8 billion, up 2% to 3% on a core organic basis, but down 4% to 6% reported. We think we're being prudent in our
planning approach given the slow start to the top line we saw in the first quarter. Segment margins are expected to be
up approximately 130 basis points to 150 basis points versus 2014. We expect our segment margin rate to again benefit
from the factors that drove the significant first quarter margin expansion, especially operational excellence and
execution.
We do anticipate higher engineering sales and marketing investments in the second quarter as well as a less favorable
sales mix and lower margin rate benefit from the Friction Materials, foreign currency and Resins & Chemicals raw
materials pricing drivers I explained earlier. Given these factors and our conservative planning, the segment margin
expansion may not be as robust as Q1, but will still be well into the triple-digit range. With that said, second quarter
EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.51, up 7% to 10% versus 2014 on a basis normalized for tax at 26.5%
in both years.
Moving to the businesses, Aerospace sales are expected to be up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis, or down 5% to 7%
on a reported basis, reflecting the year-over-year absence of Friction Materials sales as well as anticipated foreign
currency headwinds in the quarter. In Commercial OE, we expect core organic sales will be up low single-digit, driven
primarily by continued healthy demand in mid to large-cabin business aircraft where we have significant new content,
partially offset by the timing of ATR OE build rates.
In Commercial Aftermarket, we expect core organic sales to be up low to mid single-digit with continued repair and
overhaul and ATR spares growth, partially offset by slower BGA spares growth. Defense & Space sales are expected to
be approximately flat on a core organic basis, driven by continued strength in the international business, offset by a
decline in the U.S. as we've highlighted.
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up mid-single-digit on a core organic basis, but down significantly
on a reported basis. Similar to the first quarter, the growth in TS on a core organic basis is primarily driven by new
launches and strong light vehicle gas turbo volume globally. As for Aerospace margins, we expect an increase of 140
basis points to 160 basis points in the second quarter, driven by commercial excellence, significant productivity
improvements across the portfolio and favorable impacts of the Friction Materials divestiture.
ACS sales are expected to be up 4% to 5% on a core organic basis, or down 1% to 3% on a reported basis, with
mid-single-digit core organic growth in ESS and continued growth in BSD. The difference between the reported and
organic core growth rates reflects the foreign currency headwinds in the quarter. The trends in the end markets where
we primarily participate, residential, commercial and industrial continue to be consistent with what we highlighted in
December.

We continue to benefit from new product introductions and high-growth region penetration, as we saw in China and
India in the first quarter. ACS margins are expected to be up 80 basis points to 100 basis points, driven by good
conversion on higher volumes, commercial excellence and continued productivity net of inflation while maintaining the
investments for growth I spoke about earlier.
In PMT, sales are expected to be down 1% to approximately flat on a core organic basis and down approximately 7% to
9% reported, driven by foreign currency headwinds and the continued impact of lower oil prices on Resins &
Chemicals. We're expecting UOP to be down mid-single-digit on a core organic basis, primarily driven by difficult
year-over-year comps in our catalyst business, partially offset by continued growth in gas processing. You'll remember
we experienced double-digit sales growth in the catalyst business in the second quarter of 2014.
In HPS, we're expecting core organic sales to be approximately flat. We continue to see delays in the conversion of
orders and backlog, particularly in the large projects business, offset by software and services growth in our large
installed base. On the Advanced Materials side, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth on a core organic basis,
principally driven by continued strength in Fluorine Products.
Overall, PMT segment margins in the quarter are expected to be up 240 basis points to 260 basis points versus 2014,
driven by productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence and the favorable margin rate impact of the
market-based pricing model in Resins & Chemicals. The second quarter will be challenging for PMT, however, the
conservative cost actions we've taken give us confidence in our ability to deliver our forecast.
Let me move to slide 11 for an update on our full-year guidance. You can see revised sales and margin targets for 2015.
The reported sales growth is expected to be lower than the core organic growth, principally due to foreign currency
headwinds, the impact of the Friction Materials divestiture, and raw materials pricing in Resins & Chemicals. Our end
markets are generally holding up with commercial and industrial momentum largely offsetting the headwind in oil and
gas. And I'll get into more detail on this in a moment.
Our new sales guidance reflects the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since we provided our initial outlook back
in December. For example, we're now planning for a euro exchange rate of approximately $1.10 for the remainder of
the year and have similar revisions for other currencies and now expect an approximate $1.7 billion headwind to the top
line from foreign currency for the full year.
To remind you, our operating profits are protected from further U.S. dollar strengthening by our hedging approach,
even though the top line is adversely impacted. For example, with the euro, our operating profits are protected at a rate
of about $1.24. And as Dave indicated, for 2016 we're taking a similar approach. We put hedges in place to cover
approximately 85% of our 2016 euro P&L exposure at the planning rate of approximately $1.10.
On a core organic basis, our sales growth for 2015 is now approximately 3%. This reflects the slow start we had in the
first quarter and the risks associated with order delays we've seen to-date, primarily in Aerospace and PMT. In ACS,
there are some minor puts and takes among the businesses, but overall, the outlook for the rest of the year remains
intact and we continue to expect good core organic growth, particularly in our short-cycle businesses.
We're raising our segment margin targets in all businesses due to the favorable drivers previously discussed, including
commercial excellence, HOS, restructuring and a continued focus on managing our costs as well as the impact of the
foreign currency hedges and the market-based pricing model in Resins & Chemicals. In addition, as Dave mentioned,
we're raising the low end of our EPS guidance ex-pension mark-to-market by $0.05 to $6 to $6.15 per share,
representing 8% to 11% growth versus 2014 and providing the framework for another year of strong earnings growth in
what continue to be a challenging global economy. This range continues to be based on a full-year income tax rate
assumption of 26.5% and share count held roughly flat to 2014 levels.
We continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, up 8% to 10% from 2014 with CapEx
investments peaking this year at roughly 2 times depreciation. At a more approximate rate of CapEx investment
approximately 1.25 times depreciation, we would expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100%, and we
expect to be at those levels again by 2017. So overall, still a very balanced outlook for the year.

Let me move on to slide 12. With the first quarter in the books, we thought it'd be helpful to provide an update on how
we see things in our key end markets and how they are impacting our planning for the remainder of 2015.
Starting with Aerospace, the outlook on the commercial side is largely the same as we outlined in March as OE build
rates and flight hours remain strong. On the Commercial OE side, we still expect to benefit from build rate schedules
and a ramp-up in new platforms, including Airbus A350 and ATR and the Bombardier Challenger 350 and Embraer
Legacy 500 and BGA. Flight hours for ATR are expected to grow approximately 4% in 2015 similar to 2014. And on
the business jet side, we expect the flight hours for large cabin aircraft will continue to grow in 2015, up
mid-single-digit reflecting the continued healthy demand in the cabin size sector we are more represented.
In Defense & Space, we're seeing strong international demand as defense budgets continue to grow. This is supported
by the 20% plus core organic growth we saw in our international business in the first quarter and a very strong backlog.
We expect the U.S. portion of the business to stabilize, consistent with the U.S. DoD budgets despite the timing delays
we encountered in the first quarter.
In the automotive market, we're seeing the market improving as turbo adoption continues in the light vehicle gas
segment globally and as light vehicle production picks up. This should bode well for us going forward as we expect to
outpace the industry in gasoline turbo wins.
Moving to ACS. Residential markets continue to grow at a steady pace as urbanization in high-growth regions
progresses. We continue to accelerate our investments in the connected home space where we have a strong installed
base and market channel, and where we expect to benefit from new product introductions in both ECC and security.
On the non-res side, we continue to expect acceleration in commercial construction spending and our positive outlook
for the full year remains intact despite a slower-than-anticipated start. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a strong growth
in our short-cycle businesses in Fire and Security and expect that positive end market trends will continue to drive
growth in these businesses.
As for Building Solutions, the strong backlog from our projects business and service bank continue to support an
improvement for the remainder of 2015. On the industrial side, we continue to benefit from increasing safety standards
across the globe as activity picks up in both the U.S. and in our high-growth regions. So overall, very similar to where
we were in March and good momentum as we head into the second quarter.
We've touched a lot on PMT already, but to summarize, the impacts from oil and gas are becoming clearer and more
pronounced than we initially anticipated. However, we continue to proactively address PMT's cost position and are
confident in how we're managing our exposure to the sector. In Advanced Materials, we continue to see robust demand
for our low-global-warming Solstice products supporting the significant investments we've made in this business
heading into 2015 and 2016. We once again saw double-digit core organic growth in Fluorine Products in this quarter.
Let's now move to our updated full-year segment guidance on page 13. Let me explain the setup here. The left-hand
side of the slide represents the guidance as of our December outlook and an estimate of the core organic sales growth
under those assumptions. The 5% growth we show here on a core organic basis is on the same basis as the 4% organic
growth we previously articulated. We simply restated the 5% to reflect the adjustment for the Resins & Chemicals price
impact.
The right half reflects our current guidance, including the first quarter results and latest outlook by business on a core
organic basis. We won't get into all details again, but just want to highlight that our core organic growth expectations in
Aero and ACS are down slightly given the slow start and PMT has been adversely impacted, as previously explained.
However, we continue to expect good margin improvement across the businesses for the reasons I discussed earlier.
We continue to take a conservative approach to the rest of the year. We're committed to our EPS outlook, raising the
low end while continuing to invest for the future in seed planting and additional restructuring. This confidence is
derived from the good visibility we have on new products and technologies, our penetration of high-growth regions,
our conservative cost planning, and the deployment of our key process initiatives as part of HOS Gold.

Let's turn to slide 14 for a brief wrap-up before we move on to Q&A. This was another quarter where the Honeywell
business model and HOS enabled us to set and exceed challenging performance expectations. The quarter started slow
and not all the markets we participated in were giving us help, but we picked up momentum and exited on a strong note
with significant outperformance in both segment margin and EPS.
Our shareholders are benefiting from a diverse portfolio with great technologies and long and short-cycle exposure, one
that continues to derive significant benefits from comprehensive globalization and one that will further benefit from the
significant firepower that we have on our balance sheet. With a little more help from the economy, we are
well-positioned to continue outperformance throughout 2015, all the while seeding and feeding our growth initiatives.
Like all of you, we're also thinking about what's beyond 2015. Each of our HOS Gold Enterprises are hard at work on
their five-year strategic plan, which Dave and his staff will dive into before our next earnings call. And as you've
already heard, some of our early actions we've taken for 2016, including additional restructuring and hedging of our
foreign currency exposures. We look forward to sharing more over the course of 2015.
With that, let's move on to the Q&A segment.

Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Scott.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Hi, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Guys, what happened in January? Is there any kind of general theme to why January started
so weak for you?
<A - David M. Cote>: I wish there was. Interestingly, at least from the talking that I did around the HON, we weren't
alone. I mean, this was kind of a phenomenon that some even saw in the banking community. It was just something
about January that caused everything to be a slowdown. And I'd have to say, I was a little nervous as we were in
January, and then things turned in February and turned bigger in March. So I can't explain it. It just happened.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: And it was pervasive, Scott, across the almost every one of our...
<A - David M. Cote>: Around the world.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Our business units, everywhere.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yeah. That's amazing. Okay. Good. And then I struggle sometimes – I mean, your margins
are exceptional and continue to be on the right path. But what does HOS really mean to margins? Can you quantify it at
all? I remember when you went from nothing to Bronze, it was a pretty meaningful step-up. Is Gold as meaningful of a
step-up when you come up from Silver?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, well, it is pretty meaningful I'd say, being able to get there. We don't have that many
units that are actually there at Gold yet. That's one of the things that – that's why we think there's a lot more
improvement left in the company. It's tough to quantify exactly what the dollar amount is or the rate amount that comes

from HOS. But it's going to continue to grow, because as we've tried to show in the past, it doesn't just kind of raise
your overall level, but it raises your improvement rate per year also. So think of it as not just the first derivative
improvement, it's a second derivative improvement also. So I'm actually quite encouraged about what this is going to
continue to be able to do for us.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah. And I would add that the way we're defining HOS Gold, as we talked about at the
Investor Day, it cuts across the entire business and enterprise, whereas once it was focused on factories and the supply
chain, it now extends to engineering and product development, commercial excellence, dealing with our customers and
the like. So all of those things were contributors, as I tried to articulate when I explained that 140 basis points
expansion in the first quarter.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: And last, just quickly, on M&A, are the gating factors really price or is availability of assets,
or both?
<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say it's more price now than anything else. Prices are just high. This is – we're going to
continue to be disciplined and be smart about this. But prices are high right now. I mean, you haven't heard me say that
much in the past, but this time they are.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yeah. We hear that from everyone. So, great. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on.
<A - David M. Cote>: All right. See you, Scott.
Operator
We will go next Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey. Can we just get a little more color on UOP? I may have missed it, Tom, when you went
through all that detail. But what were UOP orders actually like in the quarter? And if we think about the capacity that
you have coming on, is it still fully sold and how firm is the backlog in that business?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, well, the orders were roughly flat in the quarter for UOP, but it was kind of A Tale
of Two Cities. The gas businesses are being impacted by delays. We think there was a significant amount of orders that
were pushed out into the second quarter and third quarter on the international side. So we're expecting those to come
back in. But on the other hand, the technologies and equipment business, performance technology and equipment had
an outstanding orders. Orders grow strong, strong double-digits growth. Catalysts were essentially flat to the year. So
overall, those were the contributors to UOP. Good activity and the backlog as well, down a little bit, but overall in
pretty good shape.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And on the expansion?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: And to answer the question on expansion, that demand is still there. I was actually at the
[indiscernible] (51:32) factory in the first quarter. And it will be – it is starting to run at full capacity. So really excited
about those investments that we're making and the capital spending plans are all on schedule and we're going to hit the
targets and get the market benefit.
<A - David M. Cote>: On the expansions, Jeff, I'm more worried about making sure we hit the startup date than
anything else because the demand for the products is there.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. Great. And just on the hedging, is the hedge only on the euro? Or you're hedging other
currencies where you can? At that rate? At that kind of 85% coverage?

<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, it's not just the euro, Scott, or Jeff, it's all the currencies where we have exposure.
We take a comprehensive look at our long – the currencies where we're long, the currencies where we're short, the
currencies where we manufacture versus the currencies where we only sell. It's a comprehensive model. But in the end,
we end up doing comprehensive hedging in a number of different currencies, euro, GBP, Australian dollar, others. And
we get some natural benefit from currencies that we aren't currently locking in. So on balance, it's not just the euro.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then given kind of the peculiarity of January, I know it's early, but any thoughts on how
April is starting? I mean, there are just so many crosscurrents out there, is this pickup in February and March that you
saw, is it continuing into the early part of the second quarter here?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, it's a little tough to tell at this point, but we think it's going to be – I don't know that it's
going to be as strong as it was in February and March, but it's certainly going to be a lot better than January.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.
Operator
And we'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: On the Aerospace side, you mentioned some funding issues, I guess, from some
customers. I know that GE talked about some supply chain dynamics going on out there, I guess, PCP, there have been
some issues around, I guess, seating with the 787. What is maybe the flavor of what's going on in the commercial
Aerospace side? If you give us a little more – some more details around that?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, happy to clarify that comment, Steve. It was more to deal with the commercial side and
customers. Emerging market regions, particularly in Russia, with the impact that the global economy has had and the
sanctions have had, our customers, some of our customers are experiencing some funding delays. And so we've held up
shipment until we can get those clarified. We're 100% confident it's going to resolve itself and already is resolving
itself in the second quarter. So it's more a matter of risk management than any kind of demand issue.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Does that – I mean, I guess, Dave, at a higher level, is that a comment on what's going
on out there financially in emerging markets? Or is that an Aerospace-specific type of thing?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say this is more Aero-specific in certain emerging market countries.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So not something we should kind of from just a liquidity perspective out there
globally, there's a lot going on with currencies and the central banks shoot money all over the place. So I guess, we
shouldn't be kind of concerned about this more globally for the economy?
<A - David M. Cote>: No. Absolutely not.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - David M. Cote>: It is definitely concentrated in Russia, Steve...
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Okay.
<A - David M. Cote>: And Russia is – you know the size of Russia for us.

<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Got it. And then just on UOP, what's kind of the size of the international
opportunity at Thomas Russell again? I know you guys have talked about, I don't know, like something like bidding on
10 projects and you guys have given some revenue numbers. I'm just – that business is clearly going to have a little bit
of a rough patch here. It's only $500 million in revenues. But what is kind of the size of international? Can you put that
in a context as far as what the opportunity there is to kind of fill the hole in 2016?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. I'd say it's a little tougher to say how big it could be because we're not quite sure
ourselves. It's a lot bigger even than we anticipated when we first did the acquisition. And we continue to be pretty
encouraged by the stuff we're finding. So what we're seeing is much greater strength on the international side and, of
course, less on the U.S. side. So we expect that the international piece of this is going to be a really good positive for
that business.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Can it be...
<A - David M. Cote>: I can't put a number on it right now.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Right. But, I guess, could it be somewhat material to that $500 million business in
2016?
<A - David M. Cote>: Oh, yes, yes, definitely.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Okay. So you can see some of that come through to offset whatever we may see
in Russell for 2016. And then one last question. You said $0.10 of exposure to this kind of euro hedging dynamic in
2016, I guess, at the Investor Day. I'm just doing a rough math on what you said. I guess, is it now about $0.15? Or is it
still around – what's the actual year-over-year headwind number for 2016 as we stand today?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, Steve, I would compare the $1.24 that I mentioned that were hedged after the euro to
next year's rate, which will be $1.10. And...
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: ... you can kind of apply that to our business. I think the range we gave still is intact.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So it's around $0.10 still, no real change there?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah. It's reasonable to think about it as like a penny for a penny.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Right.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: So it's reasonable to think about it that way. And I think it's important to think about it in
the context of $6.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay. Thanks.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Thanks, Steve.

We'll go next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. Dave, you mentioned before in answering the earlier question that prices were high
in M&A and the current environment is a gating factor right now. I know you're a patient guy sometimes, but how long
and – not many topics, right, but how long – and what happens on your capital deployment strategy? Do you start to
consider other means of returning capital? Or you just say, look, over a long enough cycle, it still makes sense to wait.

What are you thinking?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say, first of all, you've characterized me correctly. I'm generally more impatient about
things except when it comes to spending money, in which case, I want to make sure that we're smart. The New
Hampshire [ph] chief (58:47) in me still would bug me to overpay for something.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I have to agree with both of those.
<A - David M. Cote>: At the end of the day, though, we're still pretty much going to stick with what we talked about
in that $1 billion to $2 billion net cash position, at which point we'll start doing more on the repurchase side. And I
think that's still a reasonable and a smart place to be overall. So it preserves firepower for those times when we can be
opportunistic, but also says we're not going to let this get excessive.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. All right. And then the acceleration at least it's baked in sequentially for ACS
organically. Market dynamics that you're seeing in non-res specifically, could you maybe just also give a little more
color? Are you still seeing that strengthening? Are you seeing kind of oil and gas regional slowdown impacting any of
those projects, the construction ones, not the oil and gas side of it, what are you seeing in that market?
<A - David M. Cote>: The way I'd describe it is that it's stronger than our overall organic growth rate, not as strong as
we thought it would be, but it looks like a lot of that was – I think, a lot of that might have been weather impacted. And
we're anticipating that it continues to strengthen during the course of the year. Tom, anything you want...
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah. If you look at the products that serve that or the businesses that serve that sector, the
non-res sector, Steve, they were between 3% and 4% organic growth for the quarter. So I think it's very much in line
with what we think the markets are doing.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. All right. I'm sure you have a lot of people waiting, so I'll pass it on. Thanks.
<A - David M. Cote>: All right. Thank, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay.
Operator
We'll go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So interesting on the organic growth, you're one of the few companies we've heard of so far
where trends actually got better as the quarter progressed. I mean, you actually had some companies talk about March
not happening. And so I'm curious, Dave, from your perspective, what kind of impact do you think that oil and gas and
the currency moves here in the U.S. are having on just industrial CapEx spend broadly and how that impacts your
business?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, I would say the CapEx side, I mean, the only real effect that we're seeing is on the oil and
gas piece of this. I'd be hard-pressed to point to something else where I would – where I could say that currency was
having an impact on those decisions. I don't know, Tom, if anything comes to your mind or anything else?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No.
<A - David M. Cote>: So that's the only one that I could see. That's more oil price impacted than it is currency.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Yeah. It seems like there's more of a direct impact to your business, but nothing indirect that
you guys are hearing from your customers today.

<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. I would say, in general, when it comes to FX, the only effect we're really seeing is on the
translation side. And as you know, we hedged the income number there. And so it shows up on the sales side, but
preserves the income side, which is one of the reasons our margins look good and geez, I think we should be getting
kudos for being smart on how we hedged this year and next.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: I'll give you kudos. It's by far the number one question I got from investors heading into the
quarter. So I think tabling some of that risk was definitely a smart and prudent move on your part.
Maybe one other question, because you did mention the margins. I mean, in your core operations, the margin expansion
this quarter really good despite slower organic growth than expected. You've got this like five-year target at the high
end of 75 basis points, and assuming organic growth continues to improve with the capacity investments that you've
made, it would seem to me that that 75 basis points should be a lot steeper. So maybe some comments around the
conservatism around the high end of that guidance range over your five-year planning period.
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I would love to see that myself. And as you know, margin rates are a combination of a lot
of things. So we're going to continue to drive it. I'm very committed to that five-year plan and understand what I
promised I'd deliver there. So there's a whole combination of things that go into it. And yeah, I'd love to see that margin
rate improvement continue, and I don't see any reason why we don't continue with a triple-digit increase this year.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: All right. Helpful, guys. Thank you.
<A - David M. Cote>: See you, Joe.
Operator
We will go next to Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. So just wanted – just to come back to this January issue again. If I just do the rough math, and
maybe Tom can help me out here. It looks like February and March trended up 5%. And I'm sure that benefited from a
little bit of the snapback from January. First of all, is that correct? And secondly, given all the macro volatility, do you
think we're in a, sort of, a more volatile month-over-month pattern from here on, Dave?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I don't know that it's going to be more volatile month-by-month. I would say, though, I
really do believe that lower oil prices are going to play through bigger in the macro economy than what we've seen so
far, especially in the U.S. And this is kind of the longest the consumer has gone historically with not spending kind of
newfound riches, whether it's through oil price or tax refunds.
So I think we're going to start to see the benefit of that sooner rather than later. I don't think it waits till next year. That
being said, I don't want to count on it, either, because if I'm wrong, that's not a good place to be. So I don't think that
kind of what we saw, January, February, March continues. And then we'll see something that's a little more stable going
forward.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: And on your first question, Nigel, yes, you got it pretty much right in terms of the Feb and
March numbers.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the Aerospace. You called out tough China comps, you
called out Russia. But outside of those regions, would you say on the – especially on the ATR side, that airlines –
airline behavior was consistent with plan? And did provisioning have any impact on either the quarter or the
year-over-year comp?

<A - David M. Cote>: Provisioning didn't have that much impact on us that I'm aware of. And yeah, airlines have been
pretty consistent. And I actually think Aerospace improves during the course of the year because of the timing on some
of the shipments that didn't happen in the first quarter.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah. I think also – when you look at it by region, it's quite interesting, Nigel. And we had
mid-single-digit growth in spares, ATR spares in the U.S., but because of those China issues, we were definitely
weighed down.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then just finally, you announced a big order in Egypt – Egyptian refinery, $1.4 billion.
When does that start hitting the backlog?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I'm not sure.
<A - David M. Cote>: I don't know if that's in the backlog number yet.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.

We'll go next to Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Good morning, gentleman. Thank you.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Dave – thank you. Dave, there's been a lot of stimulus efforts in Europe to help the
economy. We can see a little bit of it in air traffic. What about on the ground in some of the ACS businesses or
elsewhere?
<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say ACS, we're starting see some improvement. I don't think it hit as fast as what you'd see
on the Aerospace side. But yeah, we're expecting that that's going to play through, especially as that economy gets
closer to 2%.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I mean, is there any market you can see better? I mean, is it still just Germany? Or you see
France improving or Spain or anything of the order?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would just kind of – I'd say leave it as a general comment. The North is still stronger overall.
And I think it's going to take a little bit of, say, a few more months before, say, some of the Southern economies really
start to feel it.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: But it sounds to me, though, like you're being very conservative, and it's still a wait-and-see.
You're not adding people or anything like that at the moment.
<A - David M. Cote>: Like I say, I am definitely not adding people in Europe.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thanks. I get it.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Howard, just to put a little color on that. I mean, as we've continually said over the last two
or three years, Europe and Africa for us have been relatively 1%, 0%, minus 1%, consistently
quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter. This year was similar. To your point, Aero was stronger. We also saw good
performance in the turbo business, good volume growth, as the gas penetration continues to grow. So – but it nets out to
similar to the environments that we've seen in the past for Europe.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I appreciate that. I'm just – you don't want them to spend all that money and not get anything
for it. And you have a lot of early cycle businesses and that's why I asked.

<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. I think it will show up, Howard. I don't think, though, this turns Europe around. I do
believe that we'll see some short-lived impact from all of this, but at the end of the day, they still need to address a lot
of their social issues. And my fear is that some of this is going cause them to delay taking the actions that they need to,
to become more competitive as a region.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then, just as a follow-up in a slightly different vein. You have talked a lot about new
products. And could you elaborate a little bit on what we might see in a fashion later in the year in terms of – it sounds
like a lot of things are going to happen in ACS, either in connected home. As you're sort of previewing ideas to the
dealers or otherwise, when might we expect some rollout impact from this?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. As is typical with us, and I know you hear me talk about this diversity of opportunity a
lot and that while there's never any one big thing that's going to hurt us, which I think is a good way to run the play,
there's never any one big thing that's going to make all the difference for us, either. Rather, it's going to be a series of
products and a number of areas they're going to make the difference here. And I'm actually pretty encouraged. And
some of the gross margin rate improvement you saw was attributable to just being able to introduce new products at
better margin rates because it adds more value. And I think you're going to – I feel pretty confident you're going to
continue to see more of that.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome, Howard.
Operator
And we will take our final question from Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thanks a lot for fitting me in, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hi, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: So my question is just a follow-up on Joe Ritchie's question. Obviously, the margins were
fantastic in the quarter, but if I look at your core growth outlook, the 2018 target is 4% to 6% top line. And last year we
were below this target and the idea was that we're going to accelerate into 2015. And as I look at your organic growth
target for 2015, it seems we're actually decelerating versus 2014 2% to 3% versus 3%. So does that mean that the plan
now is more about margins as opposed to organic growth? Has the balance shifted between the two given what we're
seeing now for two years?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say 2018 is still three years away. And things have a way of changing. And, of course,
we're trying to make sure that we end up in that range, that combination of sales growth and margin rate growth. And
right now, last year and this year, organic sales were not as good as what we'd hoped for largely because global GDP
didn't even achieve the kind of conservative numbers that we felt we had in there.
So I'd say, yeah, we're going make sure that we continue to work on both. If GDP growth isn't there to support that kind
of organic sales growth, then you'll probably see even more margin rate improvement, and vice versa. If global GDP
does start to take off and sales start to improve, well, you'll see more attributable to the sales side. So we're still
committed to those five-year targets. And we're going to continue to work both of those variables.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: That's a great...
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: If I could add the – as we talked about at the Investor Day, we are experiencing really good
win rates. And we are expecting inflection points in Aerospace and in PMT given the investments that we've made and
the new platforms that we're on. So I think that's going to be a nice catalyst. And we still obviously have our eye on
organic growth as a big part.

<A - David M. Cote>: That's a good point, Tom. And we talked about that on the Investor Day where those inflection
points, those are definitely happening.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And if I can just squeeze in one technical question, in terms of your change in your methodology
for PMT for input costs, what kind of impact did it have in terms of your organic growth number? Did it have a
negative impact for the annual guidance? I just didn't quite understand that.
<A - David M. Cote>: It's about 0.5 point, I'd guess.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: About 0.5 point for the quarter, yeah.
<A - David M. Cote>: The reason that we excluded, Andy, is just that it has no impact on operating income, and you
want to use that as a proxy for volume and what's occurring out there in your actual shipments. So the shipments are
actually fine, operating income is just fine. And in fact, it increases our margin rates because of it. So that's why we
excluded it, because it just didn't seem to make sense.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: No. Terrific. I really appreciate the comment. Thanks a lot.
<A - David M. Cote>: All right, Andy. Thanks.

And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the
conference back to Dave Cote for closing comments.
David M. Cote
In a difficult first quarter macro-environment, we were actually quite pleased with our operating performance, and I
hope you were, too. Our initiatives like HOS Gold, HUE and software are working. And our business model continues
to deliver. Raising our guidance for the year is a nice display of our confidence in our ability to deliver this year, next
year and beyond. The diversity of opportunity resident in our portfolio really does make a difference in our ability to
outperform. Our opportunities far outweigh any risks we deal with and we're actually pretty excited about where we're
going. So thanks for listening. Bye-bye.
Operator
Thank you. And this does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a
