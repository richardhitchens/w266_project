Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Trey, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by sharing some highlights about how Baker Hughes
performed during the third quarter. Today, we reported record revenue of $5.8 billion, an increase of more than 5%
over the previous quarter, with record revenue in the United States, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Africa, Russia
Caspian, and our Industrial segment. We're particularly pleased with the results of our Eastern Hemisphere operations
where our core business in the North Sea remains strong and we are seeing solid growth in the Middle East, Africa,
Russia and the Caspian.
In addition to top line growth, we remain committed to improving the quality of our earnings. In Asia Pacific, we
repositioned our business to capture profitable growth in key markets, such as China and Southeast Asia, resulting in
strong margins from this region. In North America, we continued to execute our plan to improve operating efficiencies
in our U.S. Pressure Pumping business, resulting in higher profitability for the third consecutive quarter. Also during
the quarter, we continued the restructuring of our Latin American operation to better align with recent activity declines
in Brazil and Mexico leading to improved profitability.
Our growth in earnings, along with a disciplined approach to capital allocation and ongoing initiatives to reduce
working capital, generated an increase in free cash flow for the quarter. Later in today's call, I'll share a few examples
of the products and services we are commercializing today that will shape the economics of tomorrow's oil and gas
production and contribute to future earnings growth.
But first, let me turn it over to Peter for additional details on the quarter and our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Peter?
Peter A. Ragauss
Thanks, Martin, and good morning. Today, we reported adjusted net income for the third quarter of $358 million, or
$0.81 per share, up $0.27 per share sequentially. Adjusted net income excludes a $17 million after-tax severance
charge, or $0.04 per share related to restructuring in our Latin American operation. However, adjusted net income
includes a $42 million, or $0.09 per share, after-tax reserve for bad debt in Latin America.
On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to Baker Hughes for the third quarter was $341 million, or $0.77 per share.
Revenue for the third quarter was $5.8 billion, as Martin mentioned, a record for Baker Hughes, which is up $300
million, or 5.5%, compared to the previous quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue was up $432
million, or 8.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $1 billion, up 18.4% sequentially.
To help in your understanding of the quarter's results, I'll bridge last quarter's earnings per share to this quarter. In the
second quarter, we posted GAAP net income of $0.54 per share. First, add back $0.07 for bad debt reserves and in
inventory charges, which were highlighted in the second quarter.
Next, add $0.10 for North America operations, driven primarily by the seasonal rebound of Canadian activity. Add
another $0.10 for Eastern Hemisphere operations where typical seasonal declines in Europe were more than offset by
strong performance in every other region. Add $0.06 for Latin America as our actions to improve profitability are being
executed as planned. And add $0.03 for lower taxes and other expenses. At this point, our earnings per share would
have been $0.90.
Next, subtract $0.09 for the $42 million reserve for bad debt in Latin America. That brings us to adjusted earnings per
share of $0.81 this quarter. To get the GAAP earnings per share of $0.77, subtract another $0.04 for $17 million in
after-tax severance cost in Latin America.
In Table 5 of our earnings release, we provide adjusted financial information excluding the impact of the restructuring
cost in Latin America. From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit and
operating profit margin refer explicitly to Table 5 in our earnings release unless otherwise stated.

Taking a closer look at our results from operations, revenue in North America was $2.9 billion, up $177 million, or
6.6% sequentially. North America operating profit was $295 million, or 10.3% for the quarter, up $84 million, or 245
basis points sequentially. This growth was achieved primarily due to the seasonal recovery in Canada tempered by
flooding in Alberta early in the quarter. Across North America, we saw record revenue for our Drilling Services,
Completion Systems, Artificial Lift, and Upstream Chemicals product lines.
Additionally, we saw continued improvement in our U.S. Pressure Pumping business, where ongoing efforts to
optimize asset utilization and well site efficiency continue. In the Gulf of Mexico, revenue declined slightly due to
seasonal activity reductions during the hurricane season. The decline in activity was partially offset by a favorable mix
of sales, including strong adoption of newly introduced wireline technologies for a number of deepwater clients.
Moving to international results, we posted record revenue of $2.6 billion, up $111 million, or 4.5% versus the prior
quarter, and up $312 million, or 13.6% compared to a year ago. Excluding severance costs and bad debt reserves in
Latin America, international operating profit amounted to a record $364 million, up $96 million, or 36% sequentially.
In the Eastern Hemisphere, we posted record revenue of $2 billion, a 6% increase sequentially and a 20% increase
compared to the third quarter of last year. Profit margins increased 220 basis points sequentially and 450 basis points
over last year to 15.9%, resulting in record operating profit of $326 million.
Our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment led this growth with record revenue and operating profit for the quarter. This
record performance can be attributed to share gains and increased activity for drilling services in China, Southeast Asia
and the Arabian Gulf. Additionally, we benefited from the early delivery of specialized Completion Systems in this
segment, the type of product sales we would normally expect in the fourth quarter.
Elsewhere in the Eastern Hemisphere, Russia Caspian delivered record revenue and operating profit for the quarter as a
result of strong Completions product sales and continued growth in the Drilling Services.
Africa also saw good results, primarily driven by strong drill bit sales in North Africa and increased Completion
Systems and Pressure Pumping activity in Nigeria.
In Latin America, restructuring of our business to match current market conditions continued during the third quarter.
Excluding these costs and the reserves for bad debt, Latin America operating profit margins were 6.9%.
For our Industrial Services segment, we posted record revenue of $328 million, up $12 million sequentially. Operating
profit was $38 million and operating profit margin was 11.6%. Increased revenues were primarily due to higher activity
in our Downstream Chemicals business.
Looking at the balance sheet, during the quarter, we generated $662 million of free cash flow and ended the quarter
with a cash balance of $1.4 billion, or a $245 million increase sequentially. Total debt decreased $334 million during
the quarter to $4.6 billion.
Currently, our total debt to capital ratio is 20.3%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $511 million, a reduction of
$40 million compared to the second quarter.
Now, let me provide you with our guidance for the fourth quarter. In the U.S., we project average rig and well counts to
decline approximately 2.5% in the fourth quarter due to typical seasonal slowdowns around the holiday period. This is
in contrast to last year's pronounced decline in rig count and well count of more than 5%. We anticipate that the fourth
quarter onshore rig count for the U.S. will average 1,660 rigs, comprised of 1,320 oil rigs and 340 gas rigs. This
represents a decrease of about 45 rigs from the Q3 average and 25 rigs from our latest weekly rig count.
The forecast for U.S. offshore rigs in the fourth quarter includes 58 active rigs, which remains unchanged from the third
quarter. Total average annual U.S. rig count for 2013 is now projected to be 1,750 rigs, which represents a 9%
reduction compared to 2012. However, based on the Baker Hughes' well count, which was published last week, we
estimate that the U.S. industry is now drilling about 6% more wells per rig compared to 2012. Therefore, the U.S.
onshore well count is expected to only decline 3% compared to 2012.

In Canada, the projected average rig count in the fourth quarter is 400 rigs. As a result, Canada's average annual rig
count is now expected to be about 360 rigs, or a 2% decrease compared to 2012. Sequentially, we expect Q4 North
America revenues and profit margins will continue to improve. Slightly higher activity levels in Canada and improved
operational efficiencies in our U.S. Pressure Pumping business are expected to more than offset the 2.5% decline in
U.S. onshore activity during the quarter. Gulf of Mexico activity should remain strong aside from a one-week delay in
activity due to Tropical Storm Karen earlier this month.
Looking internationally, the rig count is anticipated to resume growth after recent declines in the third quarter to an
average 2013 rig count of about 1,300 rigs with the largest growth coming from Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
Excluding Iraq and Syria, this represents a 5% increase in the annual international rig count. Regarding our
international margins, we expect that our Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian segment revenue and margins should increase
modestly in Q4 driven by stable activity and an increase in product sales typically experienced late in the quarter.
As previously mentioned, our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment benefited in the third quarter from a large product
delivery, which will not repeat in the fourth quarter. As a result, we do not project year-end product sales in this
segment to increase sequentially as in years past. Therefore, we forecast revenues and margins to be flat to slightly up
for the fourth quarter.
And in Latin America, our fourth quarter guidance remains unchanged. Through efforts we are taking to restructure our
business, margins should continue increasing to high-single digits by year's end. Industrial Services activity is expected
to drop in the fourth quarter due to typical seasonal declines in our Process and Pipeline Services business, with results
expected to look similar to the fourth quarter of last year.
Also for the fourth quarter, interest expense is expected to be around $60 million; corporate costs are expected to be
about $70 million; depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be around $430 million; capital expenditures
for the quarter are expected to be about $500 million; and finally, our 2013 full-year effective tax rate is expected to be
between 33% and 34%.
At this point, I will now turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Peter. Looking ahead, we remain focused on achieving long-term profitable growth by leveraging our culture
of innovation. We continue to see strong demand for Baker Hughes' products and services on the world's most
challenging oil and gas projects. From ultra deepwater exploration to field management of mature assets, our operations
are growing around the world.
In Russia Caspian, for example, we have diversified our business to include both high-end product sales and a steady
service business. Starting with the foundation of Completions and Artificial Lift sales, we are expanding our Drilling
and Evaluation service lines. Today, we are providing Drilling Services on the highest number of rigs in the history of
our Russia Caspian region.
In Asia Pacific, our strategy to grow margins by focusing on key product lines in growing markets is paying off. And
we intend to continue this momentum by targeting and winning work aligned to our strengths in this region.
In Malaysia and Vietnam, we've grown our Drilling Services business and expanded Wireline Services to include high
pressure, high temperature capabilities. In China, sales of our Artificial Lift and drill bits continues to grow. In
Australia, our Wireline Services and Completion Systems businesses are expanding based on recent contract awards.
And today, I'm pleased to announce that Baker Hughes and Petronas Carigali have entered into a long-term oil field
services agreement to enhance recoverable reserves and production of hydrocarbons in the greater D18 field. This
23-year agreement is a result of a successful field development study and production enhancement campaign by our
Reservoir Development Services and Integrated Operations groups. Beginning in the fourth quarter, this award will
support continued growth in the region and complements our growing position in field management projects around the

world.
In Africa, we are seeing profitable growth across all product lines. In North Africa, we've seen a strong increase in drill
bit sales following a newly-won contract. And during the third quarter, we won a major three-year tender in Algeria to
provide Wireline Services. And in East Africa, we are mobilizing into Kenya to provide Wireline Services, Pressure
Pumping, Completion Systems, and drill bits for a series of contracts over the next three years.
In Latin America, we are targeting and winning work, which matches our strengths in well construction, well
production and field management.
In the third quarter, we were awarded a multi-year contract in Brazil to provide offshore well stimulation services. With
this award, Baker Hughes will operate half the stimulation vessels currently in country, giving us a strong share
position in this key deepwater market. Also in Brazil, we were awarded multi-year contracts for Artificial Lift and
Intelligent Production Systems.
And in Mexico, we were awarded a multi-year contract to supply high pressure, high temperature Completion Systems,
expanding our position in the southern area of this country. This complements our recent win in Northern Mexico to
provide Field Management Services on the Soledad block beginning early next year.
Overall, international operations are trending in the right direction and are expected to continue solid profitable growth
in 2014 as recent contract wins take hold and the demand for high-end technology products and services continues to
grow.
Now, turning to North America, as Peter mentioned, we continue to see record revenue across many of our product
lines, even though market activity is down compared to last year. This success can be attributed to the innovative
products and services that Baker Hughes has introduced, which meaningfully improve the efficiency and economics of
well construction and production for our customers.
A good example is our Rhino Bifuel stimulation technology used in Pressure Pumping. This technology substitutes up
to 70% of diesel with cleaner burning natural gas. Demand for this service has exceeded our expectations, and to date,
we've completed several dozen wells in several hundred stages with full fleets of Rhino Bifuel using LNG transported
to location.
And during the third quarter, we achieved a significant milestone, fracking our first series of wells using line gas from
the field, including 240 stages over 18 different wells in the Northeast and the Rockies. The use of line gas on these
projects displaced more than 100,000 gallons of diesel. In addition to reducing emissions, it also eliminated several
shipments of fuel to rural areas, achieving significant cost savings.
We're also making strategic investments to improve sustainability. Baker Hughes is an established leader in water
management and demand for our H2prO service is building momentum across a number of basins, including the
Permian, the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford. In September, we achieved a significant milestone by treating 5 million
barrels of produced water in a single month for the first time ever.
Strength in water management is also helping us to differentiate our Pressure Pumping business. This quarter, we
successfully performed a hydraulic fracture stimulation in the Permian basin using 100% produced water. On this
single project, H2prO technology prevented the consumption of more than 2 million gallons of potable water.
Turning to the Gulf of Mexico, we are helping our customers push limits in search of the great next discovery. During
the quarter, we drilled the deepest well in the history of the Gulf of Mexico to a depth of 36,552 feet. Achieving this
record required operating in extreme pressures over 30,000 psi and underscores our role as a leading provider of
Drilling Services in the U.S. offshore market.
Around the world, we are leveraging our strength in technology development to drive growth and profitability. Today,
we continue to accelerate the pace of innovation by developing technologies to specifically address three of the
industry's key challenges: increasing well complexity, optimizing drilling efficiency and improving ultimate recovery.

Early this month, we announced the revolutionary new StayCool multidimensional cutter. This latest advancement in
drill bit technology enables operators to drill faster and more cost effectively by extending the cutter life in the footage
per run, especially in difficult drilling environments. StayCool cutters have already drilled more than 300,000 feet in 90
runs for more than 20 customers throughout the U.S. In the Cana Woodford field of Oklahoma, this technology
provided customers with a 10% improvement in the rate of penetration and a 37% improvement in total footage when
drilling through hard interbedded formations.
We're also seeing positive test results with our new FASTrak Logging-While-Drilling fluid sampling and formation
pressure testing service. Although still in the initial phase of commercialization, FASTrak is already building a
significant track record worldwide. This technology is helping customers improve their understanding of the reservoir's
potential by capturing high-purity fluid samples while drilling.
During the third quarter, FASTrak was successfully deployed in the U.K., the Gulf of Mexico, Australia and the UAE
with results exceeding expectations.
Now on our last earnings call, we told you about a new breakthrough in artificial lift technology, our FLEX series
electrical submersible pumps. FLEX pumps are designed to boost production across a wide range of flow rates,
including low flow applications historically serviced by simple rod lift technology. This quarter, we officially launched
ProductionWave, a comprehensive suite of products and services specifically tailored towards production optimization
in the unconventional market.
ProductionWave solutions include combinations of FLEX pump technology, sand control products, chemical injection
systems and real-time monitoring services, providing our customers with new field development options to address the
specific challenges of low flow ranges, high gas production and the typical paraffin scale and frac sand production
associated with unconventionals.
In addition to achieving increased production rates in some case by as much as 35%, our customers are benefiting from
lower installation and maintenance costs when compared to other artificial lift systems.
ProductionWave and FLEX pump technology are already gaining traction in the U.S. unconventional market. In the
very brief time since launch, we've installed 46 FLEX pumps in low-flow wells where rod lift had previously been the
only artificial lift option.
Also during the third quarter, we signed a software license and joint product development agreement with Shell to
develop a high-end capability for geological and reservoir modeling using our JewelEarth platform. This software
platform will bring enhanced evaluation and visualization capabilities to Shell, allowing geoscience and petroleum
engineering experts to better plan and manage the extraction of oil and gas resources.
We're also investing in solutions to improve our understanding of the reservoir to increase recovery from fractured
zones. This quarter, we strengthened our business alliance with CGG through a newly-chartered joint venture called
Magnitude. This joint venture will focus on surface and borehole microseismic monitoring, processing, visualization
and interpretation. The alliance will enhance the capabilities of Baker Hughes and CGG in the unconventional resource
plays and other emerging markets.
The challenges and complexities faced by our customers are driving a new wave of innovation at Baker Hughes. The
technologies and business relationships I highlighted today are a sample of the solutions we are bringing to market,
solutions that will deliver long-term profitable growth for Baker Hughes. And at the same time, and as I've said before,
we remain focused on our priorities of increasing the quality of our earnings, remaining capital disciplined and
generating free cash flow.
And with that, Trey, let's turn it over for some questions.

Thank you, Martin. At this point, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for your questions. To give everyone a fair
chance to ask questions, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and one related follow-up.
Lorraine, could we have the first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes
from Byron Pope from Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.
<Q - Byron Pope>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Byron.
<Q - Byron Pope>: Martin, I just wanted to see if you could touch on how the recent changes to the ONE Baker
Hughes matrix organization has applications for how you improve margins and efficiency in your regions going
forward.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Sure, Byron. Well, look, when we did this about four and a half years ago, the
organization, there were lot of [ph] span and (24:39) control issues with particularly the hemispheres, as well as the
density of the regions. If you remember as well, I think we started with something like 23 geo-markets, quickly moved
a year or so, two years later, into 19.
So it was never a plan, I think, that we would go long-term with some of the structure we had. It was a security blanket
to a degree. So I've been very impressed over the last several quarters with the maturity of the geo-markets in terms of
the capabilities and the talent, the systems in place, the rigor by which they move to managing their business, their
focus on the results. And it was time, I think, to delayer a bit, so that's the first thing.
The second thing I wanted to get a little closer myself to the operation, which the de-layering allowed. So I think going
forward, it would give us a better opportunity to execute more reliably and keep a lean business profile. So that's kind
of the motivation. But like I say, it was always part of a longer-term plan. And we're always looking to optimize the
business, right. We've got a lot of great people, and we want to put some talent into some jobs, and so time was right
and we feel very, very good about it.
<Q - Byron Pope>: Okay. Thank you. And then just one quick question on North America. You mentioned this was
the third straight quarter that you saw improvement in the Pressure Pumping business. And as we think about the
margin progression for that region as we get into 2014, is it fair to think that the margins for the Pressure Pumping
service line are starting to get close to the region average? Or is it still a ways to go there?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Look, you're right. It's getting better. But there continues to be a wide margin between
that particular product line and our overall results, let alone the other product lines.
<Q - Byron Pope>: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

And our next question comes from James West from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Hey. Good morning, Martin, Peter, Trey.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, James.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Martin, on the international side of the business, obviously good steady progress here has
been made in the third quarter, and Peter went through kind of the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about 2014? I
know you said it would be a strong year of growth given project startups and contract wins. I think some of them,
ourselves included, have been pegging growth somewhere in the 10%-type range for E&P spending. Is that consistent
kind of with your view? I don't want to pin a number down on you, but is that that type of growth what you guys kind
of see?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes. I think 10% is reasonable. And I'd also add to that maybe back to the earlier
comments I was making to Byron, for us, executing on that 10% and maximizing the value, I think, is going to be better
than it's been in the past. And the appetite for technology in that 10%, given where it's at internationally, is going to be
very, very strong.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Good. Good. That's what we're seeing as well. The North American business, just a quick
follow-up for me, a similar type question but really more Baker Hughes-specific. I mean, you highlighted a number of
new technologies. We're hearing data points that are kind of unbelievable about number of wells being drilled per pad,
et cetera, and just kind of service intensity of wells just continuing to increase in here. And a lot of that is your
technologies being absorbed. Do you think that your growth in North America, both top line and then, of course,
margin, I guess there'll be some of that that's a little bit of repair of Pressure Pumping. But do you think share growth is
more of just market share gain through technology adoption? Or do you think the market itself will grow next year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I think the market's going to grow. I think you guys, as well as few of your peers,
have put out there that spending will likely be up given the buoyant commodity prices and cash flow our customers
have.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Sure.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I'm not suggesting they're going to completely lose discipline. I think they're going to be
very, very prudent. But there is an increasing appetite for technology. The heat's on in terms of getting the EURs up,
getting the initial production rates up, getting those – squeezing out incremental efficiencies per pad. I mean, the pad's a
big move, but to pad alone without the bottom hole assemblies doesn't make a difference.
So it really – the whole combination falls under our wheelhouse very well, James. So we're confident in North
America. I think it's going to be, though, going forward an increasing conversation with the customer community
around technology. And even things like bifuel or dry-on-the-fly or you name it, they just need to keep solving these
problems. And it's good; it's good for us.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Right. And do you think that you can outgrow the overall market growth then because of
that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, I think so. I mean, if you look at what we've done in the last couple quarters
sequentially in North America in terms of revenues, I would fully expect that we'd outgrow the overall market, yes.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay, great. Thanks, Martin.

<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Thanks, good morning. Martin, back to international, if you were to, at this juncture, looking
into 2014, highlight what you would expect to be the five key growth markets for Baker Hughes in 2014, what would
those be?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Five?
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Well...
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We only have like three international...
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: It could be 10 if you want.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We only three international segments. But I know what you mean.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Well, countries, of course.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Sure, sure, sure. Let me start with the one that we're probably seeing the most buoyancy
in, and that would be Africa. And just walk around the outer ring, right?
I think the pre-salts out of Brazil are going to be very, very strong. We've already seen some geological success for our
customers. And just like in Brazil, the drilling and sub-surface technology's going to be in high demand. So that part of
the world. Move down around the Horn and I think East Africa is going to drive the numbers in 2014.
Middle East is going to be exceptionally strong year-on-year led by Saudi, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi. We'll see margin
progression in Iraq and continued top line growth. And given the amount of revenue that's there, you can't avoid it in
terms of where the top line growth comes from overall.
The North Sea will be steady, so I wouldn't put it in there as a top-five contender in terms of difference – in terms of
delta. I don't see it necessarily being able to achieve that. Russia would be up there on the list. I don't know how many
I've mentioned, but...
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: What about Mexico? With these large tenders out there, are you optimistic about that or no?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No, I am optimistic. I think there will be a degree of caution. There's been some
challenges – payment challenges in the North that we've all experienced. I think there's still a lot of debate with regards
to the new petroleum law. And I think some of it'll be resolved before the end of the year, but I don't see the big issue
with our customers in terms of ownership versus profit sharing being resolved any time, frankly, next year.
So I think it'll definitely be up year-on-year. That would be my expectation. But I think I'd temper a bit the – some of
the euphoria around Mexico.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Right. I guess the thing about Mexico is that the tenders are out there, the $8 billion
thereabouts, they don't have that much to do with the constitutional reforms, but they're just, I mean, tenders for
essentially [indiscernible] (33:04).
<A>: [indiscernible] (33:04)
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's right.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay. Good. And then secondly, what, at this juncture, could you hazard a guess as from a
Baker Hughes standpoint how oversupplied the frac market is domestically? And what kind of well count growth do we
need to see in order for the market to become more balanced and even to drive pricing leverage for the service
providers?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay. So, our estimate – it's still a sloppy market, of course. We'd say it probably hasn't
changed, say, 20%...

<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: ...oversupplied. And in terms of the well count, as you know, Bill, there's so many
variables. I mean, there's lateral length. There's number of stages in addition to the well count. But then offsetting that
is as I look at our numbers, our own improving efficiency. So we're getting more sand pumped with – on a per
horsepower basis than we did this time last year, and we fully expect to even get better at it.
So the well count alone isn't the only solution, so I'd hazard to guess how many wells are going to – how much well
count's going to have to go up. I'm not smart enough to figure that out, Bill, not at this stage.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay, fair point. Peter, last one from me with regard to – I know you're probably still
formulating your plans for 2014, but I'm just – if you could hazard a guess with regard to capital spending outlook for
next year. Is it up? Is it flat? Or even down, frankly? And also, the free cash flow generation for next year looks to be
considerably higher, and any thoughts with regard to how that may come back to shareholders in one form or fashion?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, sure, Bill. Well, we're pretty pleased with what we've been able to do this year on cash
flow.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Right.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: And a lot of that – we've driven higher revenue. The first nine months, I think, it's $500
million over last year with lower CapEx. And so our capital discipline is working. And we expect to continue that
capital discipline into 2014. Certainly in the first half of 2014, CapEx will be at the current run rate.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Depending on market conditions, if we need more tools, we'll then start gearing up. But right
now, it doesn't feel like we need more tools because we've been able to prove that we've been able to keep the tool
spend steady and grow revenue. So that's good.
As far as cash flow and working capital, that sort of thing, yeah, we had a great quarter this quarter. I'm very pleased
with our team's ability to manage working capital despite revenue going up. I think we got more to do there into 2014,
so that should help cash flow incrementally, 2014 versus 2013. So, yeah, we think this quarter, next quarter, next year,
cash flow should continue to increase.
And with respect to uses, it's still something we debate and discuss with the board every quarter. And the good news is
we've got a lot more to talk about now.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay, thanks very much.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks, good morning. Peter, I was curious just as it relates to the Latin America margin
outlook here. You basically are affirming your second quarter guidance with regard to a high-single digit, yet you
showed pretty appreciable improvement in 3Q as we back out some of the charge-offs and the write-down, the bad
debt. What is driving the margin improvement, I guess, for 4Q at this point? Is it still just realization of that cost
rationalization? Is there still product sales we're anticipating here in 4Q moving margins up?
And then, I guess, just how do we think about typically what would be, I guess, assuming product sales in 4Q then
going away 1Q, how we look at margin in Latin America for first quarter?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Well, I think you've [ph] cited (37:11) two of them. We had some one-off costs in Q2 that
did not repeat in Q3. So that was helpful in Q3. We also had some labor savings in Q3, which we'll have more of in Q4.

So that's the good part. We do have some new contracts in the Andean and Mexico that'll help offset what's been going
on in Brazil and Chicontepec areas. So it's a little bit of mix, a little bit of activity, and a little bit of cost savings going
into Q4.
As far as Q1, well, and we will probably have a little bit more product sales in Q4 as well, so sort of all of the above.
Not each of which is in huge amounts, but when they add up, they'll be accretive. Q1, yeah, you probably will have the
typical sell-off in product sales relative to Q4.
<Q - William Sanchez>: I mean, do you all feel like that the charge-offs that you've had here the last few quarters are
essentially done in Latin America now?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: We certainly had a sizable amount in Q3. We continue to look at the business every quarter
and we'll decide during the quarter based on conditions in contracts what we'll do next.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. Martin, my follow up for you, just back on the North America market. I know the 10%
bogey I think was an important number for your guys here in 3Q in terms of the margin. I'm trying to just get a sense.
Clearly, there's been a lot around Baker with the self-help opportunities you've had on the margin side in North
America and you've talked about in the past the move to the 24/7 crews and what that's doing. And then the logistics
cleanup that you guys have had to kind of embark upon. And then some of the field level cost savings which you
touched on today around the bifuel fleets and I know some of the slurry mixing and things like that.
Can you just give us a sense of kind of where we are in kind of each of these three things in terms of how much of the
margin appreciation have you realized from these, kind of where we are?
And I guess if you could clarify, too, I think there had been some, maybe, confusion with regard to your 24/7 crews.
What percentage were actually working on 24/7? And what were kind of capable of working on 24/7? I know there had
been numbers out there. You were looking at, at least a 50% exit rate at 24/7. Just if you'd clarify, is that capable of
working 24/7? Or is that you actually see your crews being 50% employed on 24/7 by year-end?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Sure, Bill. Let me start with the final part. Right now, 50% of the fleets we have in the
U.S. are 24-hour capable. And by far, those are the fleets that work the most hours on any given week, so that the
utilization is the highest with the 24 hours. We expect to be, this time next year, far higher than we are today with
24-hour capability.
As far as the initiatives that were underway, the big one being supply chain, and all that it encompasses, particularly
logistics and procurements and R&M, I'd say that we're probably second base in the time to improvement in that
particular space is a little bit lengthier than, let's say, some of the early wins we had in some of the other areas, like for
example, converting to 24-hour fleet.
Efficiency gains with the fleet in other ways, making sure it's in the right markets is, I think, essentially complete.
Another component which you didn't mention but was a big driver for us year-on-year was the customer mix, Bill. And
again, there I'd say we're probably, again, to stay with the baseball analogy, say between second and third base.
You can always do a better job of not only high-grading your mix but working with the customer to make sure that
they're being more efficient. So we've made good improvements there. I think if you look at our top-20 list, it reflects a
big percentage of the U.S.'s leading clients in the space with regards to pad drilling and understanding the subsurface
and having the rig count to keep our fleet active.
So somewhere around second base. And in terms of margin progression, as I think I highlighted on a previous question,
still a very, very large gap between that particular product line, which is our largest in North America, and our other
business lines. I think, as we said in our prepared remarks, record revenues for many of the other product lines. And
what we didn't say, but if you remember, whether it was Chemicals or Artificial Lift or Completions, we had records in
those last quarter. So two quarters in a row with some of these product lines.
So we still have a lot of opportunity and I would expect that Q4 will be better than Q3, and Q1 will be better than Q4
and every quarter going forward, of course, with the Q2 normal hiccup in Canada. So I hope that answers your

question.
<Q - William Sanchez>: You know, Martin, I guess, assuming you get to home plate on these initiatives, can you
quantify for us which remaining – assuming pricing and stem stays where it is, and the operational top line trends stay
the same, is it possible to quantify what kind of basis point ramp you would see once you kind of deliver?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: It's definitely possible to quantify, Bill. We have a plan to get to the mid-high teens, but
I'm not going to give any more specificity than that.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. One last one for me. Did the third Gulf of Mexico stim vessel makes its way into the
fleet here by quarter's end?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: It's in this quarter, it's mobilizing this month.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. Great. Thank you for the time.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Martin, I was just wondering if you could stick on that same question about the offshore stim
market. Things do look like things are starting to pick up lower tertiary development. I was just wondering if you have
had any discussions internally about adding more stim vessels or how you see that market playing out. Is there any
thoughts to that right now?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's kind of a touchy area in terms of the amount of capacity the market can take. We
have a new boat and it's mobilizing or it's arrived in the North Sea called the Blue Orca, which is kind of a copy of the
ships that we have here in the Gulf of Mexico, 300-footer. And it should be active. And then this recent add in the Gulf,
we have no other plans, but I think Peter did mention that we recently won two additional boats, renewals, in Brazil. So
it's a market that's got to be very well looked after because we don't want to have any spare capacity just given the pain
that that can cause. So we're pretty comfortable with what we have right now in terms of floating capacity.
<Q - David Anderson>: And obviously, you're going to be thinking about your CapEx spend for next year. Are you
guys thinking – Peter, are you thinking about kind of your CapEx for next year? Can you give us any indications as
kind of what you're thinking? Is it going to be flat? Do you think slightly up, slightly down? Any help on there?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: It's going to be flat through the first half and then we'll see how market conditions evolve.
And if all of you guys' predictions are right with double-digit customer spend, then we may have to spend a little bit
more in the second half. But we haven't made that determination yet.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. And just one last quick one on Latin America. I know you had talked about kind of the
progression of margins. I'm just wondering about kind of the mobilization and de-mobilization that's been impacting
some of the numbers. I guess just first of all, are you completely demobilized out of Brazil? Have you right-sized that
business?
And the second question I think is a little bit more important is on Mexico. I mean, is this a market that you add
capacity now in front of these contracts? I know you have one of the incentive contracts starts up, I believe, in
February. And then these mega tenders, I think those start up in April, yet work has stopped right now. How do you
think about that business and kind of positioning yourself for the next couple years?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay. So let's start with Brazil. Substantial amount of the demobilization took place in
Q3. And as far as Mexico, I think as I highlighted to Bill earlier, Dave, this – we've got to wait and see how these IO
tenders unfold, where they are. A lot of them are offshore; a lot of them are in the South; some of them are in the North.
I've got some concerns personally about those IOs actually getting issued and executed in the North given what

transpired this year.
So we'll mobilize according to how we normally do. We'll look at the terms of the contract. We'll see how diligent the
customer is and be prepared to execute the work. We're pretty good at that. I'm not worried about any kind of stumbles
when it comes to mobilizing for those projects.
<Q - David Anderson>: Well, is it fair to say some of this equipment kind of floating around in kind of Latin America
will hang on margins for a bit and then maybe kind of this time next year, we should eliminate all those overhangs?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We don't have much spare equipment hanging around anywhere. A lot of the Brazil
equipment went outside of the continent and it's working. So these projects in Mexico come to be, it'll further stretch
resources. And maybe, as Peter highlighted, we'll have to get the machine shops working on overtime. We'll have to
look at it when it happens.
<Q - David Anderson>: Great. Let's hope so. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning.
<Q - Brad Handler>: If I come back to U.S. Pumping too, but maybe slightly differently, I'm curious for your reaction
to what sounds like it may be a trend, but that's part of the question; Whiting and Continental are talking about moving
away from sliding sleeve and seeming to prefer plug and perf up in their Bakken completions. I guess, are you seeing
that more than you were before? Does it seem as though sliding sleeve is actually losing traction? And how does that
affect your business if it's true?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, Brad, I'll tell you this. The experimentation that occurs within the customer
community in the unconventionals is as rampant as it's ever been. It's probably going to continue. We love that. I mean,
we've got a very broad portfolio of Completion Systems. Plug and perf is a good business. We're in the plug business.
We're in the perforating business. Some customers try one thing, and I got to tell you, they go right back to something
else.
I think at the end of the day, depending on the particular reservoir, where they're at in that reservoir, they will be sliding
sleeve technology forever. It makes sense. There may be some places where it doesn't work. And don't forget the fact
that sliding sleeve, almost every couple of quarters, we're launching a whole new derivation of it from where we were
three years ago.
So we're not in the least bit worried. It's a market ripe for innovation, and our people are very, very good at that. So
whatever customer wants to – like I say, if they want to experiment, we're the right ones to help them with it. But again,
our Completions business had another record quarter, and it doesn't include the plug and perf segment. So we're pretty
happy with the way it's going.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay. Martin, that's helpful context. I appreciate that. Maybe an unrelated follow up,
presumably for Pete. Trying to think about that the debt write-offs here, I know you had a more significant one in Q4 of
last year, and then I guess there was a little bit in Q2, and then again in Q3. Maybe, I guess, in a sense, what is it – what
is it saying to us? And how should we be thinking about – if I wanted to have a – as a recurring risk just because of
your policy if nothing else, is there something that flows through the model going forward just almost as a safety
measure?
And then maybe the other way of asking it is, have you had some recoveries that perhaps we're not seeing relative to
the bad debt, say, from the fourth quarter of last year.

<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: So first of all, let me just talk about this quarter. We had more than one customer this quarter,
but they're both in Latin America. One is the typical slow payment; the other is their financial condition. But you're
right. We've been applying the same policies consistently over the years. I mean it's been awhile and it's a conservative
approach. I think it's fully transparent. Others in the industry have the same issues, but they're not taking the same
accounting approach, so that's interesting in and of itself.
But I would say we have not been in Latin America collecting – we haven't had quarters where we've collected and not
told you because we haven't been collecting above sort of what we expected. But if we did, we would probably break it
out if it were material. So I think it's – and essentially, over the years, we've reserved quite a bit in Latin America, so
the accounting risk and the financial risk is a lot lower than somebody else who maybe have it all on the balance sheet.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Brad, let me add one thing to that. I wouldn't tell you that – we still fully expect to collect
every dollar we have legitimately earned. This is an accounting approach that we feel very strongly about and that we
follow our rules and we've been open straight with that. But we expect to collect every nickel, and when we do, if it
needs to be broken out, we'll break it out.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Right. Right. Well, all right, very good. Obviously look forward to seeing that day. Thanks,
guys. I'll turn it back.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Hey, Kurt.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, Martin, I just wanted to see if you could give a little bit more color around the semantics
used? When you talk about 50% of your frac crews are 24-hour capable, I think some of the benchmarks that have been
discussed in the past were, I think, more directly related to how many of your frac crews are actually contracted for
24/7 operations.
And I think, in the past, at least I had the impression that your target was about 70% of your frac fleet were to be
contracted on a 24/7 ops. So I just wondered if you might be able to provide some clarity or differentiation between
50% 24-hour capable versus what percent of your actual fleets are running 24/7 ops on a contract basis right now.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, okay. So I'm not sure I'm going to be able to answer your – I'm not going to –
probably choose here not to give you what you're going to want to hear. We're 50% capable. I hope to be about 70%
capable this time next year in terms of what's fitted out to be 24 hours. And as I said earlier, all I'm going to say is that
the 24-hour fleets are working more than the non 24-hour fleets, as you would expect. What percentage of that? It
depends on the basin, something we work closely. Obviously, they're not anywhere close to 100% utilized, nor is any –
even of the conventional fleets. So that's about the extent I'm going to be able to provide color for you, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Maybe just in the context then of your comment about 50% capable; what makes a frac fleet
24-hour capable? And if you're going to go from 50% of your frac fleet that's 24-hour capable to 70%, what is the
dynamic that's going to drive that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: There's two key drivers. One, you have to have a workforce and a work program to be
able to keep the fleet going. Two, you have to have a customer structure that allows that fleet to be able to work at that
high intensity. And then, third, you have to have the supply chain, which is both infrastructure and R&M and just
overall logistics that can keep that fleet on location and working. And what I mean by the supply chain, it also includes,
obviously, being able to pull equipment off location and maintain it at a nearby infrastructure to where then you can
mobilize it back out.

So if you were to look at the fleet, it doesn't look any different. It's really, if you would, everything in the background
that allows that fleet to keep working, starting with labor and the customer, and then the supply chain.

Thank you. And our last question will come from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Yeah, thanks a lot. Martin, so in this backdrop of relatively steady but slow by historic standards
spending growth, you highlight kind of your biggest areas of top line excitement. But where do you see the biggest
improvements for Baker Hughes to normalize margins just by being more efficient and rational with the bidding
strategies and contracts? And what should those sort of new normal margins be? And also where would it be the
hardest to get to kind of what you would view as a normal level?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I think my expectations are that all of our four geographical segments will continue
to improve their margins. And if you look on a relative basis, Latin America will – should be driven by further
efficiency gains and productivity gains in Brazil. And given what actually materializes in Mexico, should be pretty
good for the overall industry.
North America, we obviously still have a lot of work to do in one particular product line. And given the rollout of the
technology, whether it's on the Pressure Pumping side, the AutoTrak Curve side or the Artificial Lift side with the
ProductionWave, I expect margins there will definitely track north.
I think the Europe, North Sea area will be steady. It's already one of our leading margin areas. I think activity will be
strong, but I don't think activity will drive price there. I think it'll be more of a technology play. I do think you're going
to see some price traction as a result of activity in the Middle East. And as I highlighted earlier, only Africa is probably
one of the areas for us, both because of the increasing rig count that we see going forward, but also the technology
plays and the demands for our kind of products is what's – it gives me a whole lot of optimism and confidence that
that'll be one of our leading margin areas in 2014.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: And Ole, this is Peter. We've recently demonstrated in Asia Pacific a big turnaround. It used
to be a lagger in terms of margins. But this quarter, it's no longer a lagger; the delta in Asia Pacific was very strong this
quarter. And as you talked about intelligent bidding and this and that, well, we've done that. It's taken us a while, but
we're seeing the fruits of it, particularly this quarter, and we're very proud of that region.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: So back to Latin America again. What could those margins go to, again, by rationalizing your
business? And it sounds like – I mean, congratulations [ph] for not (57:43) winning that latest directional drilling
contract in Brazil. But with the reorgs through and business normalizing and smart bidding, as you highlighted, what
would a normal margin be for you guys in Latin America?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Ole, I'm not going to predict the margin. I'm going to just tell you that it's going to be up
from here on out. And as Peter said, there's still some rationalizations, some smarter contracts to improve our mix. I'm
not going to give you a prediction on what that margin's going to be in Latin America.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. Fair enough. Back to North America, again, on Pressure Pumping. You highlighted the
new technology is also making your frac fleet more efficient, 20% overcapacity. How do you view the industry-wide
efficiency gains relative to the current overcapacity in a market that, say, modestly improves? Clearly, headwinds
through technology and efficiency gains, but some volume improvement. How do you measure those two against each
other?

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, you ask a good question. As we get reviews with the business, we obviously try to
understand what the peers are doing and the industry overall because until the capacity is absorbed, we're not going to
see any improvement in price, and pricing has to improve. I mean, it's a tough business right now.
But I'll tell you that everybody, our peers included, are making headway in efficiencies. And so again, it's just going to
drag out the amount of time until this 20% capacity is absorbed. And look at us as a perfect example. I mean, we're not
the only one improving the efficiency of our fleet. So I think this overhang of capacity is going to be with us for as far
as I can see into 2014, that's for sure.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. Just final, since I'm the last one, on the depreciation relative to CapEx, you're spending
15%, 16% more than depreciation. Do you see a scenario where your CapEx can kind of drop in line with depreciation
given the more capital intensive component such as Pressure Pumping is in overcapacity?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Not overall, Ole. Certainly, in Pressure Pumping, we're spending a heck of a lot less than we
used to. But we're still in a growth business. We're growing revenues quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. And we've
got to replenish our tool fleet regularly and introduce new products. And so I think unless you see a dip, heaven forbid,
a dip in the rig count, we're probably still going to be spending above depreciation for the next...
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. Above sales growth, above depreciation?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yes.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: All right. Thanks, Ole.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you. Thank you very much.
