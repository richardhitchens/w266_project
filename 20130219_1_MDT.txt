MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Brandi and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to Medtronic's Q3 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Warren
Thank you, Brandi.
Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar
Ishrak, Medtronic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Chief Financial Officer, will provide
comments on the results of our fiscal year 2013 third quarter, which ended January 25, 2013. After our prepared
remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be
considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any
forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is
contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking
statements.
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investor portion of our
website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are

And with that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today.
This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $4.027 billion, which represented growth of 4%. Q3 non-GAAP
earnings of $946 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.93, increased 7% and 11% respectively.
Despite facing many challenges, Q3 represented another step in building toward our goal of delivering consistent
growth on both revenue and earnings per share inline with our baseline expectations.
We had a number of businesses and geographies that delivered strong performances, but at the same time, we faced
some unexpected pressures in certain areas. We're still in the process of strengthening and geographically diversifying
our business, so that we can continue to deliver a balanced and consistent performance reliably.
In the quarter, we continued to see sequential stabilization in two of our key markets; U.S. ICDs and U.S. Core Spine.
While these businesses declined a combined 2% versus the prior year, average daily sales grew 4% sequentially, as we
have 5 fewer selling days in Q3.
In addition, our daily revenue share increased sequentially in both of these markets, despite facing competitive
year-ends. Gary will walk you through the details later, but the trends confirm that these markets are indeed stabilizing.
At the same time, we continue to manage challenges in other businesses. First, U.S. Pacing declined 8% versus the
prior year and daily sales declined 2% sequentially. Our procedure volumes were relatively stable through December,
but decelerated in January. However, our Q3 performance was in line with the market and we do expect further
improvement with the launch of Advisa MRI, which recently received FDA approval.
Also, our International Pacing business covered for the weakness in the U.S., growing 5% and taking over 300 basis
points of share year-over-year.
Next, our BMP business continues to face pressure and declined 21% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Diabetes,
historically a high-growth business, also faced some near-term pressure in the U.S., as we wait to receive FDA
approval for our MiniMed 530G. We expect Diabetes to quickly return to faster growth once our new products are
approved.
Our other high-growth platforms continued to perform well in Q3. In the Cardiac and Vascular Group, our AF and
Endovascular businesses delivered double-digit growth, while our transcatheter valve business had upper single-digit
growth. In the Restorative Therapies Group, our DBS Gastro/Uro, CGM, Neurosurgery and Advanced Energy
businesses all delivered double-digit growth, while ENT and Pain Stim grew in the high- and mid-single digits
respectively. Combined, this broad-base of growth platforms, including insulin pumps, represented over 35% of our
revenue and delivered 9% growth in Q3.
Recent product approvals and upcoming launches will also contribute to sustain future growth. In CVG, we recently
received CE Mark for our Evera family of ICDs and FDA approval of our Advisa MRI pacemaker. Looking ahead,
we're expecting CE Mark approval for our Engager transapical aortic valve this spring and are targeting the U.S. launch
of our Viva, CRT and Evera ICD products this summer. We're also expecting approval for our Endurant II AAA Stent
Graft in Japan this summer.
In the Restorative Therapies Group, we recently received CE Mark approval for the first spinal cord stimulation
systems that have an indication for full-body MRI scans. As I mentioned, we're waiting for approval of our MiniMed
530G, which includes our new insulin pump, CGM sensor, and threshold suspend automation algorithm.

Looking beyond FY 2014, we're executing on our U.S. trials for the CoreValve transcatheter valve and the Symplicity
renal denervation system, and are targeting FY 2015 approval from these two important growth drivers.
Turning to International, our revenue grew 7% with strong growth in Japan and emerging markets offsetting declines in
Western Europe. While we've been monitoring Western Europe closely over the past year, Q3 was the first quarter
where we experienced a meaningful slowdown, declining 1%. Western Europe sales were tracking through the first two
months of the quarter, but our daily sales slowed in January. Like we have mentioned, the softness that we've been
experiencing in prior quarters was in Southern Europe, especially in Italy.
Towards the end of Q3, we saw a more generalized softness in several markets, including Germany. We are engaged
with our Western Europe team to capitalize the markets and our growth, but we do believe it is prudent to be cautious
in our expectations as we manage these challenges going forward.
Japan had another strong quarter with growth of 18%, more than absorbing the unfavorable impact of R-Zone pricing
that went into effect last April. Several of our new innovative products are generating significant physician interest.
In CRDM, we gained over 8 points of pacemaker share sequentially on the successful launch of Advisa MRI. In
Coronary, the Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent gained 4 points of DES share sequentially. We also are seeing great
customer acceptance for our Endurant AAA Stent Graft and RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator in Japan.
In emerging markets, our Q3 growth was 21%. Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China, the Middle East and Africa,
and India all grew at or above 20%. Latin America growth was somewhat slower in Q3, as we continue to work
through product registration issues in certain businesses. Revenue growth improved in China this quarter, although it
was somewhat aided by the easier comparisons due to the timing of the Chinese New Year.
In addition to our focus in expanding our existing businesses in the Chinese multinational segment, we've made two
strategic moves this year to expand our presence in the Chinese local segment. We closed on our acquisition of China
Kanghui Holdings, our entry into the global trauma, spine and ortho value segments, and Kanghui's performance is
meeting our expectations. We also recently completed our investments in LifeTech Scientific and our teams are already
working together to enter the Structural Heart value segment.
Emerging market growth, meaningful product launches, our high-growth platforms, and market stabilization are all key
factors to building a dependable business that can deliver consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth.
To achieve this, growth from these areas have to be successfully offset – have to successfully offset different areas of
pressure, which for this quarter were Europe, BMP, insulin pumps and U.S. Pacing.
As I mentioned earlier, our goal is to strengthen our business in order to consistently deliver on our mid-single-digit
revenue growth expectations. In addition to our focus on the top line, we are also executing on both our product and
SG&A cost-reduction initiatives, which together with financial leverage from our share buybacks, will help us grow
earnings per share 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster than revenue.
We're working on reducing product costs by $1.2 billion over the next five years, which is important not only to
maintain our gross margins, but also fuels the development of tiered products, which are essential to creating new value
segment opportunities.
We're also making progress on our plans to increase our U.S. cash flow through working-capital improvements, and
have set an early goal of improving our inventory turns by 50% over the next five years. Not only does this instill a
good fiscal discipline, but it will strengthen our already-robust levels of free cash flow generation.
Over the next five years, we expect to generate $25 billion of free cash flow and remain committed to returning 50% of
this to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We believe this level of commitment is appropriate,
given our current mix of U.S. and International free cash flow. The remaining 50% gives us ample flexibility to make
investments for sustainable growth and we are and will continue to be very disciplined in how we deploy this capital,
with a particular focus on returns. We expect any M&A transaction to surpass our mid-teens risk-adjusted hurdle rate
and we do not intend to pass along EPS dilution to our shareholders.

In addition to building credibility and a track record of delivering on our baseline expectations, we're also executing on
transformational opportunities that we believe will establish durability in our long-term performance and create
potential upside for our baseline.
Our first long-term transformational opportunity is accelerating globalization. As I mentioned before, we believe there
is significant opportunity to deepen the penetration of our existing therapies in emerging markets. It is striking to
recognize that only 8% of the population in emerging markets that can benefit from and have the financial means to
afford our therapies are indeed receiving them. Increasing this penetration level to that of developed markets represents
a $5 billion annual opportunity with margins comparable to developed markets.
To realize this opportunity, we are focusing on breaking down barriers such as major deficiencies in the areas of
awareness, infrastructure and training. The Middle East is one example of an emerging market that has a strong desire
to improve its healthcare system.
I was in Dubai last month attending the largest healthcare congress in the region and came away very impressed and
encouraged by our plans to realize the potential and generate significant growth in this region over the coming years.
As we develop the premium segment in emerging markets, we're also creating the necessary infrastructure to
participate in the next wave of growth; the emerging market value segment. As I mentioned earlier, we're taking early
steps to be a global leader in this segment with our acquisition of Kanghui and partnership with LifeTech. We believe
that building a platform of multi-tiered products will allow our businesses to sustain 20% growth in emerging markets
over the long-term.
Our other transformational opportunity beyond globalization is our ability to deliver economic value to our customers,
supported by our market-leading technologies. Healthcare payment models are becoming more complex with new
pay-per-value models becoming more important.
In addition, our customers are evolving and now include hospital system, C-suite executives, payers and governments.
Within this changing environment, we are transforming our business to not only deliver clinical value, but also deliver
economic value. This transformation will include not only our existing products, but also developing and piloting new
economic value programs. We're in the early stages of this transformation, but we believe Medtronic has specific
competitive advantages to win in the new value-oriented environment.
First, our market-leading products remain a critical factor to maintaining a strong position of advocacy in the hospital.
Second, Medtronic has some of the world's leading experts in the area of healthcare economics and reimbursement,
with a core skill set in economic value. And third, Medtronic's breadth and scale gives us the presence to be a desired
partner to large players and providers. It is important to note that Medtronic is the only medical technology company
positioned with all three of these advantages in our markets, which will significantly differentiate us in the new
healthcare environment.
Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results, before we take your questions. Gary?
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar.
Third-quarter revenue of $4.027 billion increased 3% as reported and 4% on a constant currency basis, after adjusting
for a $41 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency.
Q3 revenue results by region were as follows: growth in Central and Eastern Europe was 24%; the Middle East and
Africa grew 23%; growth in Greater China was 22%; South Asia grew 20%; growth in Asia-Pacific was 15%,
including 18% growth in Japan; Latin America grew 14%; growth in the U.S. was 1%, while Western Europe and
Canada declined 1%.

The emerging markets grew a combined 21% in Q3 and represented 12% of our total sales mix. While this is an
improvement, it was aided by easier comparisons due to the timing of the Chinese New Year, which conversely will
turn into a difficult comparison in Q4. Accordingly, we would expect Q4 emerging market growth to be in the
mid-teens.
Q3 earnings and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $946 million and $0.93, an increase of 7% and
11% respectively. Q3 GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $988 million and $0.97, an increase of 6%
and 10% respectively.
Included in our Q3 GAAP earnings was a $70 million gain, primarily related to a change in fair value of our Ardian
contingent commercial milestone payments, which are based on annual revenue growth through FY 2015.
Given the current slower commercial ramp in Europe and protracted U.S. regulatory process, we now expect our
milestone payments to be reduced as some of the value of our Ardian business has now shifted beyond the final
revenue milestone date.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2.100 billion grew 5%. Results were driven by solid growth in
Coronary, Endovascular, Structural Heart and AF Solutions, partially offset by declines in ICDs.
CRDM revenue of $1.171 billion declined 1%. Worldwide ICD revenue of $654 million declined 2%, which was
slightly better than the overall market as our shock reduction and Lead Integrity Alert technologies, combined with our
proven long-term lead performance continue to receive strong market acceptance.
In the U.S., our ICD revenue was stable sequentially after adjusting for fewer selling days. Our lead-to-port ratio
remained strong and it is as highest points in several years. In addition, our ICD implant volumes grew 5%, the fourth
quarter in a row of implant growth. At the same time, our U.S. ICD pricing declined 5%, while hospitals continue to
reduce their bulk purchases on a year-over-year basis, they were sequentially stable again this quarter.
Taken together, these trends suggest that our U.S. ICD business is stabilizing. At the same time, we are monitoring the
European ICD markets very closely as it is declining mid-single-digits, driven by deteriorating pricing in some key
markets.
Despite the declines, we are gaining share and have a number of new high-power products come into market, including
the Evera ICD with increased longevity and the most advanced shock reduction technology available. The Viva CRTD
with Adaptive CRT for significantly better response rates, the Attain Performa second-generation quadripolar lead, and
our unique CardioGuide real-time navigation systems to improve CRT implant procedures.
Pacing revenue of $459 million was flat, outperforming the global market by over 200 basis points as we gained global
pacing share on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.
Our U.S. Pacing revenue declined 8% inline with the market. These declines were driven primarily by pricing, which
was down in the mid-single digits, and to a lesser extent declines in implant volumes.
In Japan, our low-power business grew over 20% as our Advisa MRI pacemaker gained 8 points of share sequentially,
including a double-digit increase in new implants.
Coronary revenue of $445 million grew 19%. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $274 million, including $97
million in the U.S. and $30 million in Japan. Resolute Integrity's deliverability, unique FDA labeling for diabetes and
long-term clinical performance is receiving strong customer acceptance globally. This is reflected in our DES share
where we gained another point of share sequentially in the U.S. and nearly 4 points of share sequentially in Japan. This
quarter's performance has now propelled us to the number one global market position in combined DES bare metal
stent share.
In renal denervation, while Q3 commercial results continued to be soft, the long-term outlook for this opportunity in
hypertension remains robust and we are investing in evidence generation and technology development to further
strengthen our leadership position.

Revenue is still lagging behind our original expectations, due primarily to the lack of broad reimbursement and limited
funding for new technology in nearly every European market. Many referring physicians and payers are waiting for
larger data sets and longer-term follow-up, including data from our HTN-3 U.S. pivotal study, which we expect to have
fully enrolled by summer.
We are still tracking for an FY 2015 U.S. approval, albeit later in the fiscal year. At the same time, we continue to
advance our leading renal denervation technology pipeline and expect to receive CE Mark for our Symplicity spiral and
multi-electrode catheter this summer. This product will take ablation times down from 16 minutes to 24 minutes today
to only 2 minutes, and all through a very small 6 French catheter. We believe our technology, strong clinical data and
significant intellectual property represents a large multi-billion dollar opportunity in renal denervation.
In Structural Heart, revenue of $272 million increased 4%, including 6% growth in transcatheter valves. We estimate
the international transcatheter valve market grew 6% to 8% in Q3. Our CoreValve device continues to have leading
share in our addressable market. With the expected CE market approval of our Engager valve this spring, we expect to
expand into the transapical segment, which represents approximately 20% of the international TAVI market. Positive
data from our Engager CE pivotal trial demonstrating high procedural success and exceptional rates of PBL at 6 months
were presented at FCS in January.
Also on the clinical front, we are actively enrolling patients in our global SURTAVI trial, which is designed to expand
the market for CoreValve into more moderate risk patients. In our CoreValve U.S. pivotal study, enrollment in our
extreme and high-risk arms is complete and we remain on track to commercialize in the U.S. in FY 2015.
In the Endovascular, revenue of $212 million grew 14% with strong balanced growth across our aortic and peripheral
businesses. In aortic, our AAA business grew in the double-digits, driven by strong growth from Endurant in Japan and
a continued acceptance of Endurant II in other global markets.
Our thoracic business grew over 25% on the strength of Valiant Captivia in the U.S. and China. In peripheral, we had
double-digit growth in our peripheral stent business. Our drug-eluting balloon business also had double-digit growth in
Q3 and we recently completed enrollment in our U.S. pivotal study trial for our impact drug-eluting balloon with an
SFA indication.
Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $1.927 billion grew 3%. Results are driven by growth in
Surgical Technologies, Neuromodulation and Diabetes, partially offset by declines in BMP and balloon kyphoplasty.
Spine revenue of $753 million declined 3% globally and 6% in the U.S., primarily driven by declines in BMP and
BKP. We completed our Kanghui acquisition in Q3 and as expected there was no overall impact to Spine's organic
growth in Q3, as we started to wind down our Weigao joint venture while only recognizing two months of Kanghui
revenue.
Core Spine revenue of $639 million was flat globally and declined 1% in the U.S. Excluding BKP, our Core Spine
business grew 2% globally and grew 1% in the U.S. which was a point higher than the U.S. market as we gained share
on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Our U.S. core business continued to stabilize as new products and
procedures are rolling out and performing well. In thoracolumbar, our Solera system is generating strong surgeon
interest.
In Cervical, we are beginning to seeing growth in U.S. disc as we ramp up surgeon training of our recently launched
BRYAN ACD. In Interbody, our new AMT portfolio and CAPSTONE CONTROL a product used in our mass mid-lift
procedure are driving growth. In other biologics, the adoption of our Grafton and MagniFuse DBMs continue to
perform well.
We are also differentiating our Spine business from the competition through enabling technologies such as O-arm
Imaging, StealthStation Navigation and POWEREASE powered surgical instruments.
Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for spine surgery, as they see clear value from better outcomes and
more efficient procedures. This is also resulting in significant pull-through for navigation in power-enabled spinal
implants.

In fact, in accounts that have our O-arm, we are seeing Core Spine revenue grow 10 points higher than non-O-arm
accounts this fiscal year. We believe, we are still only on the leading edge of this large differentiated opportunity in
Spine.
In BMP, revenue of $114 million declined 21%, as this business continues to face CE market uncertainty. The Yale
University is overseeing the finalization and publication of the findings from independent reviews of the BMP data.
They control the timing and we now understand from them that the systematic reviews are not likely to be published
until early FY 2014.
To a lesser extent, our Q3 results were also affected by our inability to fulfill hospital quarter-end sales orders due to a
supply constraint of sterile water, which is a component of an INFUSE kit. We received FDA approval for an alternate
sterile water supplier last week, which will allow us to work through our back order kits in Q4.
Surgical Technologies revenue of $350 million grew 10%, driven by double-digit growth in Neurosurgery and
Advanced Energy. Neurosurgery performance was driven by Midas Rex powered surgical equipment and core
navigation, including sales of StealthStation S7 surgical navigation systems.
In Advanced Energy, strong double-digit growth of our – both of our Aquamantys bipolar sealers, and PEAK
PlasmaBlade electrosurgical products drove results.
Turning to Neuromodulation, revenue of $447 million increased 7%, these results were driven by strong global growth
in DBS in Gastro/Uro as well as Pain Stim in the U.S.
In DBS, we had another strong quarter of double-digit growth as our referral channels development efforts are
generating new implants. Our Gastro/Uro business also grew double-digits in Q3, driven by strong adoption of our
InterStim Therapy in Western Europe and in the U.S.
In Pain Stim, we are now launching in Europe, the market's first spinal cord stimulator system that are approved for full
body MRI scans, including our RestoreSensor of SureScan MRI stimulator and Vectris SureScan MRI lead.
Diabetes revenue of $377 million grew 3%, driven by double-digit growth in CGM. In the U.S. Diabetes declined 1%
as U.S. consumers continued to wait for FDA approval of the MiniMed 530G insulin pump and Enlite sensor, which
we now hope to occur later this spring or summer.
In addition to the impact of the delay, we also deferred $9 million in revenue, as we plan to convert some of the
recently sold pumps to the new technology once it is approved. Outside the United States, our business grew 11%,
although insulin pump growth slowed somewhat in Western Europe, as we await the launch of our next-generation
insulin pump, the MiniMed 640G this summer.
Now turning to the rest of the income statement, the gross profit margin was 75.2%. Excluding the unfavorable impact
of foreign currency, our gross margin was 75.8%. Foreign currency's negative impact on our gross margin offset the
overall efficiencies in product manufacturing which are results of our ongoing $1.2 billion initiative to reduce product
cost over 5 years. In Q4, we expect gross margins to be approximately 75.5%.
Third quarter R&D spending of $376 million was 9.3% of revenue. We remain committed to investing in new
technologies to drive future growth; and for Q4, we expect R&D spending to be around 9%.
Third quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.401 billion represented 34.8% of sales. Excluding the unfavorable impact of
foreign currency, Q3 SG&A on an operational basis was 34.7%, a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter of
last year.
We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses, while at the same time investing in new product
launches and adding to our sales force in faster growing businesses and geographies. In FY 2013, we continued to
expect to drive 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement.

Amortization expense for the quarter was $88 million, an expected increase from prior quarters due to the Kanghui
acquisition. For Q4, we continue to expect amortization expense to be approximately $90 million.
Net other expense for the quarter was $17 million, which was lower than our original forecast due to less-than-planned
U.S. medical device tax, royalty expense and minority interest in elimination as we wind down our Weigao joint
venture.
Net gains from our hedging programs were $13 million during the quarter. As you know, we hedge our operating
results to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. Based on current exchange rates, we expect Q4 net
other expense to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $46 million. Excluding the $23 million non-cash charge for convertible debt
interest expense, non-GAAP net interest expense was $23 million. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $11.8
billion in cash and cash investments and $11.4 billion in debt.
In Q4, we have $2.2 billion of convertible debt that we intend to refinance as straight debt, which will result in higher
cash interest rates on this portion of our debt. As a result, based on current interest rates, we anticipate non-GAAP net
interest expense to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million in Q4, due to the debt overlap. And it's also worth
noting that we will no longer have convertible debt outstanding in FY 2014 and the non-GAAP adjustment will not be
applicable.
Based on current rates, we would expect net interest expense to be $40 million to $45 million per quarter throughout
FY 2014 a level that is more comparable to our current GAAP interest expense level.
Let's now turn to our tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 14.5%. Excluding the impact of certain
acquisition-related items and the impact of the non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense, our adjusted
non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q3 was 15.8%. Included in this rate, our tax benefits associated with the extension of
the U.S. R&D tax credit.
In addition, the finalization of certain income tax returns and audits resulted in a $0.01 benefit from our original tax
expectations. For FY 2013, we expected an adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 19.5%.
Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated approximately $3.4 billion in free cash flow. We are committed to returning
50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Fiscal year-to-date, we have paid approximately $800 million in dividends
and repurchased more than $1.2 billion of our common stock. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to
repurchase approximately 27 million shares. Third quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.021
billion shares.
Let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal year 2013 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We believe
a constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4% remains reasonable for the full fiscal year 2013.
Although, we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates
were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year that our FY 2013 revenue would be unfavorably
affected by approximately $300 million to $320 million, including an unfavorable $20 million to $40 million impact in
Q4.
With respect to earnings per share guidance, we continue to expect FY 2013 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in
the range of $3.66 to $3.70, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 6% to 7%. While we do not provide
quarterly guidance, based on our performance through three quarters, we would expect to be at the upper end of our
ranges on both revenue and earnings per share.
As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the
fiscal year, nor do they includes the impact of a non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense.
I will now turn it back over to Omar, who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar?

Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Gary.
Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me conclude by reiterating that Q3 represented another quarter in building
toward our goal of delivering consistent and dependable growth. While we continue to execute in areas we can control,
including growing our markets we're in the same time early in the process of building a business that is strong enough
to offset the variables that are beyond our control, so that we can reliably deliver on our baseline expectations which
are: consistent mid-single digit revenue growth; consistent EPS growth 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster than
revenue; and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.
At the same time, we're also playing a leading role in transforming global healthcare by implementing our long-term
strategies of economic value and globalization.
We're only at the beginning of establishing our track record, but we believe that crisp execution on both our baseline
and long-term growth strategies combined with strong and disciplined capital allocation will enable us to create
long-term dependable value in healthcare.
With that, we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President
of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; and Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group, to join us
again for the Q&A session.
We're rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so we respectfully request you limit yourself to only one question and
if necessary, one follow up so that we can get to as many people as possible. If you have any additional questions,
please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.
Operator, first question, please?

Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Morning, Mike.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Looks like January was a little bit soft. And just curious how the January performance
impacts your thinking relative to the goal of getting back to mid-single-digit revenue growth in the near term. And I
know it's premature to think about FY 2014, but if you had to think about it today, how that would influence that goal
of getting back to mid-single digits for FY 2014?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: You know, Mike, the goal is still there. Obviously, the slowdown in January especially in
Europe put some challenges in our way. But we feel that we're strengthening our business in enough ways to get there.
Like we mentioned at JPMorgan, there are basically – our roadmap included strengthening of the U.S. ICD and Spine
markets and of offsetting the year-over-year bad comparison, if you like, with Resolute Integrity. However – and on top
of that, the rest of the businesses were supposed to grow, if you recall, at about 4.5% and – or 5% and that's where we
were sort of road mapping our mid-single digits.
Now, Europe's got pressure, but at the same time, Japan has got some upside. And we're like pushing emerging markets
quite hard. And that's basically our game plan, to offset these different variables and address the challenges and then
reach our goal, which we think is still achievable.

<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, Mike, if I can just add to what Omar said. I mean, overall, we – obviously, January,
especially in Europe, was softer than we had expected. And as we indicated in our comments, that gives us a little bit of
pause.
But as Omar said, there is a lot of parts of Medtronic. And we're going to have to push harder in some other areas. And
we don't know what the impact of Europe is going to be long-term either. We have to make sure how – we'll see how
that plays out.
But as Omar said, Japan continues to be very, very strong. The U.S., we're starting to see some growth back in some of
our core businesses on Spine and CRDM. So net-net, we're still – our goal is to put together plans that can deliver on
that mid-single digit growth.
Now we – as you indicated, we're not giving FY 2014 guidance yet, but that is still our plan to deliver on the mid-single
digit revenue growth.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up. On the Diabetes business, it sounded like
you got a round of questions on the 530G approval. Any sense of the likelihood that pushes out beyond just a 3-month
turnaround?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, I can't really say. I mean, we're working with the FDA closely and we're pretty
optimistic that we will get it in the next few months, but a regulatory process has unknowns, which we cannot control.
But at this stage, we're working closely with them and achieve – and expect to achieve a positive outcome.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thank you, Omar.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Thanks, Mike.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Hey, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on Mike's question on Diabetes. The U.S. it was
down 1%; I know the pump business, you're being held up by the new approval, but how is the disposable business
tracking? And is the diabetes market, in your view, for pump slowing overall?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: We're such a big piece of the market, I think, we obviously have an impact on that. There are
some pressures that the other competitors have also faced, but I think the new pump is a strong enough catalyst that it
will further growth of the market. And we're a big enough player in that space.
And as far as the disposable market is concerned, I think that's fine.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, Matt the disposables overall are growing fine. We're not seeing any – on the CGM or
disposables, we're not seeing any real slowdown there. It's primarily on the pump side of the equation and we do
believe it is related to the fact that people are waiting for the new pump for its approval and so that's clearly had an
impact.
I mean, I think, the overall pump market in the U.S. had been somewhat slower. Even if you went back over the last
year, it had been somewhat slower.
But what we've seen outside the United States when you get this new pump approved, the 530G, with its Low Glucose
Suspend feature we've seen that we actually reaccelerated the markets and we saw that outside the United States and in
Europe where we saw double-digit growth for really two years since the pump was – has been launched.
And so we are expecting that will accelerate pump growth in the U.S. And, as Omar said, we're such a large part of the
market that clearly will drive market growth.

<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Okay. And a quick one for Mike Coyle. With the Advisa now out, can you compare and
contrast how much more of the market or what the potential share benefit is of Advisa versus Revo?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So obviously, you've seen Advisa has had a real impact on our growth in Japan, but it was
also the first MRI product to be approved in Japan.
Since Revo has been in the marketplace here for a year in the U.S. we don't expect quite as much benefit as we are
seeing in Japan. But on the other hand, adding all of the top-end feature sets of the – of our Advisa pacemaker to now
an MRI-capable product, gives us an opportunity we think both on price as well as on market share.
And importantly, it also gives us now, Revo has a product tier to deal with some of the pricing pressures we've seen at
the mid-tier. So we think it's going to be an important addition to our product line, and we think it'll continue the
momentum that we're seeing in Pacing.
We're up, as we pointed out, on a global basis, two market share points year-over-year. And obviously having this to
reload our U.S. offering is very encouraging.

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Good morning. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, we can, Bob.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Great. Good morning. So I was just wondering, if you could provide some more details on
two things that you mentioned on the call. First, you talked about selling day comparisons, and I was wondering if you
could just be more specific about exactly where the mismatches were this particular quarter?
And then, secondly, on Western Europe, I was wondering, if you could just talk a little bit more detail about
specifically, which areas of the business are seeing the greatest weakness? Is it Cardiovascular? Is it Spine? Is it
pricing? Is it units? Just a little more detail on Western Europe and on the selling day mismatches that you mentioned?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. Let me cover Western Europe and I'll let Gary cover the selling day thing, and Gary can
add to the Western Europe.
Western Europe, I would answer by saying, all of the above, because, in general, we've had general softness like
everywhere. It's – I think more in the Cardiovascular area, because the products – there's more competition, and they're
more in the radar screen, if you like, of the policymakers. But every business faces a certain degree of pressure.
And it's both pricing and volume. And it varies by country. In Italy, for example, it clearly is both of them. In Germany,
it was more pricing. So, it varied according to the different countries.
What we saw this quarter which was different from previous quarters was that in previous quarters the softness, if you
like, was limited to Southern Europe. This quarter, we saw more generalized softening. And to some degree, the
general economic news we hear is kind of consistent with that.
But again, we don't know all the answers yet. We're watching this thing very carefully. Obviously, we're doing
everything we can through our specialists to make it clear to the market the value that our products bring and the value

to the healthcare system, both in terms of cost and clinical efficacy that our products bring. And through that approach,
we hope to at least stabilize the markets.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, just quickly on the selling days. Bob, what we were trying to highlight is really not a
significant difference in selling days this year versus last year.
There is a difference versus our Q3 versus Q2, which you always have. Q3 is the lowest selling days for us of any of
the quarters, just from a standpoint of obviously the holiday seasons that are in there. And so, as a result of that, Q4
versus Q3, there is 5, 6 extra selling days in our Q4 and the same thing versus Q2.
So that's all we were trying to highlight in the comments when we were comparing against that sequential – our Q2
results – that there was fewer selling days this quarter versus the prior quarter. Versus the prior year it's basically
comparable.
It does have some impact. We probably saw a little bit more impact we believe this year than last. Depending obviously
where the holidays fall in the week and what that kind of an impact is, so there was some of that softness.
In fact, that was in some ways what we thought might have been some of the issue, even in Europe. The first two weeks
of January clearly were much, much softer than we've ever historically seen, and so we couldn't tell whether that was
really a holiday effect or not. So we're watching it closely.
But clearly that's what we were trying to get at in the selling-days comment. There is no difference really on –
year-on-year.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Thanks. And then just as one quick follow-up on the BMP supply constraint. How much
did that impact the revenues in the quarter? And when do you expect that to be resolved?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, right now, it is resolved. So we are shipping with the – where the – the supply constraint
is done. We've got approval on the sterile water supply, right, from the FDA. So that piece is resolved.
How much of an impact there it had? It had some impact. I mean, Chris, do you want to make a comment on that, if
you want?
<A - Christopher J. O'Connell>: Sure. Bob, it wasn't a major impact. We were on allocation on certain kit sizes
because of the sterile water supply issue, and we didn't take typical end-of-the-quarter orders.
And so now that we have FDA approval on a new supplier for sterile water, we're in the process of releasing inventory
and getting back into – and getting off an allocation basis on that product. And so I would characterize it as minor.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Hello, good morning.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Hi, David.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Hi, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Omar, you gave us more detail on the acquisition strategy than we've had in prior quarters, so I
wanted to start there. And maybe one follow-up.
I guess if you can give us some more color in terms of how you're thinking about the size of transaction. We've sort of
become comfortable with Medtronic the last several years doing deals that were less than $1 billion. Maybe if you
could talk just about the size of transaction. Maybe the stage of development.

It sounds like your preference is still emerging markets over developed markets, but within emerging markets, you did
talk about some nice return goals. Help us understand sort of how you think about those return goals as it relates to
transactions like Kanghui, which are very much infrastructure-type of deals. But any additional color you could give us
on some of those components would be very helpful?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think, David, the goals and the hurdles don't change based on whether it's a geographic
broadening acquisition or a new technology acquisition. I mean, those goals don't change.
We really look at two things, or three things, if you like. We look for a strategic fit. A strategic fit – we've already
described our businesses in three groups: the Cardiovascular Group, the Restorative Therapy Group, which essentially
includes Ortho and Spine in a broad sense – and Neuro for that matter – Ortho, Spine and Neuro – and Diabetes. And
we are aiming to fill gaps within these groups. That's one area of strategic focus.
And the other is, as we fill those gaps, we're also looking at acquisitions that can help us deliver economic value, and
that could mean broadening our focus in the continuum of care, but always related to our therapies. And by that I mean,
looking at businesses which help us identify patients better or more efficiently, as well as patient-management
offerings.
And the other area is globalization. And in globalization, it's primarily – at this stage, anyway, is approaching the value
segment. Although we're quite interested in sort of market growth as well, if we see fit. Distribution companies who are
– who've got high share and have got credibility in certain marketplaces are also areas that we look at. So those are the
areas that we look at. That's the first thing, the strategic focus.
The second is, it's got to have certain hurdle rates in the mid-teens, and that applies to everyone, no matter who we buy.
And the third is that we've got to cover dilution within the company. And by covering dilution, what I mean is that our
goal of delivering this mid-single digit growth with 200 basis points to 400 basis points of leverage and EPS is
something we want to protect, despite an acquisition. The acquisition should help us get there rather than get in the way
of achieving that.
So these are the things that we try to look at for the acquisition. The size, if it meets all these criteria, is a secondary
factor.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay, very helpful. And then, Gary, just a quick follow-up here. If we think about margins and
progression throughout the year, specifically gross margins, they have come down maybe 50 basis points, 60 basis
points across the quarters.
If you just sort of – if we get to the fourth-quarter number that you provided – is obviously where it comes in at – can
you just give us a sense of the factors across the quarters, whether it's FX, some of the pricing pressure you talked
about, or geographic mix? So, what's been sort of the incremental downward pressure on GMs across the quarters?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, well, as we indicated, obviously FX was a big impact, especially over the last couple of
quarters. And the good news is as we go into the fourth quarter here, we're starting to anniversary, especially versus the
euro, some significant changes on the FX. And so the FX impact certainly in Q4 is less on the gross margin line and so
we do expect that we're not going to quite have quite the negative impact that we've had in the last two or three quarters
from that factor.
As you indicated, I mean, obviously, we continue to see pricing pressures across the organization. We've talked about
that. The revenue mix, you've got positives and negatives. Japan obviously being a big growth engine right now has
higher margins, and that's a positive. Having the U.S. actually coming back and seeing the CRDM business and even
Spine in the U.S., which are higher-margin businesses improving, is good. But we still have pricing pressure that we're
offsetting, and then we're having product-cost reductions, obviously, as we continue to take the $1.2 billion of product
cost out. So we're seeing a benefit on that side of the equation.
So there's a lot of factors that are driving it. Overall, we feel still very confident that we're kind of in – we've been able
to maintain that 75% to 76% range. It's going to vary by 30 basis points, 40 basis points in kind of given quarters. But
in general, as we indicated for the fourth quarter, 75.5% is what we're looking at, and that's assuming that the FX

Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Omar and then a follow-up for
Mike.
Omar, at JPM, you were sounding reasonably optimistic that mid-single digits was feasible with kind of reasonable
assumptions. Clearly, January in Europe seemed to be a surprise to the company. Now the question is do you guys have
intelligence as to whether or not January was just a bad month? Or there were specific, identifiable policy changes that
really impacted the quarter?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I don't think we have really hard evidence, but our – obviously, we've looked into this very
closely and are watching the trends very carefully as well.
The policy changes, there aren't any dramatics – across-the-board policy changes in Europe that we can point to.
However, in Italy, for example, some of the policy changes are – people are driving more strongly, and it's having an
impact.
I think there is a general concern – and it's a little qualitative, but there's a general concern over the overall economy in
Europe. Like you've heard recently in the press, there's even a concern about growth in Germany. And I think that to
some degree is probably driving some of this caution in the marketplace, both from policymakers as well as patients
themselves, to the degree that they participate in paying for their own healthcare.
So that's the best that I can do with that. And I'd be welcome to -
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: No, I mean I – Bruce, this is Gary. I don't know if I can add much more to what Omar said.
Obviously, as you indicated, we were surprised by January. We had seen – through December, we were feeling pretty
good and then January clearly was softer.
As we indicated, clearly the first couple weeks, we could maybe point to the holidays and say that, that was maybe just
an unusual impact and that was both how we were explaining it. And we saw – we did see a recovery a little bit in the
back half of January, but we're still cautious because it's not like it has bounced back to where we were previously at, as
far as growth rates.
And so, we're watching it carefully, but we don't have any – as Omar said, there's nothing from a policy or – direction
that changed in January. There wasn't anything that came out from the governments or anything else that would have
changed how – why January ended up being the way it was. And it just seems as the overall, as Omar said, the overall
economy and concern and focus on healthcare is what's kind of focused on this and will have to wait and see how –
how this plays out.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Okay. And then on for – on TAVI, Western Europe is haves and have-nots, and I was
wondering if you guys could comment on just general trajectory of volume and price. And what's it going to take to get
the rest of Western Europe to look more like Germany where they're moving past partner one into partner two type
patients? And then, finally, when is the extreme risk data from your trial in the U.S. likely to be made available?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Well, on the question of Europe in general, we believe the availability of data into the more
moderate risk patient populations is going to be the key item to expanding the usage of the technology more broadly

outside of Germany and obviously we're very aggressively pursuing enrollment in our SURTAVI program to provide
those data.
In addition, for us, obviously the ability for us to penetrate the transapical segment is going to be important and then we
expect Engager CE Mark here in the spring and going forward that gives us an opportunity to penetrate what's roughly
20% of the overall market. So, those would be the primary drivers, I would point to, for what will keep the growth
going in the upper single-digit kind of range for Europe.
In terms of availability for our data, we are in the – on the U.S. trial, we would expect that to become available in the
fall timeframe for sharing more generally and that's what I would set as an expectation.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: I guess just to follow up on, like you look at the UK and Belgium, I mean, they are not even
into – through partner one yet. I mean, so what's it going to take to open up markets like that?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: I mean, again, I think there has to be compelling data to show the use of this technology in
lower risk patients to really get at the larger patient population and I think that we are very aggressively pursuing the
generation of those data.

<Q - Raj S. Denhoy>: Hi. Good morning.

<Q - Raj S. Denhoy>: Wonder if I could ask a bit about the U.S. ICD market. I think for a couple of quarters now
you've commented about the lead-to-port ratio continuing to increase for you, but you haven't yet seen any pull-through
on the can side. And I'm curious whether you expect to do that or really what's behind that sort of lack of pull-through.

port ratios and that is very encouraging for us. I think the opportunity that we see going forward is to use some of the
unique technologies that we have within our cans to differentiate our product line. And for example, we have submitted
data for the use of our lead Integrity alert with competitive leads, which we believe would be an important catalyst for
us to be able to convert replacement shares on competitive lead products. So, that's an example of where I think we
have some opportunity to expand can penetration.
But the other piece is we just have these very robust pipeline going forward. I mean as you look at the – not only the
revised MRI program on the Pacing side, but also the Evera product line is going to be coming into the U.S. in the first
quarter of next year, which offers a significant size, shape reductions and longevity enhancements to the overall
product line, which we think will help us with the can penetration. And then the availability of the Viva/Brava product,
which offers some unique algorithms for enhancing CRT effectiveness in that segment of the population; that too will
be coming to the U.S. in the first quarter. And obviously those products, Evera and Viva/Brava, are also going to help
us in Europe where we now have the Viva/Brava approved and are getting very nice uptake on its technology – on that
technology in Europe and we'll have Evera here in the fourth quarter.
So, we think these are going to give us good opportunities to continue to share capture momentum. And what's
encouraging to us is that we're up almost a point of share year-over-year on the ICD side even though our competitors
have been in new product introduction modes and we are just entering ours. So, we think the share momentum will
continue in these segments.

<Q - Raj S. Denhoy>: Okay. Just two quick follow-ups, so in times past you've also talked about the replacement
market improving for you. How much of that share increase you're seeing is on the replacement side? And are you
actually starting to see now acceleration in that side of your business?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Most of the share capture has been on the replacement side, but we expect that to now shift to
the initial implant side as we bring in our new products.
<Q - Raj S. Denhoy>: Okay. And then just lastly into the pricing. Again, U.S. ICDs I think you noted was down 5% in
the U.S. How has that been changing? Have you seen that stabilize? Is pricing getting worse? And also, in the context
of not bulking to see negative 5% is kind of a big number.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Well, the negative 5% is slightly worse than what we had been seeing. Typically, we had been
seeing around 3% declines in the prior quarters. But obviously, we think the new products are going to give us an
opportunity to play in multiple tiers with better pricing, which is going to be helpful to us. But frankly, we've also seen
that more competitive pressure on pricing. And so we are going to continue to shift our discussions with customers to
the breadth of our CVG product offering from the standpoint that we have multiple programs for economic value
creation in leaning out their pacer clinics, leaning out patient flow through their cath labs, their blood conservation
programs, the use of the connectivity technologies that we have, like CareLink Express, for being able to do more
efficient device checks in emergency rooms.
These are all programs that we are working with accounts on in multi-product line offerings to basically address their
core economic needs beyond simply the price reductions that we're seeing. And that's something that's getting a lot
more traction and we think will help us with mitigating some of these pricing issues going forward.
<Q - Raj S. Denhoy>: That's helpful. Thank you.

Your next -
<A - Jeff Warren>: Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Dave Roman with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the question. I was hoping – I know
there's been a lot of focus on this call on trends in January in Europe, but if I look across your U.S. businesses, those
actually seem to be pretty healthy. Can you maybe just talk about the trajectory in some of the core U.S. markets? And
maybe you could help us frame it into two categories. One would be sort of looking at those businesses that have faced
a sort of reassessment of prescribing patterns, whether that's Spine or ICDs, whether we are in fact, you think, reaching
a bottom there and poised for re-acceleration? And then maybe some of the categories that are more elective in nature
where you might have seen some seasonal impact in the fourth calendar quarter and how those have trended?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: No, I think – I think you're right. I think there is room to reason for some level of optimism
regarding the U.S. market, because in general, that has at least been stable over the past few quarters. I think a number
of things. First of all, I do think in January in the early part of the year, in the U.S., there is some pressure in the market
based on people's insurance plans, deductibles start coming up early in the year, so any out-of-pocket expense people
are more careful with and that has a tendency to shift procedures to the back half of the year when they want to use up
whatever health benefits they have. So, there is that kind of pattern in the U.S. market, which we think we do see in the
early part of the year as insurance schemes become more and more patient care pay dependent. That's one factor.

But on the other hand, we do think that both in Spine and in ICDs, there is a general stabilization of volume and
implants. And Spine for example, has reached a level of stability that we haven't seen for years, I think, with the
practitioners getting comfortable with the policies in place. Now we expect to continue to work with them to drive
further growth in that market, but there does seem to be some level of stabilization. I think there is going to be issues
with pricing. I think there is going to be issues in the U.S. with healthcare reform; the Affordable Care Act gets in play
and there is a certain level of uncertainty there.
I think there is factors around, affordable care – the accountable care organizations that we have to watch. But in all of
these areas, we think that if we can demonstrate value, financially, of the products that we have, that is essential to our
success and the success of the overall healthcare system. So, we do think that the U.S. in some ways will be a little
more stable than Europe for example; but again, I mean there's uncertainty here as well.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, just to add to his – Omar's comment, David, is – what I would also say is, I think you're
right. I think the U.S. is looking better because of the stabilization in ICDs and Spine, as Omar said. I think the other
thing that people need to focus on is, as you heard from Mike and even as we move through our discussion, we have a
lot of new products that are just hitting the U.S. market at this point in time. I mean Spine has seen some uplift because
they had some new products here recently that are starting to impact and CRDM is getting ready to launch several new
products in the U.S. market. Diabetes, as we've talked about, is clearly getting ready to launch some things in the U.S.
market and the fact is some of the things that have been driving some of the emerging and international markets, some
of those products are finally just hitting the U.S. market and I think that will even have – well especially on top of the
fact that we've stabilized the ICD and Spine business, will help to start accelerating some of the growth in the U.S.
<Q - David H. Roman>: That's helpful. Maybe my follow-up could just be on that last point, Gary, where you talk
about new product launches. If we look at Ardian outside the United States, I think in your comments that has gone a
little bit more slowly than you had expected. Maybe you could provide a little bit more detail there. But maybe more
broadly speaking, as new products get phased in and launched, how should we be thinking about ramp curves and
timing of adoption? I mean, if we look across the entire sector, it seems as though, we're all used to you launch a new
product it automatically gets adopted. Those ramp curves are all looking more slowly than they used to. So, maybe just
sort of – how should we think about your new product flow and then the corresponding impact on revenue and then
earnings?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah, maybe I'll just add a few comments on that one. First of all, the ramp, increasingly
people will demand economic data because every government everywhere in the world is concerned about healthcare
costs. Even when their spending, as a percent of GDP is low, they all watch what's going on around the world and are
very careful with escalating healthcare costs. So that the need for economic value of these therapies is going to be and
is becoming as important as clinical value so that's an essential ingredient to accelerating the commercial adoption of
some of these products.
The other factor, which you have to be careful with, is that these products are different. I mean Ardian, for example,
has a referral chain. That has to be educated, which is not the same as some of the other products that we might launch.
And so, depending on the details of – and the nature of the technology and who is adopting it, what are the barriers in
changing the physician or the hospital or healthcare system workflow that's needed here, that also will affect the speed
of ramp. So, those are two things that I would look at, as we look to new products.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Okay. We've gone by the past the top of the hour, so we have time for one last question.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Just wanted to go back over – Gary, I know you mentioned other expense came in a little
bit lower. I think you cited the device tax and then also I think a gain on the sale of investment. Can you maybe just

talk about the drivers between where it came in at $17 million relative to your expectations again and whether the
device tax is something that we should expect should remain lower, whether it was just a timing issue?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, there were a few items that affected the other income and expense line item. It's a little bit
more favorable than we had expected. One is, something we should have, but we didn't note the timing on it.
With the dissolution of the Weigao joint venture – one of the things obviously as a joint venture. We consolidated the
entire sales and expense is really the joint venture, but the profits related that basically Weigao took the offsetting
profits, half the profits in effect were down as an expense and other income and expense line item. Resolving the joint
venture, that went away so that expense that we've had done in that other income expense was eliminated because of
the accounting on how we handle Weigao now joint venture. So, that was a benefit that we didn't anticipate at the
beginning of the quarter. It obviously is offset by the fact that you don't have the revenues and everything else that we
would've – we also lost from the resolution of the joint venture. And Kanghui, obviously, then the revenues and
expenses are up all above the line, not in the other income and expense line and even though those two basically offset.
So that was one item.
The medical device tax was also a little lower than we expected. Now we only have one month of the device tax, but as
the final rules and regulations came out, basically what we saw is on something. Basically the existing inventory that's
in the field already, you don't pay the device tax on that piece of it. And so as a result of it, the only thing you pay is
what's coming to the manufacturers that actually go through to the final sale.
So, there's going to be a little bit of a slower ramp up on the device tax itself just based on what the existing inventory
levels that are out there for the various businesses. And so, it is relatively small. Our previous estimate I think even for
the fiscal year we said to be up to $50 million kind of on a pre-tax basis. Now our current estimate, based on the new
regulations would say that probably for the fiscal year, it's maybe up to $25 million – $20 million, $25 million, so it's
about half of what we expected, say, prior to the final regulations and so that was a slight benefit also.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Did you have any gains on the sale of any investments? I know that you guys were
selling Weigao.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: No, I mean nothing that's unusual. I mean, we have some periodically, where we do some, I
mean, we – but we also had some impairments on some investments also. So net-net there was no real change.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then can you provide any more color just around the – it sounded like it was a
gain related to Ardian and the contingent or future milestones. Just what the expectation was?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah. Right. What we did on the non-GAAP – excuse me, on the GAAP financials reflects the
$70 million gain which is a reduction in the contingent consideration so this is – as we made the acquisition of Ardian
we had to record, the accounting rules require you to record what you think your milestone payments are going to be
and you have to book that as a contingent consideration of liability as you go forward. Because of the – obviously the
regulatory process in the U.S. here and the enrollment, I should say, the enrollment process has been longer than we
expected and because of the slower commercialization in Western Europe because of some of the getting
reimbursement and some of these things, the whole things we've been talking about that Ardian – we're still excited
about the opportunity, but the reality is it's coming a little slower than we expected.
That means that the milestone payments that we would have to pay out based on our current estimates and forecast of
how this will ramp up, is less because we're shifting things out a little bit and we're shifting things out past – some of it
out past obviously the final milestone payment which is an FY 2015. And that gain, because the liability has now been
reduced, that liability being reduced, it goes – flows through the P&L as a gain. We recorded this obviously in the
GAAP financials, but we did not reflect it in our non-GAAP numbers, but it is a gain that the company recognizes by
reducing that liability.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Will that also have any implications on the amortization that ultimately flows through once
you get U.S. commercialization?

<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: No, because again the intangible assets and all the assets related, as the value of the Ardian
itself we still feel very, very strongly about; in fact, if anything probably feel that there's more value there long-term.
It's just that if you think about it, the value has shifted out past the milestone payment.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
