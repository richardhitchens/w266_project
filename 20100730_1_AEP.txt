Thanks Chuck and good morning everyone. Thank you much for joining us for our second quarter update. We had a
$0.74 per share quarter on ongoing earnings, something that we're very pleased with; clearly above what appeared to be
the consensus forecast of how we would do. Really some very interesting load issues that were contributors to that, and
Brian will give you some granularity about that as we go forward.
And like most of the other reporting utilities for the quarter, our best friend has been the weather, and that has been
good to us as well. We've talked at length about how we would manage operating and maintenance expenses at
American Electric Power over the last handful of years, and as we looked at the results of the first quarter and early into
the second quarter, as you know, we decided to take relatively dramatic actions on that front, which will help us not
only in 2010 to achieve our earnings range targets, but should help us going forward for the next two or four-year
cycle, and we feel that our team is prepared to continue to demonstrate the discipline that will get us there.
When we look very closely at 2010, we're confident with our earnings guidance range of 2.80 to 3.20, I'm sure that
many of you might like to tip up on that sub-tail. We don't feel that now is the time to do that. If we decide to make an
adjustment in that guidance range, it would be after we see the third quarter, because again, as Brian will share with
you, there have been some ups, there have been some downs, and there have been some flatness in the demand as we
look at energy consumption throughout the United States, the macro economic issues that you hear about and we hear
about.
Some say no chance for a second dip; some say for sure. Consumer confidence is low. Retail spending is low and many
of the things that we look at and control, those decisions are telling us let's be Midwest conservative, and that's exactly
what we intend to do.
On the regulatory front, we have 300 million rate adjustments in hand to-date, of the 320 million target number that we
began the year with. We feel very, very comfortable with the number of pending issues still being reviewed that will
meet or exceed that $320 million target that we began 2010 with. That really tells you a great deal about the value of
regulatory diversity. We've had some jurisdictions where things have gone surprisingly well, and others where they
haven't gone as well; in fact, have been somewhat disappointing. But the diversity surely has proven to be a benefit as I
know that many of you realize.
In fact, over the last six years, we've either met or exceeded our target because of that regulatory diversity. And I would
argue that that shows some of the logic of the scale and size of the footprint that American Electric Power has.
A couple of specific issues on the regulatory update: The Ohio SEET activity continues apace. As you know, Duke
Energy had sought rehearing on the original order of the SEET structure, and the PUCO decided that it would make no
sense to begin hearings on something that was already up for rehearing, so they intend to settle the rehearing issue first
and then go ahead and process the SEET cases as they suggested. They've moved the filing date to September 1. We're
prepared to file at that time. I continue to believe that no matter what the outcome is, it will be extremely digestible for
us. It will keep us within that 2.80 to 3.20 range, and it will give us a good path forward so that we can stay within the 2
to 4% growth targets that we've spoken to you about as we look at 2011, 2012 and the years beyond.
When it comes to the Turk update, we continue to build on time, under budget, and with as much safety focus as I
would hope you would expect that we would have. And we continue to defend in every court, in every jurisdiction,
wherever those who would not like to see this coal plant built, go forward. I know that you all know that we have
chosen the merchant approach or the non-rate treatment approach with the 88-megawatts that are focused for our
customers in Arkansas and so be it.
We feel that's a very supportable and, in fact, appropriate way to go. We are still going to take the output of the Turk
station to our Louisiana customers and Texas customers, through the certificates that were issued in those states. As I
mentioned, we will continue to defend and continue to build and we know that an ultra super critical plant is necessary
for this country, necessary for our customers, necessary for our company and we will continue to pursue that with all
vigor.
The transmission update is actually beginning to show some signs of encouragement. It's clear to us that the FERC
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is nothing but good news. They will attend to the issue of cost allocation and

ultimately get to the interstate process of saying that facilities that serve the many should be paid for by the many, and
in fact we're comfortable that that's the way that they will go. Their support of the SPP cost allocation method,
something that has been dubbed highway byway, is something that we believe in very strongly, and we think that and
hope that the FERC NOPR will lead us to that point on cost allocations.
There are many in the utility space who would like to argue that that shouldn't be the way. The driver for them is
raising the cost of electricity. The driver for us is lowering the cost of electricity throughout the country, and we think
we will win that event as we go forward.
As to the ability to plan for and get authority to build facilities, we think the FERC NOPR will also address that in a
very strong way. Congress continually suggests to the Chair and others of the FERC commissioners that they have the
authority to do these issues. The NOPR should put more strength behind that authority, and, if need be, ultimately
legislation will support that as well. The rationalization of the power generation fleet in the United States, the
continuing increase with renewable energy will all be served by a more robust transmission grid, something that
American Electric Power has been the champion of for decades, and clearly with the focus in the last handful of years
more comfortable that that's all moving in the right direction.
The PJM decision to one more time ratify that PATH is the best electrical plan as well as economic plan to decongest
much of the PJM, where power prices are substantially different in the Western front versus the Eastern front, was a
good decision. The timeline has been moved up and we're moving apace there as well. There are others who are
making late-in-the-game filings. Those will all go through the PJM process, and that will get sorted out as one would
expect that it should. So when we look at mid-term and long-term plans for our transmission proposals that we've been
active for a number of years, we see it as nothing but good news.
The Federal legislative update is something that I probably could take the rest of the call over. I think it's interesting to
see how this unfolds. We were, along with carbon colleagues, in a number of meetings with members of the United
States Senate on both sides of the aisle, a week ago Tuesday, and there was no consensus among two Democrats, let
alone 60. There was no consensus among two Republicans, let alone 60.
I don't see a horizon where 60 votes come in in favor of a carbon proposal in 2010. The White House has suggested
through the Czar of Energy that if we don't do it in 2010, we probably won't do it until 2013. And I'll let that statement
stand for itself.
It's interesting, as I look back at this industry, I've been at it a long while as I know many of you know. In the 1990s
when I was in New England, it was an assured American gospel that the nuclear fleet would no longer exist by the
early 2000s. All were forecasting the demise of the nuclear fleet, and I'll be darned, that didn't happen.
So here we are in 2010, and everyone is forecasting the demise of the coal fleet, and I would argue as we get to 2015
and 2020 and beyond, the coal fleet too will survive just like the nuclear fleet did, clearly different, clearly cleaner, a bit
more expensive, but nonetheless coal will continue to be a major player in the baseload generation of this country, and
American Electric Power's fleet will be doing just that.
So, when we look at these events, we aren't troubled by them. We will react to them. The EPA is moving forward with
rules and regulations that they feel are verifiable. All of them are under challenge. All of them will remain under
challenge, and eventually Congress will speak to the issue. We are strong supporters of the Rockefeller approach to say
to the EPA: let the legislators, just as the White House has suggested, address all of these issues rather than going
forward in a non-voted-for regulatory scheme that is driven toward the notion of putting this country in a very difficult
baseload power situation. And I expect all of that will move forward in the next few months and the next few years.
Let me dovetail into something that is important for us, and that's the new operating company model. One of the things
that I think our regulatory success has shown over the years is that the focus of attention on the regulator and the
customers in the states that we do business has served us well. As what we intend to do with the reorganization
structure and the cost controls that came from that activity is to put more power in the hands of the in-state operating
company presidents and give them greater line of sight over the capital expenditures.

I know that Brian has talked to many of you at length about that, and it's a project and an undertaking that we feel
strongly about. We think that it will continue to allow for a much clearer line of sight for states as they look at the
environmental challenges going forward and the decisions that need to be made as to whether one would retrofit a plant
or replace that plant with a combined cycle natural gas facility. So we feel very comfortable about the plans that we are
pursuing. We feel comfortable about 2010 guidance. We feel comfortable about our 2 to 4% earnings growth strength
at American Electric Power as we look at the next few handful of years, and we feel comfortable that the U.S Congress
will not allow the lights to go out in this great country.
With that I'll get off my soap box and turn it over to Brian. Brian.
Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Mike. If we can turn to slide four, we'll take a look at the quarter-on-quarter comparisons. AEP's ongoing
earnings for the second quarter of this year were $355 million an increase of $34 million over the last year's result of
$321 million, which was $0.68 per share. This year we are reporting $0.74 per share for the second quarter. Let me take
you through the factors that account for the changes.
The share count increase accounted for a negative penny for the quarterly comparison, reflecting 479 million average
shares outstanding this year versus 472 million in 2009. Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.03 per share or 22
million. These rate changes came from multiple of our jurisdictions reflecting the jurisdictional diversity that Mike
referenced.
Retail margin, which reflects retail sales at our utilities, net of rate, weather and firm wholesale load effects, accounted
for positive $0.05 per share or $33 million. Firm wholesale load, which reflects long term sales to utility and municipal
systems, accounted for a negative $0.03 per share or 22 million and reflects the loss of two wholesale customers. Since
the economy is not recovering as fast as we would like, weather has been our friend this year accounting for a positive
$0.05 per share or $34 million versus last year.
Off system sales net of sharing accounted for negative $0.02 per share or 12 million compared to the second quarter of
last year. We'll discuss these results further on slide eight.
O&M expenses net of revenue offsets accounted for a positive comparison to last year of $0.07 per share or $51
million. 33 million was associated with under-spend at our distribution operations and 25 million of that was associated
with the recent storm cost deferral order. The remaining dollars were associated with lowered expenses in plant
maintenance and lower expenses associated with the head count reduction across all of our companies.
Other utility operations net reflects negative $0.10 per share or 75 million and primarily reflects the absence of Cook
accidental outage insurance for 46 million, higher interest expense of 10 million, higher depreciation and amortization
expenses of 6 million and a higher effective tax and other taxes of 13 million.
Finally, non-utility operations/parent accounted for positive $0.02 per share or 12 million and primarily reflects the
gain on our remaining investment in the Intercontinental exchange.
Turning to slide five, you'll see that for the year-to-date, AEP is reporting ongoing earnings of $720 million, an
increase of $39 million over last year's result of 681 million, which was $1.55 per share. This year we are reporting
$1.50 year-to-date, and I'll take you through the factors that account for that change. We've had an increase in shares
outstanding which accounted for negative $0.14 per share. This reflects average shares outstanding of 479 million this
year versus 440 million last year.
Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.17 per share or 112 million and also came from the multiple jurisdictions as
was the case in the quarterly comparison. Retail margins were up 21 million or $0.03 per share due to recovery across
all customer classes, and I'll talk more about load on the next two slides.
Firm wholesale margin accounted for negative $0.07 per share, or $46 million in the year-to-date period. As was the
case in the quarterly period, weather was a positive contributor versus last year's results accounting for $0.11 per share

or $71 million.
Off system sales net of sharing was flat, and we usually don't have flat comparisons in these waterfall type discussions,
but we are going to have some more discussions about that on a later slide. O&M expenses net of revenue offset
accounted for a positive $0.10 per share or $66 million and is driven primarily by the same factors that I reported in the
second quarter reconciliation.
Other utility operations net accounted for a negative $0.24 or $185 million and is comprised of the following
contributors. Cook accidental outage insurance of 99 million, higher depreciation and amortization expenses of 31
million, higher interest expenses of 25 million, a higher effective tax rate of 14 million and higher other taxes of $11
million.
Let's turn to slide 6 and take a look at the normalized load trends. The top left hand side of the slide you will see that
residential sales on a normalized basis were up three-tenths of a percent for the quarter and up 1.1% for the year-to-date
period. Residential customer accounts are improving modestly and housing starts were actually up 20% versus the
second quarter of 2009.
AEP Commercial normalized -- commercial normalized sales, the top right hand side of the slide, were up 2% for the
quarter and are now up three-tenths of a percent for the year-to-date period. They tell us that commercial sales lag
going into and coming out of a recession and we're encouraged by what we see in the commercial sales category.
In the bottom left hand side of the slide, you'll see that industrial normalized sales were up 9.4% for the quarter and
they're now up 4.2% for the year-to-date period. Excluding a large -- two large aluminum customers in the East, the
quarterly number would have been up 12% and the year-to-date number would have been up 8%. We'll discuss
industrial sales more on the next slide.
Finally, on the bottom right hand side, you'll see total normalized sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and up four-tenths
of a percent for the year-to-date period. This includes the firm wholesale loads that we discussed earlier in the call.
Finally, unemployment in our service territories continues to struggle. In our East service territories, unemployment
stands at 11.2%, and in the West portion of our service territory, unemployment stands at 8.3%. This is compared to a
national average of 9.5%.
Let's take a deeper dive into some large industrial sectors on page seven. The top five sectors that are listed on the slide
account for 60% of our industrial gigawatt sales in the second quarter of 2010. As a group, these five sectors were up
9% versus the second quarter of 2009 and reflect a year-to-date recovery of 3%.
The group also saw a 2.3% sequential improvement versus the first quarter of 2010. AEP's total industrial demand
improved 9.6% from the first to second quarter of this year. Notable standouts in these five categories include primary
metals, which are up 14.6% in the second quarter of 2010 versus '09 and .5% year-to-date; chemical manufacturing is
up 10.8% for the quarter and 6.8% for the year-to-date period; and paper manufacturing is up 10% for the quarter and
7.2% for the year-to-date period.
Other notable trends in our top ten industrial classes include plastic and rubber products, which are up 15.2% for the
quarter and 10.7% for the year; transportation is up 10.7% for the quarter and 8.6% for the year; and oil and gas
extraction is up 11% for the quarter and 11.3% for the year.
If you turn to slide eight, we'll take to look at off-system sales gross margin details. You can see that on the top half of
the slide, gross margin from physical sales were up $8 million to 45 million from 37 for the prior period, volumes were
up 10% largely led by a 37% increase in the June volumes, pricing was up 13% versus the year prior period to 35.50 a
megawatt hour versus 31.44 a megawatt hour, and trading and marketing results were lower by $20 million. Similar
results are what we saw in the year-to-date period, where we saw physical off-system sales margins up $27 million,
volumes were up 40% versus last year, AEP/Dayton Hub pricing was up 5% to 37.22 from 35.61 and we also
witnessed lower trading and marketing results by $24 million for the year-to-date period.

Finally, turning to slide nine, if we take a look at what the outlook looks like for the balance of the year period, we
continue to see retail load volume and margin recover slower than we had previously anticipated. We're encouraged by
what we're seeing in industrial and commercial demand, but it's still trailing our forecast for the year. Year-to-date our
total load is up, as we saw, four-tenths of a percent, but our annual load increases were forecasted to be 1.6%. This
would require -- to get to this number would require a balance of the year load growth of 2.8%, and we're just not
seeing that in our service territories. As we just said, off-system sales are flat on a year-to-date basis versus 2009, but
our guidance reflected an $82 million increase to 329 from $247. Prices for the balance of the year 2010 are still greater
than the liquidations of 2009, but they're below our forecast. With that being said, we're encouraged by what we've seen
so far in off-system sales for the month of July.
Rate changes remain on target. As Mike said, we're at about 300 million on our way to the 320 that was reflected in
guidance, and we expect to be able to close the remaining 20 or so million dollars.
We promised to talk in more detail about the O&M cost reduction and restructuring program, and we'll do that in some
detail now. This program includes both labor and non-labor components. I'll talk a little bit about the labor side of the
reductions that we've had.
As you can see, we've reduced or severed 2461 employees and many of you have asked for details of the severances.
The average age of the employee was 57 years; the average years of service was 29 years; the average salary was
74,000, and the O&M to capital split was 75% O&M and the remainder going to capital.
Many of you have asked about the savings associated with the combination of these labor and non-labor savings. For
2010 we expect to be able to realize $150 million of O&M savings, 70 million of which were labor and 80 million of
which we expect to be non-labor. In 2011 we expect to be able to realize $200 million of O&M savings, of which 120
million is labor and 80 million is non-labor. These sustainable O&M savings will help to offset O&M increases in other
categories during future periods.
Mike referenced the operating company refinement model that, operating company refinements that we are going
through. Clearly placing greater responsibility for the spending, investment and the balancing – for balancing spending
and investment with the cash flows and balance sheet strength of the companies at the operating companies will allow
us greater ability to plan, react to changing conditions going forward, and will certainly set us up for future success in
that model.
With that, we are reaffirming our 2010 earnings guidance at $2.80 to $3.20 per share for the factors that we've
mentioned and discussed in the earlier portion of this call.
With that I will turn it back over to the operator for questions. Bob
Q&A

Thank you [Operator Instructions]: And the first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning Dan.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Mike, I was wondering if you could just share some more thoughts on the EPA action around the
[inaudible] coming in the first quarter, and how are you guys looking at the decision of retirements versus more
environmental CapEx upgrades, and what kind of conversations are you having with your regulators, [inaudible] them,
inevitably for a lot more capital and rate increases that are going to come with these rules?

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, that's a perfect question Dan.
The fact of the matter is, as you know, most of those rules will be challenged. When you look particularly at the
transport rule, it affects the states every bit as it affects the operating industrial customers within those states, and we're
beginning through the operating company model to share some of the impacts that this could mean to the various
jurisdictions. Our intent would be to, as you've heard us say many times before, retrofit those plants where capital
investments have already been made and approach the regulator in a very logical way to say, here are the costs
associated with that.
To the extent that you go to a regulator and offer that we'll either A) shut down this plant or replace it with combined
cycle natural gas plant, they will be partners in those decisions without stepping over their regulatory authority line, and
we think that that's an appropriate way to go about it. As you continue to look at the series of events that the EPA has
on their plate to go forward and implement, you really do get to a situation that becomes a bit frightening about the
prospects of the coal fleet to continue to operate throughout the country.
I know that some of my colleagues have talked about this in their earnings call and forecasting 30, 40, 50,000
megawatts of coal fired generation going offline. I think that's no different than the forecast of the nuclear facilities
some years ago as I said. The fact of the matter is baseload generation will be needed, these existing fleets will be
needed, and the EPA's rules will get adjusted to the reality of the economy. I know that some people talk about that as a
massive increase in the commodity cost of electricity, in the next two or three years, as the U.S. economy struggles
going forward, I can't imagine a scenario where those laws and rules will be implemented to the extent that some think
that they might be.
The legislative interference and the ability to slow all of that down, we're seeing it all over the world; the European
Union and many other countries, all dedicated to doing this, that and the other thing, are beginning to look at the
economic ramifications of that. So, our plan has been consistent. We have a series of stations that we're prepared to lay
up, which we've done, and ultimately retire if need be. Those that we are already dedicated to retrofitting and using,
we've taken a long hard look at converting. Natural gas isn't the best option for our customers, but replacing generating
facilities with combined cycle natural gas at those sites where water and electric ingress and egress are there tells us
that that's the approach we ought to take and the one that we will.
We will work all of that in concert with our regulators because our goal isn't to raise the cost of commodity energy,
which some of my colleagues think is a great place to be. Our goal is to continue to improve the environmental
performance of very cost effective power plants, and that's what we're going to continue to pursue. So, this is not some
nightmare scenario that you can say good night to King Coal. That's not going to happen in the United States. That's not
going to happen anywhere in the world.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay. So, Mike your thought process then is it you're going to – this is going to take longer than
probably what the EPA and some of us have been thinking toward. How long do you think it's going to take to get
implemented?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, so let's just think about it. So
the transport rule ultimately comes in in the first stage in 2012, and the actual implementation date is mid 2011. In six
months, you cannot design, contract and build any of the retrofit facilities you would have to do to get there. So the
practical reality of that is we are looking at mid decade before you really see implementation of any of these events that
are going to cause a major, major shift in the generation fleet, and by that time, quite honestly, Dan, if you begin to see
the economy recover, which many people think that you will by the mid decade, hearken back to 2008 when every
power plant that could run was running. Take 10, 15,000 megawatts of power off of here and you're looking at South
Africa, Venezuela and South Korea and the United States being without baseload generation. That is not going to
happen.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay, and then Mike, I guess just one another question. Can you, you know, share with us what
you are hearing from your industrial customers as far as kind of the outlook for the second half of this year? Is the
strength of the second quarter going to continue or is this more of one of these restocking conversations where they're
looking to maybe start slowing down already?

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's probably a bit of the latter.
As you know, there is a great debate whether we'll find a second dip in this recession or whether we'll just flatten out
for a while. I think when you speak to many of our larger industrials, particularly the metal melters that Brian gave us
some granularity over, they're eager. I know the guys at Century would love to get going again. LMEs at $2,000 plus
tells them that the market may be okay for them. Worldwide demand for aluminum continues to grow, but at the same
time there are labor costs. So we've offered them energy prices that should clearly bring them back on line. They need
to address their labor issue.
So it's -- I don't think it's pure restocking. I think they're all being very careful about their inventory levels. Brian said
something about the housing starts, but we all know that the minute the government pulled away the first-time buyer
incentive, the housing starts crashed in June and the same in July. So that's really why we are keeping our guidance
where it is. We see some encouraging signs, but it would be premature to adjust with what we've seen for the first half
of the year.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, you bet Dan.

And next we'll go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Good morning. I have a quick question on the operating company management changes. Is
that – how should we think about that in terms of financial impact? Is this something that is incorporated within the
savings targets that you gave us on the call this morning? Is it something that's going to longer-term generate additional
efficiencies, or is it more of a – sort of strategic and non-financial shift? A bit more color around that and how to bake
it into some of those financial numbers you've put out there?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure, so let me handle the first side
of the strategic, and then I'll ask Brian to address the cost containment and discipline that's associated with it. The
biggest change here is that the capital utilization model for transmission, distribution and generation will be much more
in the control of the operating company president. And the logic for that is -- that goes back to Dan's question about
how we're going to go forward and manage the generation fleet.
In our company, like so many other companies, the generation capital investment dwarfs the transmission investment,
and is just a bit north of what's invested in the distribution assets going forward. So the dialog with the state regulator
again is going to be, for instance, we have a coal production facility in the state of X and we can either retrofit it for Y
dollars with this kind of rate impact or we can replace it with combined cycle natural gas facility for Z dollars with
these kinds of costs to the customers.
All intended to make sure that we have the most cost effective electricity available in your state, governor regulator, so
that you can continue to go draw jobs into your footprint. We think that that strategic alignment and that partnership
and the regulatory compact with the regulator and the executive officers of our 11 jurisdictions will serve us well, our
customers well, the politicos well, and most importantly, our shareholders well, as well. So that's the strategic side of it.
On the financial side of it, Brian why don't you kick in?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, so clearly the strategic
components that Mike referenced are clearly there. There is also tactical financial components of it in that we wouldn't
be able to realize the $150 million in savings this year and the 200 million sustainable savings going forward to offset
other increases if we didn't have the operating company presidents out there working with their colleagues in the
transmission side of the business and the generation side of the business in managing those costs on an operating
company basis.

Clearly, what we're trying to do is to match the cash flows from the operating companies with the balance sheet
strength that we're seeing and allow the operating company presidents to pull the leverage that they need to to optimize
the return on equity at those operating companies. So the model definitely gives us the opportunity to do what we've
been talking about tactically in terms of savings, and we certainly will be able to reap the investment benefits that Mike
laid out for the long term.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Thank you. If I can just follow-up on the -you talked about the 200 million of sustainable
savings to offset other increases, so as we think about 2011 and we think about O&M, should we be thinking around
the incremental savings, '11 over '10, and then normal inflation on everything else, or how should we be starting to
think about modeling that?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's probably a good start
Jonathan. We're going through that process certainly ourselves right now and dispatch this new operating company
model out there to take care of working through those numbers, but I would think that would be a good place to start.
And what I wouldn't want you to do is to take the forecasted O&M that you have in there for 2010 and assume that
$200 million is going to come off the top and that's your 2011 number.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay good.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: That's great. Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: And I would just add to that,
Jonathan, that just keep an eye on the 2 to 4% per year growth rate in earnings. That's what we're managing toward and
that's what we will dedicate ourselves toward delivering to our investors.

And next we go to Greg Gordon of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Hi, how are you doing? If you answered this towards the end of your scripted remarks, I
apologize because my phone cut out for a minute, but can I infer that 150 million in cost savings that you've achieved
through the head count reductions this year is still what you think you need to bring down to the bottom line to offset
the sluggishness you're seeing in other areas of your business vis-à-vis plan to still sort of target the midpoint of the
range for this year in terms of what you are going to deliver to shareholders?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It is Greg. And as we talked about a
little bit in the closing part of the remarks, and I'll just dig in a bit, we're still seeing load recovery below what we had
in guidance. We were looking at for the year load recovery of about 1.6% and year-to-date we're at four-tenths of a
percent, and we just don't see a 2.8% growth for the balance of the year that's going to get us back up to that number.
So the O&M savings will help to offset that. We're watching off-system sales very closely, as we're only at matching
last year's number through half the year. We're seeing a good July, but prices for the balance of the year are off what we
had in guidance, and we are watching that number very closely.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So the cost cutting benefits compensate for those two issues?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.

<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, but if we think about the economic recovery being delayed, but ultimately, hopefully,

Thank you. Next we go to line of Leslie Rich of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning Leslie.
<Q>: Good morning. Brian, I wondered if we could go back to off-system sales and your comments on slide eight, and
I guess I'm just sort of having trouble connecting all the dots. If your volumes are up 10% versus last year and your
pricing is up very nicely, I guess, could you go into why the trading and marketing results are lower. Is that just that
second quarter of 2009 was particularly good or are you seeing any sort of recurring trends, and then I'm sorry if you
already answered this, but your forecast for the full year of 329 million, other than the month of July, which you said is
shaping up well. Why do you still have confidence in that for the full year?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, and that's another piece that I
wouldn't say we have confidence in that for the full year. I think we'll be somewhere in between the 246 or so from last
year and the 329 that was forecast for the balance of the year. So I'm not calling for a hit for that number. I think we'll
be somewhere in between those two numbers.
But Leslie you did point out obviously that the trading and marketing is down, I wouldn't say that's indicative of a
greater trend. It is certainly off versus last year, but you will remember last year a lot of what goes in that business is
both inception gains from long-term transactions that we enter into as well as some of the mark-to-market activity
associated with some of the auctions that we engage in. And there has just been lower deal flow for us around the two
components of that business. So I -- it doesn't reflect a stepping away from that business for us or any longer-term trend
other than what I'd say the deal flow this year is a little bit less than what we saw last year particularly in regards to the
auction business.
<Q>: And do you see any impact from the financial reform legislation vis-à-vis derivatives in terms of your hedging or
trading and marketing businesses?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: At this point Leslie no. We're
waiting to see what happens with the CFTC. As you know, so much of the implementation of that was punted to the
CFTC, and that's where the rulemakings are going to be played out. From the way that things were left and from some
of the letters that we've seen, from some of the members of the committee, we believe that there will be end-user
exemptions, and we don't believe that we'll be in the higher category swap dealer, but that will be an end-user type
exemption, and I think that those, those exemptions that have been talked about will be available to us in the CFTC
rulemakings.
<Q>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<Q - Ali Agha>: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions; one you pointed out that relative to your 320 million rate
increase target, you're at 301 already. Could you just remind us what's out there for the rest of this year that would help
you get there or even cross the line?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I think the most important one
would be the self-implemented number in Michigan. We don't count those in the 301 stack because they are subject to
refund as we go forward, and a couple of other smaller issues that are still in the process at commissions that we think
will get decided. There's some environmental adjustments in Ohio and other jurisdictions that we think will go through
smoothly. So, we again feel very comfortable that we'll hit or exceed that target for the year.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And just to be clear, the Michigan self-implementation, is that already in 301 or you've not counted
on that yet?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Not counted on that yet.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. Second question, Mike, the cost savings are coming in; as you point out, you've got more rate
increases coming in next year, hopefully the forward curves are moving up on off-system sales. I just wanted to be
clear: the 2 to 4% EPS guidance that you talk about, should we be thinking about that for '11 and perhaps '12, or is that
more of a longer term normalized number that you allude to?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think you would be in the
right range if you used that for '11 and '12. When you get beyond that and we finally begin to see some of the
transmission activities kick in, you'd be closer to the upside of that range, and we might expand that. As we've chatted
about before, that could put us in the 4 to 6 range.
But -- as you know and as you've experienced, our view from a conservative Midwest point, is to be conservative and
that's what we've done. And fortunately, we've typically over-delivered and that we would hope to be our case going
forward. I can tell you, when I look at some of my colleagues who have very robust numbers, explaining later on how
you didn't hit them is much more difficult than explaining that we were able to achieve our goals or do a little bit better
than that.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And last question, as I look forward, Mike, if I recall you also had planned about 320 million
for rate increases for '11. Is that still the target and how much of that is secured based on activity that's happened so far?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well that is the basic target, and I'm
sorry I don't have at top of mind the percent that's already in hand, but it's probably 70, 80 million of the 320 give or
take.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: So about a third of it.

<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Good morning. I have a question about the drivers of your long-term growth forecast of 2 to 4%.
What are the key components there? In particular, it seems to me that you've curtailed CapEx to a level where net
CapEx raising rate base over time will only contribute a portion of this. Is the remainder, in your view, going to be a
function of increasing returns on rate base through rate relief and cost reductions. Maybe you could just help me by

kind of breaking out the 2 to 4% growth in terms of your strategy for achieving it?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: So it's interesting, there are probably
three components that makes -- make most of that up. To your point, as you know we depreciate about $1.5 billion a
year. So we're looking at capital expenditures that will allow for earnings growth going forward. Rates of return on
equity are an , but we don't build a lot of forecast into that, and the upside, just believe that we will continue,
particularly with the new operating company model, to continue to enjoy some success in that space. Obviously we
believe that, along with most others, that off-system sales numbers both volumetrically and commodity price-wise will
grow some going forward. If you look at the 2011 strip for gas, which is the real bellwether of where commodity prices
will be, it's a bit stronger than 2010 and so we see some of that as potential.
And then, of course, even in our footprint, we look at something like 1% growth going forward, our Western footprint
going more dramatically than our Eastern footprint. So when you take those three and add to it the discipline of cost
control on the O&M side, we feel pretty comfortable with that 2 to 4 range.
As I mentioned to the question Ali asked, as we begin to get into the mid-term and see the transmission capital
investments starting to impact in a constructive way more so than they have to-date, earnings per share numbers, that
also is in the equation. So again, there are many who would argue that gosh that's not very stretchy, but for a company
like ours with the footprint that we have, we think that that's a very achievable, and I would argue if over a handful of
years we deliver that kind of growth and couple that with our dividend, this is a pretty good investment strategy for
those who are looking for steady, solid, low-risk returns compared to other low-risk options that they have.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Excellent, thank you very much. That's quite helpful actually. Just one quick follow-on question,
I noticed when I compare your year-to-date performance on page 14 of the slide deck with the earnings guidance on
page 17 of the deck, one of the areas where it seems that the company is slightly underperforming its earlier plan is on
the Ohio company's margin. The expectation had been for a margin of about $64 per megawatt hour and it seems in the
first half were coming in at around 58. Is that something you would expect to make up over the remainder of the year or
has there been a change there relative to expectations that it's important to be aware off.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, it's inside of the 2.80 to 3.20
guidance that we're giving you. It's a reality of what we've seen so far in Ohio with the mix of industrial, commercial,
residential demand. But we've built that into the 2010 plan, and we expect that number to rebound some as we look at
2011 and beyond, because there some adjustments that are inside of the ESP. So we continue to feel comfortable with a
range that we're in. That is an area though that, as you surely point out, is underperforming. And that's one of the
reasons that we aren't robust at the second quarter to say gosh we really feel great; let's uptick guidance for the year.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, you bet Wynne – Hugh,
thanks.

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: I think as Brian said to Leslie's
question, we had some auction results that were current in calendar year 2009. And as you know, our tendency is to
take those contracts, cover our basic requirements, and then continually manage the upside potential of fulfilling those
requirements, and our team, as they have been many times before, were very successful in 2009. They don't have those
same auction contracts to deal with in calendar year 2010, because they rolled-off at the mid-year point. So that really
is what Brian was going to. There will be auctions in the future and we always participate in them. We are almost
always successful for a handful of tranches. We draw a line at what spreads we'd like to see from auction successes.
And then the charge to the team is back them up so that there is limited exposure and then manage the upside of the
back-up contracts as we go forward. And we've been very successful at that over a long horizon. We are not big home
run hitters. In our commercial ops group we are very steady, solid performers, and so 2010 as compared to 2009, that's
really the driver.

And next we'll go to the line of Brian Chin, Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian Chin>: Hi good morning. If I remember right, you'd placed several thousand megawatts on temporary
mothball status earlier this year. To what extent are the cost containment efforts that you guys have successfully made
so far related to those mothball plants? And then have you had any changes in terms of when you expect those
mothballs to come back online?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, so phraseology, we call, we laid
them up. And it really is part of the generation contribution to the O&M savings that Brian outlined. And our plan in
this – and this is really a great question, Brian, because it demonstrates some of the flexibility that the American
Electric Power fleet has.
Our plan was to be prepared in a very short period of time to bring any one of those plants online to satisfy the
unexpected weather-related demand or economic recovery demand. And in the last 60 days, we've done that a couple of
times.
What the generation group did was reduce some of the head counts that would normally be stationed at any one of
those facilities, and we've turned them into a roving group of highly experienced folks who can show up at a plant site
and augment the skeletal staff that's there, and bring the plant online within hours. And we've worked that out with the
PJM, and as I said in the last 60 days we've brought some of those plants back online for very important, high price
opportunities. So we're pretty comfortable with the way that that's working, and again it just shows the depth and the
breadth of the skill sets and the human capital that we have here at American Electric Power.
<Q - Brian Chin>: That's very helpful. And then one other unrelated question: can you guys comment on distribution
spending? Are you guys expecting distribution spending to start to ramp-up a little bit more later this year or maybe the
early part of next year, or are your distribution spending forecast largely pretty much set a stone for the time being?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well for 2010, we're pretty much set.
I would tell you that one of the -- there is upsides and downsides of the new operating company model. We have
chosen some very strong operating company presidents and they could spend through $4 billion on distribution every
year if we gave them the freedom to do that, but we clearly won't do that. We'll continue to manage that as we go
forward.

But this goes back to the question maybe that Hugh asked: if you look at our concept going forward regulatory, dollars
spent on the energy delivery system and spent wisely with some early education of the regulator as to the why and the
need and the where, usually yields great regulatory success and will continue to do that. So far this year, quite honestly,
there has been some under-spend in that side as they used a lot of their dollars to satisfy early storm requirements. As
you know, across our entire regulatory portfolio, commissions have been treating storm recovery in a very, very
respectful manner.
There is nothing more in the political world than getting the lights back on that's important to the political team. And
commissions now are being very dutiful, not only in our states, but in other states at allowing for recovery of incurred
costs as we go forward. So we see that again as one of the disciplines of the operating company model. Brian and the
finance team will see to it that we don't overspend the capital forecast and that yields are performance in the 2 to 4%
range.

events; you are right that the Army Corps of Engineers permit is now under challenge. Most of the effect of the Corps
permit, the work in those areas is already done. So I think that the courts will look at that and say, well this is
interesting, but the thing that you're most trying to protect has already been protected. So what is it that you would
seek? Look I – there is no question that the proponents of those kinds of endeavors simply don't want to see any coal
plants built anywhere in the United States. And obviously we are 180 degrees from them in that undertaking.
They should champion an ultra super critical coal plant. This is the technology of the 21st century to continue to have
coal burned around the world. So let me set aside my podium for a moment and then get to the second matter. There
was a huge challenge and another seek of a stay of construction on the transmission lines that was handled by the courts
in Arkansas this week. And it couldn't have come out better: A) no stay; keep building; B) take these things back to the
Commission to verify that the certificates that were issued for the transmission build in fact is exactly what you're
intended to do.
To our opponents I would simply say this, that rest assured when the Turk plant is ready to run, there will be
transmission in and out of the station, because there are some laws that pertain to the United States, not simply to some
very wealthy hunters and environmentalists who, God bless them, are dedicated to seeing no coal plant build anywhere
in the world.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Last one Mike, in terms of Ohio, when do you expect negotiations for ESP version 2
to really heat up?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: I expect you'll see that early in 2011.
As you know it's a March '11 filing. We'll probably have some discussions before we take that approach. In fact, we're
in the midst of discussions with many of our customers today. Look, my large industrial customers, the Office of
Consumer Counsel, they are very desirous of having controlled cost of electricity going forward for the growth in the
Ohio economy and we want the same thing.

So, Michael, I go back to one of my earlier comments. Some of my colleagues think it would be great to see the cost of
electricity go up. We think it would be great to see the cost of electricity be reliable and to be acceptable, and that's
what negotiations for a three-year maybe even a five-year ESP, if we could get to that place, would make sense.
I really do think we need to get some color on SEET, and again I've said many a time, I don't think that that's going to
be some kind of a nightmarish outcome. When we get that color on SEET, hopefully sometime in calendar year 2010,
that will let all of us know how to build that into the 2011 and beyond ESP plan.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Thanks Mike.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, you bet, Michael.

And next we go to the line of Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hi, how are you?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just a follow-up on Ohio first, the SEET filing, the SEET order, I guess, that came out in June;
Duke is asking for a re-hearing. I'm sure you've read it or had it reviewed. What do you think about that and as it
pertains to you? I mean you guys are unhappy with the order, and are you thinking of seeking rehearing?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I had a chance to chat with
some of the commissioners the other day about that. I am not sure what Duke's sought – but they put it in. The
Commission really is doing what you'd expect it to do, which is if people are going to petition to re-hear, let's get that
out of the way before we go forward and actually issue orders on a path that is subject to re-hearing.
We don't intend to do that. We think that there was plenty of flexibility in their June directions to all of us. We were
prepared to file on 15 July. We'll be prepared to file on 1 September. And we'll proceed with our case. If we seek any
review, it would be of some unexpected curve-ball in a SEET order that affected the AEP Ohio companies and we'd
take that to the appropriate court of review which is the Ohio Supreme Court.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. On the O&M reduction, and just to clarify, I guess, the earlier projections that you have
that are in the slide deck, I guess those are subject to change. I mean these are just place holders and you guys might be
-- I mean you guys don't necessarily feel that this is where we're going to be – I mean do I understand that correctly?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Talking about for 2010 guidance?
<Q - Paul Patterson>: You have the 2010, slide 17, I mean it seems that you guys have delivered, but the O&M
number will probably be different than what you're thinking?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. With respect to the O&M savings, how much would you say is in the regulated as
opposed to the non-regulated area?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: The vast majority of it.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I mean I think you know we're like
96% regulated and 4% non. So...

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just finally on the trading and marketing question, what was the, I guess, the
total outlook for trading and marketing that you guys had originally for 2010?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I don't know if we broke that
out separately, Paul, for the year.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, and I think classically we do
not; when you're in the business of trading and marketing, it probably doesn't make much sense to tell your colleagues
what you hope to accomplish.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, but when you guys mentioned that you guys won some contracts and some of the
bidding. Was that because of the accounting associated with that. In other words if you hit a, if you bid into a, into one
of these auctions, you mark-to-market the benefit of that contract over the period of time or is that – because it just
seems like a wide variance for the quarter?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, some of those pieces of
business, we match up against our generating assets and others we'll hedge out, and we'll put those activities that we
hedge out in the trading and marketing side rather than in the physical off-system sales side.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: You bet.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of Andrew Levy, Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.
<Q>: Guys.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q>: I think most of the questions were asked, but I put you back on your soap box, Mike.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Andrew.
<Q>: What your thoughts on renewables going forward? Obviously a lot of talk; we kind of know where Congress is
probably heading, various states have mandates for the next several years that may or may not be able to be made, and
obviously there is a large cost to renewables as well. Do you think the numbers are, whether they're going to be met, or
do you think state legislators, which are probably have a little different opinion than state commissioners at this point?
Do you think the numbers are toned down a little bit and with maybe the cost being the major hurdle, or do you think
the numbers actually are made and we go ahead and do all this renewable stuff?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think you've really raised an
interesting question. When you look at some of the requirements in California, for instance, going to the 33%, I think
that Governor Schwarzenegger and many of the utilities in California see that as a very, very difficult stretch with
substantial impacts on the cost of electricity. But if you look at this in a more macro sense for the conterminous 48
United States, I think things like the Bingaman-Murkowski legislation is the way that the country will go and should
go.
We need to blend some of the requirements for renewable energies into the overall portfolio as we go forward. The
price points are still awkward, but they're trending in the right direction. The technology continues to move forward
aggressively, and I think that that's helpful, and as you know, for us, we believe strongly in the Bingaman approach to
transmission removing the Corker amendment, the crossed allocation that I spoke to at the very beginning of our
conversation. And the FERC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, I think, yields a very logical renewable energy standard
for all of us to find a way to satisfy. I know that those who have commodity plays particularly must run nuclear stations
hate the notion of renewables, but it's going to happen and I know this is also heresy, but nuclear power plants can be

cycled just like coal power plants can be cycled, and they're going to have to get to that place if we are going to
accommodate a large renewable portfolio standard.
We at the Edison Electric Institute, as we've done on many, many other issues, support the Bingaman-Murkowski
model. We don't think it makes sense to have much larger of a demand than that, but the price points will continue to
get better. The combined electrical efficiency of facilities is what it is, but the marrying capacity of energy storage and
supplemental generation will allow us to accommodate those needs as we go forward. So it would be silly for America
to say we don't want to do anything in the renewable space. It would be equally silly to have unachievable numbers
with a penalty associated with them. But the fleet can react to it, and again if you build-out the transmission grid as we
have been proposing now for a number of decades and years, you can accommodate all of this without much of a bump
in the highway.

Thanks Chuck and good morning everyone. Thank you much for joining us for our second quarter update. We had a
$0.74 per share quarter on ongoing earnings, something that we're very pleased with; clearly above what appeared to be
the consensus forecast of how we would do. Really some very interesting load issues that were contributors to that, and
Brian will give you some granularity about that as we go forward.
And like most of the other reporting utilities for the quarter, our best friend has been the weather, and that has been
good to us as well. We've talked at length about how we would manage operating and maintenance expenses at
American Electric Power over the last handful of years, and as we looked at the results of the first quarter and early into
the second quarter, as you know, we decided to take relatively dramatic actions on that front, which will help us not
only in 2010 to achieve our earnings range targets, but should help us going forward for the next two or four-year
cycle, and we feel that our team is prepared to continue to demonstrate the discipline that will get us there.
When we look very closely at 2010, we're confident with our earnings guidance range of 2.80 to 3.20, I'm sure that
many of you might like to tip up on that sub-tail. We don't feel that now is the time to do that. If we decide to make an
adjustment in that guidance range, it would be after we see the third quarter, because again, as Brian will share with
you, there have been some ups, there have been some downs, and there have been some flatness in the demand as we
look at energy consumption throughout the United States, the macro economic issues that you hear about and we hear
about.
Some say no chance for a second dip; some say for sure. Consumer confidence is low. Retail spending is low and many
of the things that we look at and control, those decisions are telling us let's be Midwest conservative, and that's exactly
what we intend to do.
On the regulatory front, we have 300 million rate adjustments in hand to-date, of the 320 million target number that we
began the year with. We feel very, very comfortable with the number of pending issues still being reviewed that will
meet or exceed that $320 million target that we began 2010 with. That really tells you a great deal about the value of
regulatory diversity. We've had some jurisdictions where things have gone surprisingly well, and others where they
haven't gone as well; in fact, have been somewhat disappointing. But the diversity surely has proven to be a benefit as I
know that many of you realize.
In fact, over the last six years, we've either met or exceeded our target because of that regulatory diversity. And I would
argue that that shows some of the logic of the scale and size of the footprint that American Electric Power has.
A couple of specific issues on the regulatory update: The Ohio SEET activity continues apace. As you know, Duke
Energy had sought rehearing on the original order of the SEET structure, and the PUCO decided that it would make no
sense to begin hearings on something that was already up for rehearing, so they intend to settle the rehearing issue first
and then go ahead and process the SEET cases as they suggested. They've moved the filing date to September 1. We're
prepared to file at that time. I continue to believe that no matter what the outcome is, it will be extremely digestible for
us. It will keep us within that 2.80 to 3.20 range, and it will give us a good path forward so that we can stay within the 2
to 4% growth targets that we've spoken to you about as we look at 2011, 2012 and the years beyond.
When it comes to the Turk update, we continue to build on time, under budget, and with as much safety focus as I
would hope you would expect that we would have. And we continue to defend in every court, in every jurisdiction,
wherever those who would not like to see this coal plant built, go forward. I know that you all know that we have
chosen the merchant approach or the non-rate treatment approach with the 88-megawatts that are focused for our
customers in Arkansas and so be it.
We feel that's a very supportable and, in fact, appropriate way to go. We are still going to take the output of the Turk
station to our Louisiana customers and Texas customers, through the certificates that were issued in those states. As I
mentioned, we will continue to defend and continue to build and we know that an ultra super critical plant is necessary
for this country, necessary for our customers, necessary for our company and we will continue to pursue that with all
vigor.
The transmission update is actually beginning to show some signs of encouragement. It's clear to us that the FERC
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is nothing but good news. They will attend to the issue of cost allocation and

ultimately get to the interstate process of saying that facilities that serve the many should be paid for by the many, and
in fact we're comfortable that that's the way that they will go. Their support of the SPP cost allocation method,
something that has been dubbed highway byway, is something that we believe in very strongly, and we think that and
hope that the FERC NOPR will lead us to that point on cost allocations.
There are many in the utility space who would like to argue that that shouldn't be the way. The driver for them is
raising the cost of electricity. The driver for us is lowering the cost of electricity throughout the country, and we think
we will win that event as we go forward.
As to the ability to plan for and get authority to build facilities, we think the FERC NOPR will also address that in a
very strong way. Congress continually suggests to the Chair and others of the FERC commissioners that they have the
authority to do these issues. The NOPR should put more strength behind that authority, and, if need be, ultimately
legislation will support that as well. The rationalization of the power generation fleet in the United States, the
continuing increase with renewable energy will all be served by a more robust transmission grid, something that
American Electric Power has been the champion of for decades, and clearly with the focus in the last handful of years
more comfortable that that's all moving in the right direction.
The PJM decision to one more time ratify that PATH is the best electrical plan as well as economic plan to decongest
much of the PJM, where power prices are substantially different in the Western front versus the Eastern front, was a
good decision. The timeline has been moved up and we're moving apace there as well. There are others who are
making late-in-the-game filings. Those will all go through the PJM process, and that will get sorted out as one would
expect that it should. So when we look at mid-term and long-term plans for our transmission proposals that we've been
active for a number of years, we see it as nothing but good news.
The Federal legislative update is something that I probably could take the rest of the call over. I think it's interesting to
see how this unfolds. We were, along with carbon colleagues, in a number of meetings with members of the United
States Senate on both sides of the aisle, a week ago Tuesday, and there was no consensus among two Democrats, let
alone 60. There was no consensus among two Republicans, let alone 60.
I don't see a horizon where 60 votes come in in favor of a carbon proposal in 2010. The White House has suggested
through the Czar of Energy that if we don't do it in 2010, we probably won't do it until 2013. And I'll let that statement
stand for itself.
It's interesting, as I look back at this industry, I've been at it a long while as I know many of you know. In the 1990s
when I was in New England, it was an assured American gospel that the nuclear fleet would no longer exist by the
early 2000s. All were forecasting the demise of the nuclear fleet, and I'll be darned, that didn't happen.
So here we are in 2010, and everyone is forecasting the demise of the coal fleet, and I would argue as we get to 2015
and 2020 and beyond, the coal fleet too will survive just like the nuclear fleet did, clearly different, clearly cleaner, a bit
more expensive, but nonetheless coal will continue to be a major player in the baseload generation of this country, and
American Electric Power's fleet will be doing just that.
So, when we look at these events, we aren't troubled by them. We will react to them. The EPA is moving forward with
rules and regulations that they feel are verifiable. All of them are under challenge. All of them will remain under
challenge, and eventually Congress will speak to the issue. We are strong supporters of the Rockefeller approach to say
to the EPA: let the legislators, just as the White House has suggested, address all of these issues rather than going
forward in a non-voted-for regulatory scheme that is driven toward the notion of putting this country in a very difficult
baseload power situation. And I expect all of that will move forward in the next few months and the next few years.
Let me dovetail into something that is important for us, and that's the new operating company model. One of the things
that I think our regulatory success has shown over the years is that the focus of attention on the regulator and the
customers in the states that we do business has served us well. As what we intend to do with the reorganization
structure and the cost controls that came from that activity is to put more power in the hands of the in-state operating
company presidents and give them greater line of sight over the capital expenditures.

I know that Brian has talked to many of you at length about that, and it's a project and an undertaking that we feel
strongly about. We think that it will continue to allow for a much clearer line of sight for states as they look at the
environmental challenges going forward and the decisions that need to be made as to whether one would retrofit a plant
or replace that plant with a combined cycle natural gas facility. So we feel very comfortable about the plans that we are
pursuing. We feel comfortable about 2010 guidance. We feel comfortable about our 2 to 4% earnings growth strength
at American Electric Power as we look at the next few handful of years, and we feel comfortable that the U.S Congress
will not allow the lights to go out in this great country.
With that I'll get off my soap box and turn it over to Brian. Brian.
Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Mike. If we can turn to slide four, we'll take a look at the quarter-on-quarter comparisons. AEP's ongoing
earnings for the second quarter of this year were $355 million an increase of $34 million over the last year's result of
$321 million, which was $0.68 per share. This year we are reporting $0.74 per share for the second quarter. Let me take
you through the factors that account for the changes.
The share count increase accounted for a negative penny for the quarterly comparison, reflecting 479 million average
shares outstanding this year versus 472 million in 2009. Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.03 per share or 22
million. These rate changes came from multiple of our jurisdictions reflecting the jurisdictional diversity that Mike
referenced.
Retail margin, which reflects retail sales at our utilities, net of rate, weather and firm wholesale load effects, accounted
for positive $0.05 per share or $33 million. Firm wholesale load, which reflects long term sales to utility and municipal
systems, accounted for a negative $0.03 per share or 22 million and reflects the loss of two wholesale customers. Since
the economy is not recovering as fast as we would like, weather has been our friend this year accounting for a positive
$0.05 per share or $34 million versus last year.
Off system sales net of sharing accounted for negative $0.02 per share or 12 million compared to the second quarter of
last year. We'll discuss these results further on slide eight.
O&M expenses net of revenue offsets accounted for a positive comparison to last year of $0.07 per share or $51
million. 33 million was associated with under-spend at our distribution operations and 25 million of that was associated
with the recent storm cost deferral order. The remaining dollars were associated with lowered expenses in plant
maintenance and lower expenses associated with the head count reduction across all of our companies.
Other utility operations net reflects negative $0.10 per share or 75 million and primarily reflects the absence of Cook
accidental outage insurance for 46 million, higher interest expense of 10 million, higher depreciation and amortization
expenses of 6 million and a higher effective tax and other taxes of 13 million.
Finally, non-utility operations/parent accounted for positive $0.02 per share or 12 million and primarily reflects the
gain on our remaining investment in the Intercontinental exchange.
Turning to slide five, you'll see that for the year-to-date, AEP is reporting ongoing earnings of $720 million, an
increase of $39 million over last year's result of 681 million, which was $1.55 per share. This year we are reporting
$1.50 year-to-date, and I'll take you through the factors that account for that change. We've had an increase in shares
outstanding which accounted for negative $0.14 per share. This reflects average shares outstanding of 479 million this
year versus 440 million last year.
Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.17 per share or 112 million and also came from the multiple jurisdictions as
was the case in the quarterly comparison. Retail margins were up 21 million or $0.03 per share due to recovery across
all customer classes, and I'll talk more about load on the next two slides.
Firm wholesale margin accounted for negative $0.07 per share, or $46 million in the year-to-date period. As was the
case in the quarterly period, weather was a positive contributor versus last year's results accounting for $0.11 per share

or $71 million.
Off system sales net of sharing was flat, and we usually don't have flat comparisons in these waterfall type discussions,
but we are going to have some more discussions about that on a later slide. O&M expenses net of revenue offset
accounted for a positive $0.10 per share or $66 million and is driven primarily by the same factors that I reported in the
second quarter reconciliation.
Other utility operations net accounted for a negative $0.24 or $185 million and is comprised of the following
contributors. Cook accidental outage insurance of 99 million, higher depreciation and amortization expenses of 31
million, higher interest expenses of 25 million, a higher effective tax rate of 14 million and higher other taxes of $11
million.
Let's turn to slide 6 and take a look at the normalized load trends. The top left hand side of the slide you will see that
residential sales on a normalized basis were up three-tenths of a percent for the quarter and up 1.1% for the year-to-date
period. Residential customer accounts are improving modestly and housing starts were actually up 20% versus the
second quarter of 2009.
AEP Commercial normalized -- commercial normalized sales, the top right hand side of the slide, were up 2% for the
quarter and are now up three-tenths of a percent for the year-to-date period. They tell us that commercial sales lag
going into and coming out of a recession and we're encouraged by what we see in the commercial sales category.
In the bottom left hand side of the slide, you'll see that industrial normalized sales were up 9.4% for the quarter and
they're now up 4.2% for the year-to-date period. Excluding a large -- two large aluminum customers in the East, the
quarterly number would have been up 12% and the year-to-date number would have been up 8%. We'll discuss
industrial sales more on the next slide.
Finally, on the bottom right hand side, you'll see total normalized sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and up four-tenths
of a percent for the year-to-date period. This includes the firm wholesale loads that we discussed earlier in the call.
Finally, unemployment in our service territories continues to struggle. In our East service territories, unemployment
stands at 11.2%, and in the West portion of our service territory, unemployment stands at 8.3%. This is compared to a
national average of 9.5%.
Let's take a deeper dive into some large industrial sectors on page seven. The top five sectors that are listed on the slide
account for 60% of our industrial gigawatt sales in the second quarter of 2010. As a group, these five sectors were up
9% versus the second quarter of 2009 and reflect a year-to-date recovery of 3%.
The group also saw a 2.3% sequential improvement versus the first quarter of 2010. AEP's total industrial demand
improved 9.6% from the first to second quarter of this year. Notable standouts in these five categories include primary
metals, which are up 14.6% in the second quarter of 2010 versus '09 and .5% year-to-date; chemical manufacturing is
up 10.8% for the quarter and 6.8% for the year-to-date period; and paper manufacturing is up 10% for the quarter and
7.2% for the year-to-date period.
Other notable trends in our top ten industrial classes include plastic and rubber products, which are up 15.2% for the
quarter and 10.7% for the year; transportation is up 10.7% for the quarter and 8.6% for the year; and oil and gas
extraction is up 11% for the quarter and 11.3% for the year.
If you turn to slide eight, we'll take to look at off-system sales gross margin details. You can see that on the top half of
the slide, gross margin from physical sales were up $8 million to 45 million from 37 for the prior period, volumes were
up 10% largely led by a 37% increase in the June volumes, pricing was up 13% versus the year prior period to 35.50 a
megawatt hour versus 31.44 a megawatt hour, and trading and marketing results were lower by $20 million. Similar
results are what we saw in the year-to-date period, where we saw physical off-system sales margins up $27 million,
volumes were up 40% versus last year, AEP/Dayton Hub pricing was up 5% to 37.22 from 35.61 and we also
witnessed lower trading and marketing results by $24 million for the year-to-date period.

Finally, turning to slide nine, if we take a look at what the outlook looks like for the balance of the year period, we
continue to see retail load volume and margin recover slower than we had previously anticipated. We're encouraged by
what we're seeing in industrial and commercial demand, but it's still trailing our forecast for the year. Year-to-date our
total load is up, as we saw, four-tenths of a percent, but our annual load increases were forecasted to be 1.6%. This
would require -- to get to this number would require a balance of the year load growth of 2.8%, and we're just not
seeing that in our service territories. As we just said, off-system sales are flat on a year-to-date basis versus 2009, but
our guidance reflected an $82 million increase to 329 from $247. Prices for the balance of the year 2010 are still greater
than the liquidations of 2009, but they're below our forecast. With that being said, we're encouraged by what we've seen
so far in off-system sales for the month of July.
Rate changes remain on target. As Mike said, we're at about 300 million on our way to the 320 that was reflected in
guidance, and we expect to be able to close the remaining 20 or so million dollars.
We promised to talk in more detail about the O&M cost reduction and restructuring program, and we'll do that in some
detail now. This program includes both labor and non-labor components. I'll talk a little bit about the labor side of the
reductions that we've had.
As you can see, we've reduced or severed 2461 employees and many of you have asked for details of the severances.
The average age of the employee was 57 years; the average years of service was 29 years; the average salary was
74,000, and the O&M to capital split was 75% O&M and the remainder going to capital.
Many of you have asked about the savings associated with the combination of these labor and non-labor savings. For
2010 we expect to be able to realize $150 million of O&M savings, 70 million of which were labor and 80 million of
which we expect to be non-labor. In 2011 we expect to be able to realize $200 million of O&M savings, of which 120
million is labor and 80 million is non-labor. These sustainable O&M savings will help to offset O&M increases in other
categories during future periods.
Mike referenced the operating company refinement model that, operating company refinements that we are going
through. Clearly placing greater responsibility for the spending, investment and the balancing – for balancing spending
and investment with the cash flows and balance sheet strength of the companies at the operating companies will allow
us greater ability to plan, react to changing conditions going forward, and will certainly set us up for future success in
that model.
With that, we are reaffirming our 2010 earnings guidance at $2.80 to $3.20 per share for the factors that we've
mentioned and discussed in the earlier portion of this call.
With that I will turn it back over to the operator for questions. Bob
Q&A

Thank you [Operator Instructions]: And the first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning Dan.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Mike, I was wondering if you could just share some more thoughts on the EPA action around the
[inaudible] coming in the first quarter, and how are you guys looking at the decision of retirements versus more
environmental CapEx upgrades, and what kind of conversations are you having with your regulators, [inaudible] them,
inevitably for a lot more capital and rate increases that are going to come with these rules?

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, that's a perfect question Dan.
The fact of the matter is, as you know, most of those rules will be challenged. When you look particularly at the
transport rule, it affects the states every bit as it affects the operating industrial customers within those states, and we're
beginning through the operating company model to share some of the impacts that this could mean to the various
jurisdictions. Our intent would be to, as you've heard us say many times before, retrofit those plants where capital
investments have already been made and approach the regulator in a very logical way to say, here are the costs
associated with that.
To the extent that you go to a regulator and offer that we'll either A) shut down this plant or replace it with combined
cycle natural gas plant, they will be partners in those decisions without stepping over their regulatory authority line, and
we think that that's an appropriate way to go about it. As you continue to look at the series of events that the EPA has
on their plate to go forward and implement, you really do get to a situation that becomes a bit frightening about the
prospects of the coal fleet to continue to operate throughout the country.
I know that some of my colleagues have talked about this in their earnings call and forecasting 30, 40, 50,000
megawatts of coal fired generation going offline. I think that's no different than the forecast of the nuclear facilities
some years ago as I said. The fact of the matter is baseload generation will be needed, these existing fleets will be
needed, and the EPA's rules will get adjusted to the reality of the economy. I know that some people talk about that as a
massive increase in the commodity cost of electricity, in the next two or three years, as the U.S. economy struggles
going forward, I can't imagine a scenario where those laws and rules will be implemented to the extent that some think
that they might be.
The legislative interference and the ability to slow all of that down, we're seeing it all over the world; the European
Union and many other countries, all dedicated to doing this, that and the other thing, are beginning to look at the
economic ramifications of that. So, our plan has been consistent. We have a series of stations that we're prepared to lay
up, which we've done, and ultimately retire if need be. Those that we are already dedicated to retrofitting and using,
we've taken a long hard look at converting. Natural gas isn't the best option for our customers, but replacing generating
facilities with combined cycle natural gas at those sites where water and electric ingress and egress are there tells us
that that's the approach we ought to take and the one that we will.
We will work all of that in concert with our regulators because our goal isn't to raise the cost of commodity energy,
which some of my colleagues think is a great place to be. Our goal is to continue to improve the environmental
performance of very cost effective power plants, and that's what we're going to continue to pursue. So, this is not some
nightmare scenario that you can say good night to King Coal. That's not going to happen in the United States. That's not
going to happen anywhere in the world.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay. So, Mike your thought process then is it you're going to – this is going to take longer than
probably what the EPA and some of us have been thinking toward. How long do you think it's going to take to get
implemented?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, so let's just think about it. So
the transport rule ultimately comes in in the first stage in 2012, and the actual implementation date is mid 2011. In six
months, you cannot design, contract and build any of the retrofit facilities you would have to do to get there. So the
practical reality of that is we are looking at mid decade before you really see implementation of any of these events that
are going to cause a major, major shift in the generation fleet, and by that time, quite honestly, Dan, if you begin to see
the economy recover, which many people think that you will by the mid decade, hearken back to 2008 when every
power plant that could run was running. Take 10, 15,000 megawatts of power off of here and you're looking at South
Africa, Venezuela and South Korea and the United States being without baseload generation. That is not going to
happen.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay, and then Mike, I guess just one another question. Can you, you know, share with us what
you are hearing from your industrial customers as far as kind of the outlook for the second half of this year? Is the
strength of the second quarter going to continue or is this more of one of these restocking conversations where they're
looking to maybe start slowing down already?

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's probably a bit of the latter.
As you know, there is a great debate whether we'll find a second dip in this recession or whether we'll just flatten out
for a while. I think when you speak to many of our larger industrials, particularly the metal melters that Brian gave us
some granularity over, they're eager. I know the guys at Century would love to get going again. LMEs at $2,000 plus
tells them that the market may be okay for them. Worldwide demand for aluminum continues to grow, but at the same
time there are labor costs. So we've offered them energy prices that should clearly bring them back on line. They need
to address their labor issue.
So it's -- I don't think it's pure restocking. I think they're all being very careful about their inventory levels. Brian said
something about the housing starts, but we all know that the minute the government pulled away the first-time buyer
incentive, the housing starts crashed in June and the same in July. So that's really why we are keeping our guidance
where it is. We see some encouraging signs, but it would be premature to adjust with what we've seen for the first half
of the year.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, you bet Dan.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Good morning. I have a quick question on the operating company management changes. Is
that – how should we think about that in terms of financial impact? Is this something that is incorporated within the
savings targets that you gave us on the call this morning? Is it something that's going to longer-term generate additional
efficiencies, or is it more of a – sort of strategic and non-financial shift? A bit more color around that and how to bake
it into some of those financial numbers you've put out there?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure, so let me handle the first side
of the strategic, and then I'll ask Brian to address the cost containment and discipline that's associated with it. The
biggest change here is that the capital utilization model for transmission, distribution and generation will be much more
in the control of the operating company president. And the logic for that is -- that goes back to Dan's question about
how we're going to go forward and manage the generation fleet.
In our company, like so many other companies, the generation capital investment dwarfs the transmission investment,
and is just a bit north of what's invested in the distribution assets going forward. So the dialog with the state regulator
again is going to be, for instance, we have a coal production facility in the state of X and we can either retrofit it for Y
dollars with this kind of rate impact or we can replace it with combined cycle natural gas facility for Z dollars with
these kinds of costs to the customers.
All intended to make sure that we have the most cost effective electricity available in your state, governor regulator, so
that you can continue to go draw jobs into your footprint. We think that that strategic alignment and that partnership
and the regulatory compact with the regulator and the executive officers of our 11 jurisdictions will serve us well, our
customers well, the politicos well, and most importantly, our shareholders well, as well. So that's the strategic side of it.
On the financial side of it, Brian why don't you kick in?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, so clearly the strategic
components that Mike referenced are clearly there. There is also tactical financial components of it in that we wouldn't
be able to realize the $150 million in savings this year and the 200 million sustainable savings going forward to offset
other increases if we didn't have the operating company presidents out there working with their colleagues in the
transmission side of the business and the generation side of the business in managing those costs on an operating
company basis.

Clearly, what we're trying to do is to match the cash flows from the operating companies with the balance sheet
strength that we're seeing and allow the operating company presidents to pull the leverage that they need to to optimize
the return on equity at those operating companies. So the model definitely gives us the opportunity to do what we've
been talking about tactically in terms of savings, and we certainly will be able to reap the investment benefits that Mike
laid out for the long term.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Thank you. If I can just follow-up on the -you talked about the 200 million of sustainable
savings to offset other increases, so as we think about 2011 and we think about O&M, should we be thinking around
the incremental savings, '11 over '10, and then normal inflation on everything else, or how should we be starting to
think about modeling that?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's probably a good start
Jonathan. We're going through that process certainly ourselves right now and dispatch this new operating company
model out there to take care of working through those numbers, but I would think that would be a good place to start.
And what I wouldn't want you to do is to take the forecasted O&M that you have in there for 2010 and assume that
$200 million is going to come off the top and that's your 2011 number.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay good.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: That's great. Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: And I would just add to that,
Jonathan, that just keep an eye on the 2 to 4% per year growth rate in earnings. That's what we're managing toward and
that's what we will dedicate ourselves toward delivering to our investors.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: You bet.
Operator
And next we go to Greg Gordon of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Hi, how are you doing? If you answered this towards the end of your scripted remarks, I
apologize because my phone cut out for a minute, but can I infer that 150 million in cost savings that you've achieved
through the head count reductions this year is still what you think you need to bring down to the bottom line to offset
the sluggishness you're seeing in other areas of your business vis-à-vis plan to still sort of target the midpoint of the
range for this year in terms of what you are going to deliver to shareholders?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It is Greg. And as we talked about a
little bit in the closing part of the remarks, and I'll just dig in a bit, we're still seeing load recovery below what we had
in guidance. We were looking at for the year load recovery of about 1.6% and year-to-date we're at four-tenths of a
percent, and we just don't see a 2.8% growth for the balance of the year that's going to get us back up to that number.
So the O&M savings will help to offset that. We're watching off-system sales very closely, as we're only at matching
last year's number through half the year. We're seeing a good July, but prices for the balance of the year are off what we
had in guidance, and we are watching that number very closely.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So the cost cutting benefits compensate for those two issues?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.

<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, but if we think about the economic recovery being delayed, but ultimately, hopefully,
happening, just not on the schedule that you had anticipated. This does create, doesn't it, some operating leverage that
would otherwise not have existed because the cost cuts have now been put in place?

Operator
Thank you. Next we go to line of Leslie Rich of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning Leslie.
<Q>: Good morning. Brian, I wondered if we could go back to off-system sales and your comments on slide eight, and
I guess I'm just sort of having trouble connecting all the dots. If your volumes are up 10% versus last year and your
pricing is up very nicely, I guess, could you go into why the trading and marketing results are lower. Is that just that
second quarter of 2009 was particularly good or are you seeing any sort of recurring trends, and then I'm sorry if you
already answered this, but your forecast for the full year of 329 million, other than the month of July, which you said is
shaping up well. Why do you still have confidence in that for the full year?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, and that's another piece that I
wouldn't say we have confidence in that for the full year. I think we'll be somewhere in between the 246 or so from last
year and the 329 that was forecast for the balance of the year. So I'm not calling for a hit for that number. I think we'll
be somewhere in between those two numbers.
But Leslie you did point out obviously that the trading and marketing is down, I wouldn't say that's indicative of a
greater trend. It is certainly off versus last year, but you will remember last year a lot of what goes in that business is
both inception gains from long-term transactions that we enter into as well as some of the mark-to-market activity
associated with some of the auctions that we engage in. And there has just been lower deal flow for us around the two
components of that business. So I -- it doesn't reflect a stepping away from that business for us or any longer-term trend
other than what I'd say the deal flow this year is a little bit less than what we saw last year particularly in regards to the
auction business.
<Q>: And do you see any impact from the financial reform legislation vis-à-vis derivatives in terms of your hedging or
trading and marketing businesses?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: At this point Leslie no. We're
waiting to see what happens with the CFTC. As you know, so much of the implementation of that was punted to the
CFTC, and that's where the rulemakings are going to be played out. From the way that things were left and from some
of the letters that we've seen, from some of the members of the committee, we believe that there will be end-user
exemptions, and we don't believe that we'll be in the higher category swap dealer, but that will be an end-user type
exemption, and I think that those, those exemptions that have been talked about will be available to us in the CFTC
rulemakings.
<Q>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<Q - Ali Agha>: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions; one you pointed out that relative to your 320 million rate
increase target, you're at 301 already. Could you just remind us what's out there for the rest of this year that would help
you get there or even cross the line?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I think the most important one
would be the self-implemented number in Michigan. We don't count those in the 301 stack because they are subject to
refund as we go forward, and a couple of other smaller issues that are still in the process at commissions that we think
will get decided. There's some environmental adjustments in Ohio and other jurisdictions that we think will go through
smoothly. So, we again feel very comfortable that we'll hit or exceed that target for the year.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And just to be clear, the Michigan self-implementation, is that already in 301 or you've not counted
on that yet?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Not counted on that yet.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. Second question, Mike, the cost savings are coming in; as you point out, you've got more rate
increases coming in next year, hopefully the forward curves are moving up on off-system sales. I just wanted to be
clear: the 2 to 4% EPS guidance that you talk about, should we be thinking about that for '11 and perhaps '12, or is that
more of a longer term normalized number that you allude to?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think you would be in the
right range if you used that for '11 and '12. When you get beyond that and we finally begin to see some of the
transmission activities kick in, you'd be closer to the upside of that range, and we might expand that. As we've chatted
about before, that could put us in the 4 to 6 range.
But -- as you know and as you've experienced, our view from a conservative Midwest point, is to be conservative and
that's what we've done. And fortunately, we've typically over-delivered and that we would hope to be our case going
forward. I can tell you, when I look at some of my colleagues who have very robust numbers, explaining later on how
you didn't hit them is much more difficult than explaining that we were able to achieve our goals or do a little bit better
than that.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And last question, as I look forward, Mike, if I recall you also had planned about 320 million

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well that is the basic target, and I'm
sorry I don't have at top of mind the percent that's already in hand, but it's probably 70, 80 million of the 320 give or
take.

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Hugh.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Good morning. I have a question about the drivers of your long-term growth forecast of 2 to 4%.
What are the key components there? In particular, it seems to me that you've curtailed CapEx to a level where net
CapEx raising rate base over time will only contribute a portion of this. Is the remainder, in your view, going to be a
function of increasing returns on rate base through rate relief and cost reductions. Maybe you could just help me by

kind of breaking out the 2 to 4% growth in terms of your strategy for achieving it?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: So it's interesting, there are probably
three components that makes -- make most of that up. To your point, as you know we depreciate about $1.5 billion a
year. So we're looking at capital expenditures that will allow for earnings growth going forward. Rates of return on
equity are an , but we don't build a lot of forecast into that, and the upside, just believe that we will continue,
particularly with the new operating company model, to continue to enjoy some success in that space. Obviously we
believe that, along with most others, that off-system sales numbers both volumetrically and commodity price-wise will
grow some going forward. If you look at the 2011 strip for gas, which is the real bellwether of where commodity prices
will be, it's a bit stronger than 2010 and so we see some of that as potential.
And then, of course, even in our footprint, we look at something like 1% growth going forward, our Western footprint
going more dramatically than our Eastern footprint. So when you take those three and add to it the discipline of cost
control on the O&M side, we feel pretty comfortable with that 2 to 4 range.
As I mentioned to the question Ali asked, as we begin to get into the mid-term and see the transmission capital
investments starting to impact in a constructive way more so than they have to-date, earnings per share numbers, that
also is in the equation. So again, there are many who would argue that gosh that's not very stretchy, but for a company
like ours with the footprint that we have, we think that that's a very achievable, and I would argue if over a handful of
years we deliver that kind of growth and couple that with our dividend, this is a pretty good investment strategy for
those who are looking for steady, solid, low-risk returns compared to other low-risk options that they have.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Excellent, thank you very much. That's quite helpful actually. Just one quick follow-on question,
I noticed when I compare your year-to-date performance on page 14 of the slide deck with the earnings guidance on
page 17 of the deck, one of the areas where it seems that the company is slightly underperforming its earlier plan is on
the Ohio company's margin. The expectation had been for a margin of about $64 per megawatt hour and it seems in the
first half were coming in at around 58. Is that something you would expect to make up over the remainder of the year or
has there been a change there relative to expectations that it's important to be aware off.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, it's inside of the 2.80 to 3.20
guidance that we're giving you. It's a reality of what we've seen so far in Ohio with the mix of industrial, commercial,
residential demand. But we've built that into the 2010 plan, and we expect that number to rebound some as we look at
2011 and beyond, because there some adjustments that are inside of the ESP. So we continue to feel comfortable with a
range that we're in. That is an area though that, as you surely point out, is underperforming. And that's one of the
reasons that we aren't robust at the second quarter to say gosh we really feel great; let's uptick guidance for the year.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, you bet Wynne – Hugh,
thanks.

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: I think as Brian said to Leslie's
question, we had some auction results that were current in calendar year 2009. And as you know, our tendency is to
take those contracts, cover our basic requirements, and then continually manage the upside potential of fulfilling those
requirements, and our team, as they have been many times before, were very successful in 2009. They don't have those
same auction contracts to deal with in calendar year 2010, because they rolled-off at the mid-year point. So that really
is what Brian was going to. There will be auctions in the future and we always participate in them. We are almost
always successful for a handful of tranches. We draw a line at what spreads we'd like to see from auction successes.
And then the charge to the team is back them up so that there is limited exposure and then manage the upside of the
back-up contracts as we go forward. And we've been very successful at that over a long horizon. We are not big home
run hitters. In our commercial ops group we are very steady, solid performers, and so 2010 as compared to 2009, that's
really the driver.

And next we'll go to the line of Brian Chin, Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian Chin>: Hi good morning. If I remember right, you'd placed several thousand megawatts on temporary
mothball status earlier this year. To what extent are the cost containment efforts that you guys have successfully made
so far related to those mothball plants? And then have you had any changes in terms of when you expect those
mothballs to come back online?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, so phraseology, we call, we laid
them up. And it really is part of the generation contribution to the O&M savings that Brian outlined. And our plan in
this – and this is really a great question, Brian, because it demonstrates some of the flexibility that the American
Electric Power fleet has.
Our plan was to be prepared in a very short period of time to bring any one of those plants online to satisfy the
unexpected weather-related demand or economic recovery demand. And in the last 60 days, we've done that a couple of
times.
What the generation group did was reduce some of the head counts that would normally be stationed at any one of
those facilities, and we've turned them into a roving group of highly experienced folks who can show up at a plant site
and augment the skeletal staff that's there, and bring the plant online within hours. And we've worked that out with the
PJM, and as I said in the last 60 days we've brought some of those plants back online for very important, high price
opportunities. So we're pretty comfortable with the way that that's working, and again it just shows the depth and the
breadth of the skill sets and the human capital that we have here at American Electric Power.
<Q - Brian Chin>: That's very helpful. And then one other unrelated question: can you guys comment on distribution
spending? Are you guys expecting distribution spending to start to ramp-up a little bit more later this year or maybe the
early part of next year, or are your distribution spending forecast largely pretty much set a stone for the time being?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well for 2010, we're pretty much set.
I would tell you that one of the -- there is upsides and downsides of the new operating company model. We have
chosen some very strong operating company presidents and they could spend through $4 billion on distribution every
year if we gave them the freedom to do that, but we clearly won't do that. We'll continue to manage that as we go
forward.

But this goes back to the question maybe that Hugh asked: if you look at our concept going forward regulatory, dollars
spent on the energy delivery system and spent wisely with some early education of the regulator as to the why and the
need and the where, usually yields great regulatory success and will continue to do that. So far this year, quite honestly,
there has been some under-spend in that side as they used a lot of their dollars to satisfy early storm requirements. As
you know, across our entire regulatory portfolio, commissions have been treating storm recovery in a very, very
respectful manner.
There is nothing more in the political world than getting the lights back on that's important to the political team. And
commissions now are being very dutiful, not only in our states, but in other states at allowing for recovery of incurred
costs as we go forward. So we see that again as one of the disciplines of the operating company model. Brian and the
finance team will see to it that we don't overspend the capital forecast and that yields are performance in the 2 to 4%
range.

And next we'll go to line of Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning Michael.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Good morning Mike. Real quick question on Turk; what's the latest in terms of the last round
of litigation filed? I think they've now turned to the water permit and the Army Corps of Engineers process for
reviewing that permit. Just curious how and when you think this plays out?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well actually there are two current
events; you are right that the Army Corps of Engineers permit is now under challenge. Most of the effect of the Corps
permit, the work in those areas is already done. So I think that the courts will look at that and say, well this is
interesting, but the thing that you're most trying to protect has already been protected. So what is it that you would
seek? Look I – there is no question that the proponents of those kinds of endeavors simply don't want to see any coal
plants built anywhere in the United States. And obviously we are 180 degrees from them in that undertaking.
They should champion an ultra super critical coal plant. This is the technology of the 21st century to continue to have
coal burned around the world. So let me set aside my podium for a moment and then get to the second matter. There
was a huge challenge and another seek of a stay of construction on the transmission lines that was handled by the courts
in Arkansas this week. And it couldn't have come out better: A) no stay; keep building; B) take these things back to the
Commission to verify that the certificates that were issued for the transmission build in fact is exactly what you're
intended to do.
To our opponents I would simply say this, that rest assured when the Turk plant is ready to run, there will be
transmission in and out of the station, because there are some laws that pertain to the United States, not simply to some
very wealthy hunters and environmentalists who, God bless them, are dedicated to seeing no coal plant build anywhere
in the world.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Last one Mike, in terms of Ohio, when do you expect negotiations for ESP version 2
to really heat up?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: I expect you'll see that early in 2011.
As you know it's a March '11 filing. We'll probably have some discussions before we take that approach. In fact, we're
in the midst of discussions with many of our customers today. Look, my large industrial customers, the Office of
Consumer Counsel, they are very desirous of having controlled cost of electricity going forward for the growth in the
Ohio economy and we want the same thing.

So, Michael, I go back to one of my earlier comments. Some of my colleagues think it would be great to see the cost of
electricity go up. We think it would be great to see the cost of electricity be reliable and to be acceptable, and that's
what negotiations for a three-year maybe even a five-year ESP, if we could get to that place, would make sense.
I really do think we need to get some color on SEET, and again I've said many a time, I don't think that that's going to
be some kind of a nightmarish outcome. When we get that color on SEET, hopefully sometime in calendar year 2010,
that will let all of us know how to build that into the 2011 and beyond ESP plan.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Thanks Mike.

And next we go to the line of Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hi, how are you?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Good.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just a follow-up on Ohio first, the SEET filing, the SEET order, I guess, that came out in June;
Duke is asking for a re-hearing. I'm sure you've read it or had it reviewed. What do you think about that and as it
pertains to you? I mean you guys are unhappy with the order, and are you thinking of seeking rehearing?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I had a chance to chat with
some of the commissioners the other day about that. I am not sure what Duke's sought – but they put it in. The
Commission really is doing what you'd expect it to do, which is if people are going to petition to re-hear, let's get that
out of the way before we go forward and actually issue orders on a path that is subject to re-hearing.
We don't intend to do that. We think that there was plenty of flexibility in their June directions to all of us. We were
prepared to file on 15 July. We'll be prepared to file on 1 September. And we'll proceed with our case. If we seek any
review, it would be of some unexpected curve-ball in a SEET order that affected the AEP Ohio companies and we'd
take that to the appropriate court of review which is the Ohio Supreme Court.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. On the O&M reduction, and just to clarify, I guess, the earlier projections that you have
that are in the slide deck, I guess those are subject to change. I mean these are just place holders and you guys might be
-- I mean you guys don't necessarily feel that this is where we're going to be – I mean do I understand that correctly?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Talking about for 2010 guidance?
<Q - Paul Patterson>: You have the 2010, slide 17, I mean it seems that you guys have delivered, but the O&M
number will probably be different than what you're thinking?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. With respect to the O&M savings, how much would you say is in the regulated as
opposed to the non-regulated area?

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just finally on the trading and marketing question, what was the, I guess, the
total outlook for trading and marketing that you guys had originally for 2010?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I don't know if we broke that
out separately, Paul, for the year.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, and I think classically we do
not; when you're in the business of trading and marketing, it probably doesn't make much sense to tell your colleagues
what you hope to accomplish.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, but when you guys mentioned that you guys won some contracts and some of the
bidding. Was that because of the accounting associated with that. In other words if you hit a, if you bid into a, into one
of these auctions, you mark-to-market the benefit of that contract over the period of time or is that – because it just
seems like a wide variance for the quarter?
<A - Brian X. Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, some of those pieces of
business, we match up against our generating assets and others we'll hedge out, and we'll put those activities that we
hedge out in the trading and marketing side rather than in the physical off-system sales side.

<Q>: I think most of the questions were asked, but I put you back on your soap box, Mike.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Andrew.
<Q>: What your thoughts on renewables going forward? Obviously a lot of talk; we kind of know where Congress is
probably heading, various states have mandates for the next several years that may or may not be able to be made, and
obviously there is a large cost to renewables as well. Do you think the numbers are, whether they're going to be met, or
do you think state legislators, which are probably have a little different opinion than state commissioners at this point?
Do you think the numbers are toned down a little bit and with maybe the cost being the major hurdle, or do you think
the numbers actually are made and we go ahead and do all this renewable stuff?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think you've really raised an
interesting question. When you look at some of the requirements in California, for instance, going to the 33%, I think
that Governor Schwarzenegger and many of the utilities in California see that as a very, very difficult stretch with
substantial impacts on the cost of electricity. But if you look at this in a more macro sense for the conterminous 48
United States, I think things like the Bingaman-Murkowski legislation is the way that the country will go and should
go.
We need to blend some of the requirements for renewable energies into the overall portfolio as we go forward. The
price points are still awkward, but they're trending in the right direction. The technology continues to move forward
aggressively, and I think that that's helpful, and as you know, for us, we believe strongly in the Bingaman approach to
transmission removing the Corker amendment, the crossed allocation that I spoke to at the very beginning of our
conversation. And the FERC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, I think, yields a very logical renewable energy standard
for all of us to find a way to satisfy. I know that those who have commodity plays particularly must run nuclear stations
hate the notion of renewables, but it's going to happen and I know this is also heresy, but nuclear power plants can be

cycled just like coal power plants can be cycled, and they're going to have to get to that place if we are going to
accommodate a large renewable portfolio standard.
We at the Edison Electric Institute, as we've done on many, many other issues, support the Bingaman-Murkowski
model. We don't think it makes sense to have much larger of a demand than that, but the price points will continue to
get better. The combined electrical efficiency of facilities is what it is, but the marrying capacity of energy storage and
supplemental generation will allow us to accommodate those needs as we go forward. So it would be silly for America
to say we don't want to do anything in the renewable space. It would be equally silly to have unachievable numbers
with a penalty associated with them. But the fleet can react to it, and again if you build-out the transmission grid as we
have been proposing now for a number of decades and years, you can accommodate all of this without much of a bump
in the highway.
