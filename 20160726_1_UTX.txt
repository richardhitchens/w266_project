Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. So a really solid Q2 and a great start to the year. With these results,
we're very, very comfortable with our long-term outlook and we continue to be on track to the 2020 growth target that
we laid out back in March of this year. As I told you previously, we are focused on execution and delivering on our
commitments. The old UTC of under promise and over deliver is our goal again.
And we're seeing the results of that focus reflected in our Q2 performance. Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.82 on almost $15
billion of sales. Through the first half, adjusted earnings per share are up 6% on 2% organic sales growth. We're also of
course raising the bottom end of our guidance by $0.15. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.45 to $6.60 and we're also
increasing the bottom end of our sales expectations. We now see 2016 sales of $57 billion to $58 billion. That's up from
our previous expectations of $56 billion to $58 billion. And we continue to expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in what
remains a low growth and volatile macro environment.
I'll turn it over to Akhil and Paul in a moment to walk you through details but four key takeaways from today.
First of all, execution remains our top priority. The Geared Turbofan is performing exceptionally well in service, 99.8%
dispatch reliability with over 5,000 revenue hours and four operators. We're meeting our commitments on fuel burn,
noise and emissions.
Second, we continue to invest and innovate for growth. CCS has introduced several new innovative residential
products, and we recently announced Otis partnership with Microsoft and AT&T to collaborate on digital solutions that
will enhance connectivity and the customer experience.
Third, we're also of course seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts and we remain focused on cost reduction,
structural cost reduction. CCS expanded margins by an exceptional 130 basis points in the quarter and corporate
expenses were nearly 20% lower versus last year.
Number four, finally, we continue to stay disciplined with our capital and evaluate the best ways to utilize our cash to
maximize share and value. We'll complete the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan in the third quarter, and
we're on track to return $22 billion in cash to shareowners from 2015 through 2017. And we recently announced two
strategically important acquisitions that are right in the core of our business. Otis will acquire Schindler's service
business in Japan and CCS acquired a 70% stake in Riello which is a heating and cooling business in Europe. This will
enhance our offerings to our European customers. Just exactly as we said, in the core and disciplined.
These are just a few of the many examples of why we're executing our key priorities. Let me turn it over to Akhil and
Paul to take you through the results and I'll be back in a moment with some closing comments. Akhil?
Akhil Johri
Thank you, Greg. Taking a look at slide two, organic sales were up 1% in the quarter. Most recent data on the U.S.
economy continues to be encouraging. Consumer spending remains strong and job creation, wage growth and
unemployment trends point to a steady growth environment, although more likely in the 2% GDP growth range as
opposed to the 3% plus that we would all like to see.
During the second quarter, our commercial businesses saw 3% growth in the Americas, driven by Otis which was up
10%. Sales at CCS were flat as lower commercial HVAC exports and field and security sales were offset by 3% growth
in U.S. residential HVAC. Looking at Europe and the Middle East, sales were flat at both Otis and CCS, reflecting little
change in the trends or the macro conditions. While Brexit has caused some uncertainty in the region, we don't expect a
near-term impact in our businesses.
In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices particularly in the tier 1 cities show growth
year-to-date, the elevator new equipment market is down and price pressure has increased. For Asia as a whole, sales
were down 3% principally driven by China. We're consistent with our expectations. We saw sales at Otis decline 7%

while CCS sales in China were down 2%.
Commercial aerospace sales growth of 7% was primarily driven by another strong aftermarket quarter at Pratt and mid
single-digit growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket at Aerospace Systems. On the military side, sales were
down 8% driven by original equipment declines at Pratt, primarily due to headwinds from the F117 program, where as
you know, engine production finished in Q1 this year and declines in the Aerospace Systems aftermarket as the C-5
nacelle retrofit program is now complete.
Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide three. Just as a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a
constant currency basis as we usually do. So, at Otis, new equipment orders were down 4%, driven by China where
orders were down 14 % on a dollar basis. They were up 4% on a unit basis however. Excluding China, new equipment
orders at Otis were up 3% with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA in both cases off tough compares.
Total equipment orders at CCS were down 4%, driven by transport refrigeration which was down almost 30%. Recall
that in Q2 of 2015, Carrier Transicold was up almost 30%. Excluding transport refrigeration, orders were flat in the
quarter. Low to mid single-digit growth in fire and security and commercial refrigeration orders was offset by a high
single-digit decline in commercial HVAC entirely due to Europe and the Middle East. Commercial HVAC equipment
orders in the Americas were up low single-digit with mixed single-digit growth in Asia. While U.S. residential HVAC
sales, and that is what we include in the total equipment orders metric, were up 3%, orders were actually up 11% in the
quarter.
Moving to aerospace. At UTC Aerospace Systems, after a slow start in Q1, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5%,
and Pratt & Whitney saw another quarter of very strong commercial aftermarket sales, up 20% driven primarily by the
V2500.
Moving to slide four. Total reported sales of $14.9 billion were up 1% versus the prior year as one point of organic
growth and 1% from acquisitions were offset by a point of headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS of $1.82
was up 9%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.71 which included $0.11 of restructuring and other onetime significant
items.
As Greg said, we continue to focus on cost control and you will see that our restructuring spend year-to-date is about
$180 million. Based on the first half spend, we now expect our full year restructuring to be approximately $400 million,
down from the $500 million previously discussed. However, we will still realize the expected savings as we have been
able to successfully divest a couple of businesses which were on the restructuring list and we have been disciplined
about not fully replacing voluntary attrition.
Free cash flow was 100% of net income in the quarter, driven by strong working capital performance in our
commercial businesses, partially offset by the continued aero ramp-related investments at Pratt & Whitney. As Greg
said, we have increased the full year outlook and now expect sales of $57 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range
of $6.45 to $6.60. With a solid first half, we are confident in raising the low end of the EPS range by $0.15 and we still
have about $75 million of contingency at the higher midpoint of $6.53. We continue to expect organic sales growth of
1% to 3% and full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100%.
There are some puts and takes within the business unit guidance that Paul will go through, but as we look to the
remainder of the year, we expect the businesses to generate slightly higher earnings in the second half as compared to
the first half. We will also benefit from slightly lower share count in the second half. However, this will be entirely
offset by higher interest expense in the second half compared to the first half as well as some higher second half
expenses below the segment. As a result, second half earnings per share are likely to be around the same level as the
first half earnings per share. Bottom line is that we feel very good about our improved outlook for the year.
Looking beyond 2016, we continue to see macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures. Two watch items that have
recently come on the radar screen after Brexit. One, general strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and second, lower yields
on both long and short bonds. As you know, lower discount rates could have a significant impact on our pension
expense for 2017 and beyond. While it is still too early, as a reminder, every 10 basis points change in the discount rate
is around a $30 million profit impact.

With that, let me hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail.
Paul Lundstrom
Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I'm on page five. And please note, I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency and
adjusted to exclude restructuring charges and other significant items as we usually do. Also note, we've included an
appendix on page 11 with additional segment data that you can use as a reference. Hopefully, that's helpful.
In the quarter, Otis sales were $3.1 billion. That was up 2% at constant currency. Otis profit at nearly $600 million was
down 4%. Continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, coupled with additional E&D investments, more than offset
contribution from higher volume. Foreign exchange translation was a 2-point headwind to sales and a 1-point headwind
to earnings.
New equipment sales increased 2%, led by 24% growth in North America. The North America new equipment business
continues to benefit from the strong orders intake we've seen over the last few years, particularly in office space and
hospitality. China new equipment sales were in line with expectations, down 9% in the quarter.
Otis service sales were up 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales
were up slightly in the quarter. Better than expected foreign exchange translation -- based on better than expected
foreign exchange translation, we now expect full year operating profit at Otis to be down between $150 million and
$200 million. That's a $50 million improvement from the guidance that we laid out in December on low single-digit
organic sales growth.
On the next page, climate controls and security sales were up 1% at constant currency with 2 points of growth from
acquisitions, the majority of which came from the acquisition of Riello. That growth was – that growth from
acquisitions was partially offset by a 1% organic sales decline. Profits were up 8% at constant currency. FX translation
was a 1-point headwind for both sales and profits.
As with Otis, you can find global segment data in the appendix, but to call out a few highlights, during the quarter, we
saw 3% organic sales growth in North America residential HVAC. As you heard us discuss midway through the second
quarter, we had a slow start to the cooling season but sales picked up significantly in June. In fact, for residential it was
the best June we've seen in about seven years. On the other hand, following the weak orders we saw in Q1, Transicold
sales were down 6% in the quarter. Weak freight rates in the global shipping lines continued to put pressure on the
container business which was down 39%.
Despite a softer top line, CCS continue to deliver profit growth. Earnings were up 8%, driven by benefits from lower
commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Although operating margins grew to a record
20.4%, we continue to invest in product development, holding E&D to prior year levels. For the year, although first
half organic growth was weaker than expected with easier back half compares, continued productivity momentum, and
favorable foreign exchange translation, we continue to expect operating profit growth of $100 million to $150 million
at actual FX on low single-digit organic sales at Climate, Controls & Security.
Turning to aerospace on slide seven. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.8 billion were up 4% organically. This was driven by
another strong commercial aftermarket quarter, up 20% including 3 points of benefit from a sale of legacy hardware.
Strong V2500 activity drove the growth in the form of both pre-buy from a service bulletin and also from where we are
in the cycle for this engine. The average age of the V2500 fleet is now about nine years old and that's a sweet spot for
overhaul activity, and we continue to see RPM growth. In the large commercial engine business, Geared Turbofan
shipments in the quarter were higher than in Q1, but less than we expected back in March. Although it's safe to say that
our customers would love to take additional engines this year, we continue to expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines
in 2016.
For Pratt Canada, engine shipments were down versus the prior year as we continue to see weaker demand in the
general aviation and helicopter markets. Pratt operating profit was $452 million, down 8%. Drop through from the

strong aftermarket volume and benefits from pension and FX were more than offset by headwinds from higher negative
engine margin, adverse military mix and higher E&D.
We also made some additional investments to support the industrial ramp. The absence of last year's gain from a
product line sale and contract closeouts were a headwind, but were offset by favorable contract settlements in the
legacy hardware sale I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we now expect the commercial aftermarket to be up mid
single-digit. Drop through from that higher aftermarket volume will be more than offset, however, by headwinds from
lower than expected military sales, fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments, higher E&D and the additional ramp-related
investments. Add it all up and we now expect operating profit for the year to be down $50 million to $100 million at
Pratt & Whitney.
At Aerospace Systems, operating profit increased 2% on 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led
by commercial OE, up 5% with growth on next-generation platforms partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial
aftermarket volumes accelerated as anticipated, also up 5% and included growth in parts, provisioning and repair.
Consistent with our full year outlook, the growth we saw in commercial OE and aftermarket was partially offset by a
mid single-digit decline in military. Military OE sales declines were driven by continued lower legacy fighter trainer
and transport programs, while the military aftermarket decline was driven largely by the expected completion of the
C-5 Nacelle retrofit program.
Operating profit growth was driven by strong conversion on higher commercial aftermarket sales, pension tailwind and
continued cost reduction progress. As expected, headwinds included adverse military OE mix, primarily from declines
in legacy program rates and lower military volume. With first half results largely in line with our expectations and
improving organic growth profile and solid execution on cost reduction initiatives, we continue to expect full year
operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thanks, Paul. So encouraging start to the year with 2% organic growth and slightly better than expected
earnings. Based on this first half, we feel very good about the year. We obviously raised the low end of the guidance by
$0.15. We took up the revenue, low end of the revenue guidance, so again, very comfortable about the year. But as
Akhil noted, let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a lot of uncertainty and volatility in the global macro
environment and this is a long journey. And we've laid out a plan through 2020 and we feel very confident about that
plan.
For the meantime though, we're going to remain focused on our key priorities. That's cost reduction, always doing more
with less. Investing an innovation for growth. We'll be disciplined in our capital allocation. Most importantly, we're
going to focus on executing out the record aero backlog. As I said many times before, I've never been more confident in
UTC's long-term outlook. With the aero backlog and the investments we've made on all of our businesses, we continue
to be set up for above GDP growth, well into the future.
With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions. Karen?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Just a quick question on Pratt. You had good aftermarket growth, but the organic growth
was well below that aftermarket growth. So what shrunk in the quarter to kind of offset what happened in the
aftermarket??
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. The – if you'll notice, Ron, the commercial OE shipments were lower than last year. Also, on
the military OE side, we had fewer engine shipments and then Pratt Canada OE shipments were lower as well. So I
think it is more about the OE story where commercial was – commercial and military OE was down.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay. Great. Super, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hi. Thank you. My question would be on Otis. So Otis China, you seem to see the price mixed
delta get quite a bit worse in Q2 than Q1, similar to the market leader there, I think price mix must have been down sort
of high teens against [ph] nine (21:04) in Q1. So I guess the price mix headwind for the year in EBIT is probably bigger
than what you guided back in December and March. What are the sort of offsets in the organic earnings guide in Otis?
Is it cost cutting or Europe after market?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah, Julian, first of all, even though the delta between the value at 14% down versus units up 4%
feels large, 18 points, only half of that is pricing. Rest had to do with more the mix, if you will, right. We had last year's
significant major projects at higher value per unit and this year that's not been the case. So it's about 9% price out of
that delta which is a couple of points worse than what we saw in first quarter, not the dramatic number that you would
conclude without having this context. And so it's not – I mean, overall, we think pricing for China this year is just
slightly worse for the P&L impact for this year. Yes, the margin and backlog is a little worse than what we were
expecting. But offset to that, as always in China is to greater cost reduction from suppliers. Price pressure in China is
not new. Otis is very used to dealing with that. They also can get significant cost reductions on suppliers. And that's
what they will do.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the aerospace OEMs? And we saw a
supplier yesterday talk about slow payments, I know that they've been pushing change in terms, and just if you can talk
a little bit about that. Just I noticed the receivables were up about $600 million sequentially, not sure if that plays into it
at all, but just what's happening from the OEM customers?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, Sam, it's Greg. I would say the pressure on cost continues unabated at the OEM levels.
We have [ph] Scope Program (23:02) currently in Airbus to – we've talked to Boeing about Partnering for Success 2.0.
There's obviously a lot of pressure in a very competitive environment to reduce costs and we obviously are working
with the customers to find ways to take cost out of the product. But it's got to be win-win for us. As far as the payment
terms, I know there's been some talk out there. We have not seen any extension of payment terms beyond that which
we have in the contract. And we have general terms agreements with both Boeing and Airbus and they pay to those
terms. So we have not really seen any big deterioration in receivables as it relates to any or either the operators.

<A - Akhil Johri>: Just to clarify, Sam, the increase in receivables that you referred to, some of it has to do with the
acquisition that we had and also we had a very strong June as Paul referred to in the script. So, when you have late sales
in the quarter, you tend to have more receivables because you just haven't had enough time to collect it as part of your
normal terms.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, strong residential HVAC sales in June.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Okay, Sam.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Hey, I was hoping to ask a, I guess a multifaceted question on cash. Thank you for the
pension color on the P&L. But just thinking about cash this year and into next year, can you give us an update on what,
if any, cash call the pension could have next year? And then, Akhil, it was interesting that structuring is coming down a
bit. Is there some cash use relief there? And then finally, cash working capital, actually looked okay in the quarter
relative to what I was expecting. How does that play out over the rest of the year and maybe the ability to whittle away
at some of the safety stocks into next year?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Great, great question, Jeff. Good to see the focus on cash. But clearly, I think on pension side, we
have no mandatory requirements to fund. Of course, depending on where the discount rate ends up on December 31,
the pension deficit could be a little worse than what we reported at the end of December last year. But definitely, there
is no mandatory requirement for us to fund domestic pension, pension plan. We will evaluate it as part of our normal
cash utilization capital deployment plan and see if we need to do anything on a voluntary basis, but no call on it.
The second question was about restructuring. It's not a meaningful change, Jeff. The $100 million reduction that I
talked about for the year, essentially was keeping the savings intact, could benefit a little bit on the cash side, but again,
that's small and doesn't play out in one year, it generally plays out over a couple of years.
And finally, on the working capital, as you know, I think it's – Greg had mentioned many times, we are not satisfied
with where our working capital is, but we also understand the need to make up for some of the weaknesses we still
have on our supply chain side through buffer stock and that is not necessarily going to come down that quickly. It is
probably a multi-year effort as we get our suppliers to performing in goal levels which are very high standards by the
way, right. We want people to have 95% or more on-time delivery and less than 500 PPM on quality. All that says is
that, in order to meet our customer commitments, we will continue to have a little bit of buffer stock for a year or two
more.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: And just a quick one. Is there anything non-operational in the Otis margin? Thank you.
<A - Akhil Johri>: No, not this quarter.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thank you.

<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. I'm going to try to stick to one question. And just to talk about this
investment in Pratt, Greg, how do you see that paying out over time? Or are the returns occurring in time?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, Howard, as you know, this is a – it's an expensive game in the commercial engines
business. And I've said before we're going to invest or we have invested about $10 billion in CapEx and R&D over the
last dozen years or so to bring the products to market. The good news is, at the end of the year, we should have all of
the aircraft engines certified. We'll get Irkut. We'll get MRJ. We'll get Embraer. So the big phase of investment is really
– will slow down after this year. We're not done. But in terms of the major spending, we should start to see that turn
down. At the same time, as you know, we're going to see an uptick in negative engine margin. And as I look out over
the next ten years or so, you're going to see a big number there, close to another $10 billion of negative engine margin
on all of these platforms. That's going to step up in the next couple of years to get to about $1 billion in 2018. And
they'll stay about that level. Even though production rates will increase, costs will come down but that is a significant
investment.
The good news of course is the aftermarket will come. As we saw this quarter on the V, when the engines get out there,
that six-year, seven-year, eight-year timeframe, the engines do need to be overhauled. We will see the returns. But this
is not a – it's not a short-term gain. These are 30-year programs. The returns remain on track to what we had expected
which is well in excess of our cost of capital. But it's not for the faint of heart either, as you know, Howard. And we're
in for the long-term. We've got great engines. The performance has been phenomenal out of the box. Right now, our
focus is just on delivering engines and then servicing them for the next 25 years or 30 years.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Steve.
<A - Paul Lundstrom>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey, Paul, thanks for all the detail on slide 11, very value-add.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Okay, good. Thanks.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: On CC&S, what is the now commodity spread for the year and what was it in the
quarter?
<A - Akhil Johri>: So it was $50 million, good news in the quarter. This was probably the best quarter from
commodities' point of view. For the full year, we expect about $125 million. That's CCS.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: And is that a change from what you guys had had before?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Just slightly higher, not meaningful. Aluminum has been slightly better than we expected and that's
showing up, but maybe $20 million to $25 million, not too much.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I'll give you a little more breakdown on that, Steve. When we talked about our
guidance for CCS for the year, we had commodities and price together. So there is a price offset there in the second
half. So it won't see quite as much tailwind as the $125 million.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then just on the transport and – sorry, that's price costs, that's not just
commodities, right?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Correct.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then just on the transport business, you mentioned the container business
was down substantially. What was kind of like core U.S. truck trailer down? And could you just remind us of, I know
that's a profitable business, just the margin profile and the mix within there because your margin was really good
despite transport being down. So, obviously, it wasn't a mixed drag that you weren't able to overcome.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, sure. So, if you look back a few years ago, the Transicold business, there was some
disparity in margins amongst the different segments. Container was quite high and North America truck trailer was
quite low. And that's changed over the years. If you look at the average margin, it's sort of at the CCS broader average
today, and there's no major difference between the different segments. A little bit of color just on the quarter, North
America truck trailer was essentially flat, but orders were down similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Looking
ahead to the second half of the year, at least for the North America truck trailer piece, we're largely booked for the third
quarter as we should be at this point. So I would say we're okay.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to go back to the military business for a moment, Pratt and
UTAS. Akhil, you did a nice job of explaining some of the puts and takes there, but I was wondering if you could
perhaps let us know when you feel like you're going to have kind of a clean comp on a year-over-year basis, given the
C-17 and the C-5. And then you – is that the first quarter 2017, I guess, is the question. And then on Pratt, you
suggested that it was worse than expected this quarter on military. Can you just dive a little bit deeper on why it was
worse than expected? Thanks.
<A - Akhil Johri>: So the first question in terms of when do we expect the turn in the military side, I think on Pratt
probably 2016 is most likely a low point because of the mix shift that we have talked about and reduction in the F117
engines. First quarter next year, you will see improvement there on the F117 compares. For UTAS, the C-5 that we
have talked about, that was – we saw some benefit of that in first quarter this year as well. So that two compares would
become easier starting second quarter of 2017 onwards.
For this quarter, slightly weaker than Pratt expectations. Actually, a lot of it was in line with what we expected. I didn't
necessarily say it was hugely weaker than expected, it was – the slight shortfall was on the OE shipment side which
were down year-over-year, partly due to what our production schedule was and partly due to some parts availability.
But overall, it is okay.
Karen, next question please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning. And I'll echo the comments on slide 11, very helpful. Unfortunately, it's
taken half our questions, but...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: [ph] That'll keep your workforce down (33:10).
<Q - Nigel Coe>: I'm sure that was the reason, Paul. Just what – I mean sounds like the news flow on the neo engine
was positive from Farnborough. Can you maybe just comment on that, Greg, and just give us an update on the quarterly
phasing for the engines shipments in the back half of this year? And on top of that, does that place additional pressure

on Pratt margins versus 2Q?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Nigel, I think – as you saw it coming out of the airshow, we had a very productive airshow
from an orders standpoint, a couple of big orders. Right now, we stand at about 8,200 firm and option orders for the
GTF and I think the operators, as I said, they all seem to love the engine. The dispatch reliability is good, so things look
very positive from that standpoint. As far as production, I think it was Akhil or I guess Paul mentioned, going to build
about 140 engines in the back half of the year. That will probably be spread pretty evenly over both of the next two
quarters. That's up from what, 36 engines I think. We built 60 engines, 36 got delivered in the first half. So production
ramp is continuing as we expect. A little pressure on negative margin in the back half of the year as we ramp up. But
the good news is we're coming down the cost curve exactly as we had expected. We look at it every month. We look at
it by engine. We're right on that 87% learning curve that Bob Leduc laid out earlier this year. So we feel good about the
cost of the engines. We feel good about the ramp. Always a challenge, but we're working through it.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Great. Thanks, Greg.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Greg, I wondered if you could expand on that a little bit? It looked like on the commercial
OEM revenues, you were sort of off tens of millions, but the op profit delta year-over-year was probably more like
$150 million or $200 million with Pratt being the vast majority of that. I wondered if you could speak to – are you
seeing higher losses per engine or is there a non-recurring cost element and that just seemed like a pretty large number
there on a year-over-year basis.
<A - Akhil Johri>: So I think the best way to answer that, Carter, would be to give you the EBIT roadmap, if you will,
for Q2 for Pratt, right? So the negative engine margin, first of all, is exactly in line with what we expected. It's not
higher than what – there are some additional ramp up costs that Paul referred to. But overall, we got about $120 million
good news year-over-year on commercial aftermarket. Plus, we had another $55 million or so of good news between
pension and E&D – sorry, pension and FX. Those were offset, so $175 million of good news offset by $70 million of
negative engine margin, $50 million on the military mix issue that we've talked about before, F117 principally and
others, another $35 million net of pension increase in E&D and then the rest about $50 million plus on Pratt Canada OE
shipment reduction and the ramp up cost that we've talked about. So that's essentially the makeup of the Pratt earnings
as to why Pratt earnings were down in spite of good strong commercial aftermarket.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think it's important, Carter, to point out, Pratt is doing what they need to do in terms of
investing in the ramp. We've added about 400 people to the supply chain this year to make sure that the suppliers have
adequate plans in place to deliver on their commitments for the ramp, and some of that investment that we're making
will continue out into next year. It's a little bit more than we had originally expected, but it's what we need to do to
make sure we get these engines out on time. So a little bit higher investment, but tracking exactly where we expected
on cost.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Perfectly clear. Thanks for detail, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Carter.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thanks so much. So it sounds like what you're saying is you expect now to deliver 175
engines versus 200. How are you doing on the supply chain because I know that's been an issue? And where are you
with all the little technical issues? The start time, the error messages on the engines and when do you expect to have
those behind you?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Let's be clear on the production. We're going to build, deliver 200 engines this year. We built
60 in the first half of the year. We're going to build about 140 in the back half of the year which is exactly what we
talked about or Bob Leduc talked about back in March. So, timing of revenue recognition might be a little bit different
as I said. I think we actually revenue-recognized about 36 in the first half. Again, there's engines that are sitting there
on the docks, sitting in transit. So feel good about the build plan. We're not going to come off of the 200. As far as the
supply chain goes, there are always challenges. But if you think about this, with 8,000 parts and about 800 different
subassemblies in this engine, there's a handful of parts that are causing some pain in the supply chain right now, and
Bob and the team are all over this and we will get through this. On the technical stuff, I would tell you it's in the
rearview mirror, Cai. The start time with the software drops have been pretty well addressed. The nuisance faults are
behind us. As I said, 99.8% dispatch reliability with the four operators over 5,000 hours of revenue service since its
introduction back in January. So the engine is performing exactly as we had expected and no surprises on cost, no
surprises on delivery.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: How come you're only – you missed by – I guess you delivered 36 but you built 60. How
come, given Airbus claims they want to have the engines, how come you were not able to ship more?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, they don't all go to Airbus, keep in mind. Some go to Embraer, some go to
Bombardier, some go to MRJ. There's also a large number of spares that we built in the first half of the year to support
the in-service fleet. So it's not just production there. Obviously, Airbus would like engines sooner, but we're exactly on
the production plan we committed to them earlier this year.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Cai.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Noah.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Greg, you mentioned a few times through the call your confidence in your two 2020 revenue
growth targets. And I look at the slide from the investor day, there's some pretty strong rates in there. It's a low of 4%
and a high of 10%, depending on the segment and all kind of blends to 5% to 6%. And I guess the numbers you
reported today are pretty good, but we're still walking along these low single-digit organic revenue growth levels. Not a
ton of reason, I don't think, to expect 2017 to materially accelerate from 2016, correct me if that's wrong. So you would
kind of need 2018, 2019, 2020 to be growing high single digits organically. Is that realistic? And what makes that
happen outside of the macro getting better?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: You know I think you need to break that down, as you mentioned with the four segments. I
would tell you I got the highest confidence in Pratt and in UTAS, just based on the backlog and the skylines coming out
of Boeing and Airbus. We know the aircraft are going to be built. We've got those in backlog. So Pratt should see close
to 10% organic growth. Keep in mind 200 GTF this year then 400 then 800, we're ramping up to almost 1,500 engines.
So you will see growth accelerate on the GTF on all those platforms. And while the V goes away, that gets more than
replaced with volumes with the neo, plus you've got volumes on Embraer, C-series, MRJ. All of those things give us
really high confidence on the organic outlook at Pratt, and similarly at UTAS where the Aerospace Systems grew.
They've got line of sight probably the 5% to 7% organic growth over this time period.

The commercial businesses could be more challenging. I think that is the one soft spot. We saw CCS this quarter down
1% organically, Otis only up 2%, but we're making the right investments. We're spending money on E&D, on new
products. We're spending money on digital at the commercial side to enhance growth. So I still see a clear pathway.
Now, again, we assume the world's going to grow at 3%, not 2%, and if the world grows at 3% and we can get a little
share with these products, we can be in that 4% to 5% range as we move towards 2017, 2018. But, clearly, it's more of
a challenge on the commercial side. At the same time, keep in mind, the urbanization trends continue. The growth of
the middle class continues. All of those things favor the commercial products. People need air conditioners. People
need elevators. So we're confident in the product mix and in the growth outlook.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Noah, one additional data point on the UTAS business, I think we've talked about this, the content
per aircraft is significantly higher on the new platform than the platforms that are being replaced as we've talked about
going from 2 million per chipset to 4 million per chipset. So, even if the production rate of the aircraft does not increase
too much, just the change in the introduction of the new platforms is going to increase the UTAS sales in any case. So I
think aerospace side, as Greg said, very high level of confidence. You don't have to go out and compete those every
day again for the 2020 skyline, it's more the commercial businesses.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: That's helpful. And, Akhil, what's now in the 2016 guidance for euro, dollar?
<A - Akhil Johri>: It's $1.10.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: So no change. Or I'm sorry, you were at $1 before, correct?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Right. And that's part of the reason why we have increased our bottom end and also the Otis
guidance if you will. And because...
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay.
<A - Akhil Johri>: ...the euro has been around $1.12 or so for the first six months and we're expecting $1.10 for the
next six months.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Understood. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Noah.

Thank you. And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question. Our next
question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Banc.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Myles.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: I think you said that aftermarket's now mid single-digit growth that with Pratt in the
plan which probably gives you north of $150 million of additional EBIT, but the segment came down $50 million. So
$200 million of higher EBIT in there being absorbed I guess by E&D and ramp costs, is that how you'd characterize it?
<A - Akhil Johri>: So let's do the full year math on [ph] EBIT Pratt, EBIT, right (44:10).
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Yes, please. Thanks.
<A - Akhil Johri>: So commercial aftermarket would give probably $125 million of good news versus what we
expected.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Yeah.

<A - Akhil Johri>: That would be offset by $50 million more in E&D, $50 million lower from military business and
the remaining $75 million from the fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments plus the additional ramp costs that we talked
about. So three high level things offsetting the good news from commercial aftermarket.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Got it. That's perfect. And then if you think about, Greg, you said the – this is a
follow-up to the same question. When you said that the certification of the engines are all done this year, E&D, how
quickly does that drop over the next couple of years? Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think the roadmap has us going down about $250 million over the next three years as we
look at the R&D. Again, just because the engine's certified doesn't mean all the flight testing's done. So there still is
significant cost out there and we're not going to stop investing in the technology either. We're not going to go to zero.
But clearly, you can expect to see it probably in that 4% to 5% range as a percentage of sales going forward.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Great, thanks.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Paul Lundstrom>: Good morning, David.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Greg, I wanted to touch on Otis' new equipment in North America. The orders were up this
quarter, but I think the smallest kind of increase we've seen in quite a while. Could you just frame the North American
new equipment market and do you think we've kind of peaked out there in terms of order rate? Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Just to be clear, the U.S. order rate was actually up I think about 6% in the quarter. Canada
was down big. There were some big projects that didn't repeat year-over-year. But we still see growth in the backlog at
Otis this quarter in North America. So has it peaked out? I don't know if it's peaked. It's clearly back to where it was in
2007 which is good news. It'll probably – we won't certainly see double-digit growth. We're not expecting double-digit
growth over the next year or two.
<A - Akhil Johri>: In the back half, David, you're right. There were some very strong orders in Otis North America
last year like the Hudson Yards. So we – in the back half, we saw almost 50% growth in North American orders last
year, and that clearly is going to be tough compares to jump off of, so don't be surprised if the orders in North America
are down year-over-year in the back half. Again, very robust economy, things still look pretty good. The good news is
that the orders from what we have seen over the last several quarters are converting into sales now. So the new
equipment sales are very strong in North America and we expect that to continue for a period of time.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thanks for the color.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, David.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: On Otis and CC&S, after a few years of cost focus, you've talked about the need to spend
more on product development in each of those business areas. Could you give us a sense of where that spending is

going to occur and is this something we should see over the next couple years? And then see a margin benefit
subsequently? Could you give us a sense of what that trajectory would be for the two businesses?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Right. So we talked about Otis spending only about 1% of sales on E&D, and a very small
part of that was on actual new product. Most of the E&D historically has been on cost production. We can see that
doubling over the next couple of years. We saw E&D up this quarter at Otis. We'll continue to see it grow over the next
couple of years. They're investing in a couple of different things.
First of all, refreshing the aesthetics in the cab, very important. We're doing that across the globe, and that's done in
each individual market. We're also investing in high rise newbuild technology and looking at ways to again enhance the
offering on the service side. So investments in new equipment, investments in service technology, investments in
service productivity tools. On CCS, they've already doubled E&D over the last four years or five years. It's right about
2% of sales. It should continue at that level. The focus there is really on the large commercial chillers where we had not
had a competitive offering for a number of years. Reinvesting in that business, we continue the see big opportunities in
the big chiller side. But it will take several years and some additional R&D expenditures to get the product line where
we need it to be.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Are these levels that you expect to continue as sort of a natural level for investment in
these businesses or would there be a margin benefit that we would expect in a couple years down the road?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: You know what, I think, Doug, you've got to continue at this kind of 2% level of sales.
Think about $30 billion commercial business, 2% of sales is about $600 million a year. It's not an unreasonable amount
of money. And I want to – these are long-term businesses. You have to continue to invest. So, if I'm looking for margin
opportunities on the commercial businesses, it's going to come from improving productivity on the service side at Otis
and it's going to come from cost reduction on the CCS side.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: R&D was up $30 million year-over-year, Greg, and you've talked about it being up at Pratt,
Otis. Can you break out how much it was up in each of the sectors?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. So I mean the number I quoted on Pratt, up $35 million, was excluding pension because that
we took out in the math on the good side. So the numbers that you see in the $30 million include the benefit of pension.
So the Pratt number was a little north of $20 million, about $25 million increase. Otis was another $10 million or $11
million increase, and then offset by slight decrease in UTAS and CCS was flat and corporate office was down slightly.
So that's the net math of $30 million.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And then quickly, it looked like F-35 engine deliveries were less than the first
quarter where I would have thought they'd be ramping. So can you just talk about what's going on there?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Some of it, George, was just simply the Q4 deliveries which got pushed into January. It drove up
the Q1 more than what the original schedule was. So I think it was a little bit of catch up in Q1 that you saw. Q2 is
more in line with what we expected, and I think you'll see some ramp up happening in the second half. But again, the
profile was not very different, it was just that Q1 was higher than originally we had expected because of just the move
from Q4 to Q1.
