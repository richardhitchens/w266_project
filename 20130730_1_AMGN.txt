My name is [ph] Marvin and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's second quarter 2013 financial
results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a
question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. [Operator instructions]
I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may begin.
Arvind K. Sood
Thank you, [ph] Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our second quarter conference
call. I believe through our prepared comments today you will consistently hear the message of the progress we are
making on our full-year objectives as well as steps we are taking to deliver long-term value to shareholders.
To discuss our quarterly performance and our full-year outlook, I'm joined by several members of our leadership team.
Our Chairman and CEO Bob Bradway will begin with a brief strategic overview. Our Chief Financial Officer, Jon
Peacock will the review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our guidance for the year.

Our head of commercial operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss product performances and trends followed by Sean
Harper, our ahead of R&D, who will provide a brief pipeline update. After Sean's comments, we should have ample
time for Q&A.
We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you
separately by email.
Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement which, in summary says, that through the course
of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary
materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert A. Bradway
Okay. Thanks Arvind. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter call.
As you can see from our results through the first half of the year, we are carrying good momentum into the third and
the fourth quarters and are on track to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth for the year as indicated by our
increased guidance.
Reflecting on our second quarter performance, I would highlight the growth of our two largest products Enbrel and
Neulasta, as well as the continued success we are experiencing in launching Prolia and XGEVA globally. While we are
on track to deliver for the year, we are making strong progress as well on our long-term growth objectives.
Our strategy for growth starts with innovation. So let me start first about our pipeline. As you may recall, we expect
eight of our pipeline programs to generate registration enabling data by 2016. We announced positive Phase III data
from the first two of these, T-VEC in malignant melanoma and trebananib in ovarian cancer in the second quarter and
Sean Harper will have more to say about each of these in a moment.
In the cardiovascular arena our innovative PCSK9 program, AMG145, is advancing well and we announced today that
we expect pivotal data for this program in the first quarter of 2014. This will obviously be a significant event for us
and, we hope, for cardiovascular patients as well.
In June, we announced a couple of business development initiatives in the cardiovascular area that are worth touching
on here. First, subject to the customary regulatory clearances, we plan to acquire the U.S. commercial rights to a novel
heart drug, ivabradine, developed by Servier and approved in the EU and a number of other markets for chronic heart
failure and stabile angina and Sean will talk about our plans for filing this drug with the FDA in his remarks.
As part of this transaction, we will partner our heart failure molecule, omecamtiv mecarbil, in the EU with Servier, and
then separately we have acquired rights to develop omecamtiv mecarbil in Japan. We see development and commercial
benefits to working with Servier in the heart failure area and expect that the benefits of engaging cardiologists in the
U.S. ahead of any launch of AMG145 will be attractive as well.
With respect to our international expansion efforts we announced important progress during the quarter. We are excited
about our collaboration in Japan with Astellas, through which we now have a clear path forward for our innovative
medicines in the world's second-largest market. We expect our collaboration with Astellas to result in a wholly-owned
Amgen affiliate as early as 2020.
Additionally we formed a joint venture in China with Zhejiang Beta Pharma to commercialize Vectibix which we
expect to be our first new product for China in the 2015 timeframe. These collaborations clearly augment our presence
in these large and growing markets and allow us to bring our medicines directly to patients who can benefit from them.
I can imagine there may be questions about our M&A strategy at the moment. So without talking about any specific
opportunities, I would like to highlight that our acquisition strategy continues to focus on assets that we think offer

attractive prospects for growth and return on capital in areas where we can add value for our shareholders through our
capabilities, infrastructure, and experience.
Our strategy is aimed at targets that are additive to the progress that we are making operationally, and with our own
pipeline. As we look at opportunities we will remain disciplined and committed to growing our dividend and
maintaining our solid investment grade credit rating.
Before turning it over to Jon to review our financial highlights I would like to acknowledge the contributions of my
Amgen colleagues who, once again this quarter, delivered for patients and shareholders. Jon?
Jonathan M. Peacock
Thanks, Bob.
So overall growth in total revenues of 5% for the quarter were supported by solid product sales growth of 9%. This was
driven, as Bob has mentioned, by strong performance across the portfolio, including Enbrel and Neulasta, our largest
products and continued progress with Prolia and XGEVA. It also included a positive adjustment of $185 million to
previous estimates for managed Medicaid rebates on prior period sales and this is based on recent claims experience.
These adjustments primarily affected the filgrastim and ESA franchises and overall they had an impact on EPS of
around $0.16.
Other revenues in the quarter were lower compared to 2012, reflecting the $200 million payment from Takeda that we
recognized in the second quarter of last year.
Operating expenses were up 8% driven by the increase in Phase III clinical activity, particularly related to our PCSK9
molecule, AMG145. And now that our Phase III trials are up and running and progressing well, you should expect that
R&D expenses in the remaining two quarters of the year will be broadly in line with the expenses that we have reported
for the second quarter.
SG&A expenses were 3% higher. Within this Enbrel profit share expenses were up 15% to $425 million. As you may
recall, one of the Enbrel royalty commitments expired during the first quarter, resulting in a higher increase in Enbrel
profits relative to the increase in sales compared to a year ago. Excluding the Enbrel profit share, SG&A costs were
slightly down versus a year ago.
Cost of sales margin excluding the Puerto Rico excise taxes were flat at 13.9% of product sales. Other income and
expenses were $145 million in the quarter. This is broadly representative of what you should expect for the remaining
two quarters of the year.
The tax rate on the quarter of 11.9% benefited from a different jurisdictional mix of costs and revenues, and the 2013
federal R&D credit. Overall, adjusted earnings per share increased 3% to $1.89.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 5, we generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion in the quarter. The
higher cash flow of $2.2 billion that you will see on the page in Q2 of last year was driven by two discrete items,
specifically the termination of interest rate swap agreements and a one-time payment received in Spain to settle several
older receivable balances last year.
In addition to our quarterly dividend this quarter, year-to-date we have repurchased shares for a total cost of $800
million, and at an average cost of $85 per share. We didn't repurchase additional shares during the second quarter.
At the end of the quarter we held $22 billion in cash or liquid investments and $23.9 billion in debt. And as Bob noted
earlier, we remain committed to increasing our dividend meaningfully over time and to our solid investment grade
ratings.
Turning to guidance for the full year on page 6, we now expect full year revenues to be at the upper end of our
guidance, of $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion, and we're raising our guidance on adjusted earnings per share to a range of

$7.30 to $7.45. Within this, we now expect our tax rate for the full year to be between 9% and 10%. And finally, our
guidance on capital expenditures remains unchanged at approximately $700 million.
Let me hand over to Tony now who will give you some more insight on product sales during the quarter.
Anthony C. Hooper
Thanks, Jon.
You will find a summary of our global performance for quarter 2 on slide number 7. As expected we had a strong
quarter 2 with product sales growing 9% year-over-year, and 11% quarter-over-quarter. We remain focused on
executing against our commercial strategy. Our underlying business excluding the impact of the Medicaid adjustment
delivered 5% year-over-year growth and 6% quarter-over-quarter.
We also saw sales growth from all of our regions, the US was up 4% and the rest of world was up 9% year-over-year or
12% excluding foreign exchange.
I would like to review our Q2 performance for our portfolio, starting with Enbrel. Enbrel continues to be recognized by
rheumatologists and dermatologists with its track record of efficacy, safety and long-term experience. We are submitted
to investing in Enbrel over the long term.
In quarter two, Enbrel's sales grew 9% year-over-year, primarily due to price. Quarter-over-quarter we saw increased
unit demand of 9%. Underlying market demand in both rheumatology and dermatology segments remains strong. In
rheumatology Enbrel continues to hold share, while in dermatology we saw a slight decrease in share due to increasing
competitive activity.
Our direct-to-consumer advertising continues to emphasize the benefits of using Enbrel. Enbrel consistently leads the
total brand awareness in the rheumatology segment. Additionally, physicians continue to honor over 90% of Enbrel
patient requests. With Enbrel we remain the value share leader in both rheumatology and dermatology segments and
are confident in the further growth potential.
Moving now to Neulasta and NEUPOGEN, as you know, Neulasta represents approximately 80% of this franchise. We
continue to emphasize first and every cycle treatment as the best way to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia in
appropriate patients. Year-over-year global sales of Neulasta increased by 10%. This was driven by price, wholesaler
inventory and the impact of Medicaid adjustment mentioned previously. Worldwide unit demand was down 3%
year-over-year but flat quarter-over-quarter.
In the U.S., we actually saw penetration levels increase in quarter 2. NEUPOGEN sales were down 2% year-over-year,
declines in unit demand in the U.S. and the rest of the world were partially offset by price and the impact from
Medicaid adjustment.
EPOGEN was up 15% quarter-over-quarter due to increased unit demand as a result of the peginesatide recall as well
as the impact of Medicaid adjustment. We continue to work with the dialysis clinics to ensure uninterrupted supply for
dialysis patients.
Aranesp global sales were up 12% quarter-over-quarter and were flat excluding the impact of the Medicaid adjustment.
In both the U.S. and Europe, demand appears to be trending slightly downward driven by dose reduction in the U.S.
and continued pressure from price cuts and competition in Europe.
Sensipar sales increased 12% year-over-year due to increases in overall unit demand driven by strong penetration.
Sensipar is an important product addressing a significant unmet medical need and we are confident that Sensipar will
remain a growth driver for Amgen.
Nplate and Vectibix sales in aggregate were higher year-over-year. For Nplate, market demand continues to grow in
both the U.S. and in Europe. For Vectibix we saw unit demand increases in both the U.S. and Europe. Over 50% of our

sales are in Europe and we continue to pursue reimbursement with payers across Europe in both first and second line
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer consistent with our label.
Denosumab delivered strong results in quarter 2. For Prolia, we saw the seasonal uptick that we have come to expect in
the second quarter. We expect the third quarter to emulate the seasonality seen last year too. We continue to grow share
in the U.S. and in Europe. In the U.S., since launching the new direct-to-consumer campaign with Blythe Danner visits
to Prolia.com are up more than fivefold. Average monthly patient requests have increased 25% and over 90% of Prolia
patient requests are honored by prescribers.
We are improving the repeat injection rates in the U.S. and our latest data shows 63% of patients returning for their
second injection. In Europe, we have recently finalized reimbursement negotiations in France, and we will be launching
soon.
XGEVA global sales grew 12% quarter-over-quarter. In the U.S. our value share grew by 2 percentage points in the
quarter. We now hold 61% share in the segment. Outside the U.S., XGEVA grew 33% quarter-over-quarter driven by
share gains. Recent launches in Europe continue this strong trajectory. In France we have already achieved 40%
segment value share since launching in quarter one. Our commercial focus is the superior clinic benefit of XGEVA for
the benefit of patients.
Moving now to inventory, for the U.S., I would note that our product portfolio ended quarter with wholesale inventory
within the normal range.
Lastly, let me comment on our business outside the U.S. We saw solid growth in Europe, 6% excluding the impact of
foreign exchange, driven by continued growth of both Prolia and XGEVA. We are also pleased with the contributions
from both our MN [Mustafa Nevzat] and Bergamo acquisitions in Turkey and Brazil.
Additionally, let me take a moment to announce the Servier partnership that Bob talked about which is subject to
normal regulatory approvals. To us, this is an important step as we build and expand our cardiovascular capabilities and
relationships for the future potential introduction of AMG145 and other cardiovascular drugs.
In summary, I'm very pleased with both the competitive strategies our team have developed and their focused execution
against these strategies. Our underlying business delivered a strong quarter, and I believe we are well positioned to
achieve our full year revenue growth objectives.
Let me pass you now on to Sean. Sean?
Sean E. Harper
Thanks, Tony.
It's been a good quarter for the R&D organization. Our pipeline continues to march forward. We recently presented the
results of our Phase III study of T-VEC in the setting of metastatic melanoma at ASCO. We've already engaged in
discussions with regulators based on this data set, which demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit and durable
response and a strong trend in overall survival. Keeping in mind that the trigger for analysis is event driven, our latest
estimate for the primary overall survival analysis is now the first half of 2014.
Beyond monotherapy in melanoma, we remain very excited about the potential for pursuing T-VEC in other tumor
types and in particular, as a priming agent with other cancer immunotherapies such as PD-1 antagonists, an enthusiasm
which is shared by other companies with whom we are building such collaborations.
As you know, in Q2, we released positive top-line data on the primary end point of progression free survival from the
Phase III study of trebananib, our peptide antagonist of the angiopoietin axis in recurrent ovarian carcinoma, the final
overall survival analysis, a secondary endpoint, is currently estimated to occur in the second half of 2014.

Turning to Vectibix, we're engaged in discussions with world-wide regulators on potential label changes based on
recent studies and analyses in first and third line metastatic colorectal cancer.
XGEVA received an additional indication in giant-cell tumor which addresses a serious unmet need in this rare
condition which affects pediatric and adult populations. Data from a key study was recently published in Lancet
Oncology.
Data from Phase II studies of brodalumab in psoriatic arthritis resulted in the decision in our collaboration with
AstraZeneca MedImmune to proceed into Phase III for this indication. In addition, within this collaboration, AMG139,
a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-23 also known as MEDI2070 has entered Phase II for Crohn's disease.
We terminated our small molecule inhibitor of the GlyT1 transporter AMG747 which was in Phase II for schizophrenia
due to unexpected severe skin reaction.
As we announced last quarter, we have initiated our biosimilar Herceptin pivotal study. Due to a delay in the
availability of biosimilar, trastuzumab, manufactured by a contract organization, enrollment in this study is being
suspended temporarily and will resume when continuous supply is ensured. We continue to expect to initiate launch of
our biosimilars portfolio in 2017.
Turning to our cardiovascular disease therapeutic area, the AMG145 Phase III program is proceeding nicely and we
expect the LDL cholesterol data from our four Phase III studies as monotherapy in combination with statins in statin
intolerant patients and in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in the first quarter of next year.
I also want to comment on how pleased I am that we anticipate gaining rights in the United States to ivabradine, a
novel ion channel antagonist, through a partnership with Servier. We feel this agent can bring unique value to heart
failure and stable angina patients with elevated heart rates despite treatment with available therapies and this will
increase our engagement with the cardiovascular community, an area of great focus for us. Servier has generated an
impressive amount of clinical outcomes data, including the recent outcome study in heart failure, supporting
registration in Europe and elsewhere and we look forward to working on U.S. registration with FDA.
Staying with cardiovascular programs, our Phase II study of intravenous omecamtiv mecarbil in acute heart failure that
we conducted in collaboration with Cytokinetics recently completed. These data will be presented at the European
Society of Cardiology meeting in September.
Finally, just to share with you some thoughts on our earlier stage efforts, around six months into it, we are finding our
scientific integration with deCODE Genetics to be even more productive and impactful than we had hoped. We now
have multiple cases in which advanced human genetic analyses have allowed us to establish programs against new
novel disease targets as well as to prioritize existing targets within our early and mid-stage pipeline.
As part of a future R&D review, I will look forward to elaborating with some examples. I'm more confident than ever
that this strategy of guiding our R&D efforts via this advanced human genetics will meaningfully improve our
productivity.
Bob.

Okay, thank you, Sean. And now we'll turn it over to Arvind and [ph] Marvin for the Question & Answer session.

[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Thank you for taking my question. I guess I will first start with the base business question,
since that progressed nicely this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the unit declines you are seeing with Neulasta
and is there any concern that that might be due to the upcoming NEUPOGEN launch by Teva or the
NEUPOGEN-similar product launch by Teva and also on the XGEVA side, what kind of trends are you seeing in the
face of generics? Has generics been able to take much share at all in this space? Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: This is Tony. Let me respond to a couple of those. One, we've looked deeply into the
Neulasta business and looked at the chemo regimens. We've seen nothing specific that's impacting the business at the
moment. I think it would be too early to be looking at any type of impact of a competitor to NEUPOGEN and just a
reminder, any other product that comes up, that would not be a biosimilar but would be a separate BLA.
Turning to XGEVA, it looks like there are about seven generics now competing for the Zometa business that has
declined quite dramatically. XGEVA has maintained about a 40% unit market share. There was a slight decline in new
bio-naïve patients in the first couple of months, and that seems to have picked back up again to where it was in the past.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Thanks. Just on this Medicaid accrual. I know you guys explained that you basically had
some claims experience that drove the decision, but could you maybe give a little bit more color, specifically what was
the sort of exogenous event or set of circumstances that led to taking it this quarter?
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yeah, Chris, it's Jon. We have been keeping track of the claims that we have been
receiving against the reserves that we set up over the last two to three years for Medicaid patients being processed
through the managed health care systems state by state across the U.S. We made a judgment that the claims that were
coming in consistently over that period, since we started the accrual were coming in somewhat lower than the reserves
that we'd set, and so it became clear that the net revenues were higher than we had estimated at the time we set up the
reserves. So the adjustment we're making is really to recognize that those net revenues are based on the actual claims
experience that we've seen over the last couple of years, the net revenues were higher than we had estimated when we
set up those reserves. So we were at a point where with our orders we felt it was appropriate to recognize that.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of the Matthew Roden with UBS securities.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually not an Onyx question, it's an Amgen
question but you know it seems like you do have an appetite to do a sizable deal if it makes sense. I was just wondering
if you could talk about your flexibility to finance a larger transaction like this. Can you talk maybe about how you view
your own balance sheet in terms of what debt ratios you are comfortable with, your ability to access offshore cash, your
appetite to include stock in a transaction? Again, this isn't necessarily with respect to the current process but in general,
just trying to understand your willingness and ability to go big if you feel that it's the right thing to do. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yeah, Matt, thanks for the question and perhaps Jon and I can both take pieces of what
you have asked. As I said in my remarks our M&A strategy is very much focused on assets that we think offer
attractive growth potential, assets that we think we can earn an attractive return on capital from for our shareholders
and we are very much focused on things that we think line up well with our capabilities, infrastructure and experience.
So that's the focus.

With respect to the financial size, Matt, I think we have tried to be pretty consistent and clear that we are – that first we
have a strong balance sheet, which is reflected in our solid investment grade rating and it's important to us to maintain
that strong balance sheet and the investment grade rating that we have. So that's clearly something we look at and think
about very carefully.
Our focus has been and is likely to continue to be, Matt, on transactions that we think we can finance with cash and,
you know, to the extent that the acquisitions are onshore, it would be onshore cash. To the extent that we find
opportunities internationally as we have from time to time been able to do, we use international cash for that purpose.
But, again, we are looking at transactions that we think enable us to grow, that are additive to what we're otherwise
doing with the business, that enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet and continue our track record of growing the
dividend for our shareholders.
Jon, I don't know whether you want to add any specific flavor on the debt ratings to Matt's question.
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: No, I'd just reiterate that we are committed to continuing to increase the dividend
meaningfully over time. We said and have continued to say since 2011 over the five-year period to 2015, we are
committed to returning, on average, more than 60% of net income to shareholders and I think we are well on track to
doing that as well. So I think, you know, those are all, you know, important – important commitments to us and, you
know, they all fit alongside our acquisition strategy.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: All right. Let's go to the next question, [ph] Marvin.
Operator
Our next questions come from the line of Eric – excuse me, Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: ...very simple one on the Astellas deal. Post 2020 buyouts, what proportion of the economics
does Astellas retain? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure. I'm not sure we heard the beginning of that question, Ravi, but Jon, go ahead and
take a crack at it.
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yeah, there are really two elements to the deal, Ravi, just to sort of explain how it
works. We have five pipeline assets around which we have arranged a profit share agreement with Astellas. They are
co-funding the department of those assets and we will also co-commercialize them, through which there is profit share
agreements over the life of each of those assets.
Alongside that we are working with Astellas to set up a joint venture and through that joint venture, we will build the
Amgen affiliate. We will take full ownership of that affiliate by 2020. There are no significant economics that pass
through that joint venture, so the only economics that flow to Astellas are through the profit share arrangements on
those five products.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks. I guess the question maybe for Jon on the tax rate. Could you talk a little bit about
this jurisdictional mix that drove down the guidance, and is that specific to 2013 or is that going to carry over into
future years?
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yeah, Eric, I won't get into too much detail about that except to say as our expense base
in R&D increases in support of our clinical trial activity, a lot of that expense base is U.S. based and a lot of that is fully
deductible and against the full U.S. taxes and that sort of is one of the mix issues that drive it.

Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Yeah, I guess just two quick questions. For PCSK9, you talked about when you will get
data. Should we expect you to file a couple of months after that or are there other studies that you will need to support a
filing?
And then on the $185 million Medicaid benefit, it looks like about $56 million or so is in the Aranesp line, could you
just quantify how much is any other products and EPOGEN versus the NEUPO- franchise? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yeah, why don't we split that into two parts? Jon, why don't you address the Medicaid
question first and then Sean can talk about PCSK9.
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yeah, I think, Rachel, of the $185 million, it's predominantly in the filgrastim and ESA
franchise, and as you noted from the comments Tony made on Aranesp it's about 50 in the Aranesp space, the rest is
largely spread across the other three. I don't want to get into much more detail on that. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: On PCSK9, Sean?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, I don't want to get into specifics of when we are going to file but these are the pivotal,
you know, data sets that we're thinking about submitting for initial registration.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Thanks very much for taking the question. A question for Tony. Tony, could you talk a little
bit about the Enbrel and Neulasta franchises which are pretty dominant right now and give us a sense of what
proportion of business for those two products is now contracted with payers or other entities and potentially subject to
rebates and price negotiations?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Geoff, I'm not sure what the question is around contract. We have access and
reimbursement across all channels for Enbrel and for Neulasta. And there are specific rebates that are built into some of
these, but that's about as much as we have disclosed to date. Am I missing a piece of your question?
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Geoff, are you there? I think we lost Geoff. [ph] Marvin, let's go on to the next question and
maybe Geoff can get back in the queue.

Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.
<Q>: ...question. This is actually [ph] Chris Freeroan (32:11). I have a question about the Epo franchise. Now that you
no longer have a competitor in this space, can you comment on how you're thinking about the franchise in the second
half of 2013 and as you head into 2014?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure, Chris, we can take that. I will ask Tony to address it.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So the way we look at it at the moment is pretty much the way we have for about 20 years
or so, that we have looked to bring the highest value to patients, to make sure all the patients who are available get
access to Epo, and then we continue to build the strong record we have around both the efficacy and the safety profile
of this drug for the future when someone else tries to enter the market.

<A - Robert A. Bradway>: [ph] Chris, the other thing that's perhaps worth just commenting on is obviously CMS has
proposed cuts in the reimbursement rate to dialysis providers and we're in the comment period with CMS and
obviously we and the providers will work to make sure that CMS understands the risks that the cuts, if implemented,
might have on patients having access to appropriate quality care. So it's still early days. We won't know for some
number of months what the likely impact of that proposed cut is going to be. But that's the other thing that we are
working with the providers on when it comes to the EPOGEN prospects.
Let's go to the next question, [ph] Marvin.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Thanks for letting me jump back in, Arvind. I just want to clarify, Tony. On the case of
Enbrel, we are hearing a lot that you are in preferred position with payers in quite a number of situations. I'm just
wondering how much of your Enbrel business, you know, is driven in that way as opposed to more or less open
formularies. Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: I think we vacillate between one of two or one of three in most of the situations that we
have, Geoff.
<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Okay, [ph] Marvin, let's take the next question please.

Our next question comes from Howard Liang with Leerink Swann.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. Was there a specific reason why there was no share repurchase in the
second quarter, and how would an acquisition the size of Onyx impact the share repurchase program?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Obviously we'll avoid talking about the specifics related to Onyx. But, Jon, if you want to
talk about the quarter that we just completed.
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yeah, I think we said at the beginning of the year that the share repurchases for this year
and into next year would be more modest. We had a fairly heavy share repurchase program at the beginning of the year
as, you know, we saw the stock price hovering around $80 a share. We've got about $1.6 billion remaining on the share
repurchase program that we have said we expect will last us into – well into 2014. So, you know, this isn't a sort of
smooth quarter-by-quarter process. We'll gauge it appropriately.
And then, you know, in terms of acquisitions, I would just sort of restate that, you know, we are committed to the
capital allocation commitments that I highlighted earlier on.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Just perhaps a little bit of additional color, Howard. As you know during the quarter we
had a couple of big clinical events, we had a couple of important business development transactions that I have already
addressed. So it is not unusual for us when we have that much activity to be out of the share buyback market.

then you guys said earlier that, you know, that you thought outcomes data would ultimately be the key driver for
adoption of this class. I was just curious if you have any updated views on that.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, I mean, I think that we had a very robust Phase II program for this molecule, given how
enthusiastic we are about the pathway and the opportunity to really help, you know, patients with cardiovascular
disease. So I suppose that what I'm anticipating from the Phase III studies is going to reflect very closely what we saw
in Phase II, the populations we are studying are the same, the drug dosages and approaches are the same, and I would
hope we continue to see quite a significant, you know, 50% to 70% kind of reduction in LDL cholesterol, whether it's
used in monotherapy or on the back of existing statin therapies, and I'd hope to see, you know, a continued similar
well-tolerated profile.
I think that the outcomes data will be important despite the tremendous amount of human genetic validation that exists
for the pathway and the view by virtually every expert that I have interacted with, that the outcomes data is kind of a
predictable positive result. I still need the data and the data will be important when they come. I think in the meantime,
for patients with particularly high risk and elevated LDL cholesterol, this will be an important intervention.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Oh, hi, thanks. You know, investors consistently say that biosimilar risk or at least branded
me-too products seem to be part of the overarching issue for thinking about Amgen over the next one to three years and
it's sort of reflected in the PE multiples, so maybe you could comment as to why products that are possibly coming this
year or in the future would not take a lot of market share and why you think that would be or would not be similar to
the experience in Europe? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. A couple of questions there, Mike. Tony, why don't you address...
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay. So let me just talk a little bit about it. I think the market has clearly understood that
these are not the generics coming, these are biosimilars. And when you look at what's happened in Europe, one realizes
that we've spent 20 years building a very good history around both the efficacy of these drugs and the long-term safety
data around these drugs.
In addition, and probably as important, that over that 20-year period, we are one of the few companies who have
continued to supply high quality product without exception. We have not at any stage shorted a patient. So as we have
used this as a set of high hurdles in Europe to run our business, this will be the same set of hurdles that will be applied
and we'll be using in the U.S. when potential competition comes to market. And that's why we at the moment are doing
the extrapolations and projections that we have.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. I'd just like to know, please, what you paid for Onyx. Just kidding.
Can I ask maybe a question of Sean Harper. I've asked this in prior calls, but it's just something I'm really interested in.
Maybe the cardiovascular drug in your pipeline, that doesn't get as much attention is omecamtiv. I think there's
important Phase II data coming up. Sean, I would love it if you could kind of walk us through the – sort of the – at least
in blueprint fashion, the design of the trials we are going to see data for and what the expectations maybe should be on
the Street? I mean, what exactly do you need to see to move into Phase III? And I know in the past, you've
characterized this as a high-risk program. I'd be wondering if – I just wonder if your view on that has evolved at all?
Thank you very much.

<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Fair enough.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: I think that just comes with operating in the heart failure space. I don't think it's anything about
this mechanism that makes it that. It's just, as we all know, while there are a number of therapies that have very clear
proven mortality benefit in this disease, there are quite a few that have turned out to have deleterious effects and so on,
so it's a difficult area to work in. Requires an upfront morbidity-mortality outcomes type of trial before one can gain
registration in most jurisdictions. But because of that, it requires a lot of investment. And, until you see those outcomes
data, you are not going to be absolutely sure of what you've got.
That said, if you look in this space right now and we validated this very much with our colleagues at Servier, you know
when you look in this space, there's virtually nothing out there in systolic heart failure that's really interesting as a
chronic treatment.
In that context, if you think about the experiments that we are doing, we are really – they really fall into two groups.
One is intravenous studies which are done very short term in hospitalized patients, and this is much more of a PK/PD
kind of a study to try to understand in that laboratory type of environment in which you can use intravenous drug,
measure concentrations in patients, monitor them real time over a 48 to 72 hour period, we can learn a lot about the
safety and the concentration exposure range we need to get activity. And in that context, that experiment is the one
which is three different cohorts with increasing levels of exposure that you will be seeing at the European meetings.
But a very important study is going now, which is an oral study that chronically doses patients over several months and
this is where the real potential value of this kind of therapy is. It's really about keeping these patients from having six to
ten hospitalizations per year for flares, making them more functional and, of course, possibly increasing their actual
outcome in terms of survival. And I think that we will have to see data from those chronic studies with the oral
presentation of the drug before we could understand that we have something that's worthy of going into a large
morbidity, mortality trial and pursuing that goal.
And, you know, I think this remains, as you appreciate, a program that's really of great interest given the epidemiology
of heart failure which around the world is rising and is really a true public health threat around the world.

Our next question comes from the line of Terrance Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Thank you for taking the questions. First on AMG145, I was just wondering if you can
comment about any IP that you or others might have with respect to the target itself?
And then the second question I had was just if you could -- I missed the comments on the biosimilar Herceptin product,
the delay. I thought you said it was due to a delay at a contract manufacturer but I guess I was under the impression that
you would be manufacturing this yourselves. Could you just clarify that for me? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure, Terrance, this is Bob. Let me take those questions. First, with respect to IP on 145,
as you know, we don't comment at this early stage often about IPs. So what I would offer is that we don't see any
barriers for us in developing and commercializing AMG145 and as you know, as you've heard us say repeatedly, we
are very excited about this access and what we think it can do for patients.
With respect to the comments on the biosimilar molecule and the process of transitioning this molecule that we,
perhaps you recall, licensed in, we are relying on a contract manufacturer to supply clinical material and some of that
clinical material hasn't been at the high quality standards that we require and so we are facing a little bit of a delay there
but as Sean pointed out, we don't expect any delays to our ultimately launching our first biosimilar molecules in 2017.

Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.
<Q>: Hi, good afternoon, it is [ph] Matthew (45:08) actually on for Ian. I wanted to go back to the conversation around
biosimilar, or biogeneric, branded generic NEUPOGEN and Neulasta and see if you wouldn't mind being a little more
specific on the steps or the actions you are taking to prepare the market or customers or payers in order to defend the
business in advance or protect the business in advance of the sort of fourth quarter November timing when the
injunction with Teva lifts. Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, thanks, [ph] Matthew. Tony, why don't you take a shot?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So first of all, we don't believe that there's any such thing as a biogeneric. It is either a
generic or it's a biosimilar and the biosimilars are pretty different to the generics. A lot of potential future competition
will be BLAs so they will have to be establishing themselves as separately independent new entities with no history
around efficacy and safety in the marketplace.
We've had seven plus years of experience in Europe, understanding a multitude of players that have come to market.
We are using all of the experience, all of this knowledge as we prepare for potential competition in the U.S.
Fundamentally, I'm not going to go into details around what we are doing in the U.S. but we have been relatively
successful outside the U.S., and we will be applying the same type of tactics. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.
<Q - Eun K. Yang>: Thanks very much, a question on AMG145. In the second part of TESLA study in the
homozygous patients, are you testing for LDL receptor functionality to selected patients where there is some residual
activity, receptor activity, but not the -- not those with the negative activity?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: You know, we're – it's difficult to make those predictions, Eun. So I think that as we see, you
know, responses to the therapy in individuals, it will be then much easier to ask those kind of biochemical questions
about, you know, why and, of course, if you see a response to therapy, you are going to know that to some extent,
there's some kind of functional LDL receptor being expressed on the surface of the [indiscernible] (47:35) and you can
begin to work out some of that. But right now it's not a case where we are doing all of that kind of biochemical analysis
up front and choosing patients to treat, but kind of the other way around.

Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Thanks a lot. I had a question about the revenue guidance. Because certainly if you look at what
you delivered this quarter, and match that up with the guidance, it suggests flat or maybe even slightly down, I wonder
why you didn't increase the guidance more? Thanks.
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: I think if you adjust for the one-time events that we've seen year-to-date, you will see a
different trend. So to bear in mind the adjustment we made in the first quarter on the Enbrel returns and the adjustment
we have made this quarter on the Medicaid rebates which are adjusting revenues from prior periods. I think if you take
that out, you will see that we are expecting to carry some good momentum into the second half of the year.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: So [ph] Marvin, I think we have covered a lot of topics here and most if not all of the major
analysts have had a chance to ask questions. Why don't we take two last questions?

to have some step edits. Do you actually today engage in discussions with those payers about that upcoming potential
product in the market? And if you haven't, when would you, assuming that you would do it well before you actually
filed a program? Thank you.

Our last question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: I appreciate the follow-up. It's a bigger picture R&D question for Bob. I think, a couple years
ago, either you or your predecessor had talked about trying to target 18% to 20% of sales or revenue being reinvested in
R&D and you run a tad higher than that in the first half of the year. Is that still a longer term goal, that 18% to 20%?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Well, you are right to notice it's running a tad higher and that's one of the reasons why Jon
tried to provide some clarity for you in his remarks. Obviously, you can deduce from our comments about 145 that we
are excited about that program, and doing everything we can to deliver the results that we have talked about for the first
quarter of next year and so an important part of what we're spending money on now are these late stage Phase III
programs. So, you know, we are not far off the guidance we gave you but we wanted to be clear and that's we
addressed it in our prepared remarks today.

Thanks Bob and the rest of the team. I would like to thank you, all of the analysts and shareholders who participated in
