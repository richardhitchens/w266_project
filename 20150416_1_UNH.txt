I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley.
Please go ahead.
Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. This morning we are going to continue in our efforts to keep our
formal remarks brief, allowing more time to respond to questions. We're also going to freshen things up a little and
share portions of today's formal commentary between Dave Wichmann, our President; and Larry Renfro, our Vice
Chairman. I'll start out with a recap of the quarter.
Net earnings in the quarter grew 33% to $1.46 per share on revenues of $35.8 billion. What is important is what lies
inside these results: higher revenue growth, more consistent performance and operating discipline, and margin strength
across UnitedHealth Group's broad strategically diversified set of businesses. Operating cash flows were $2.3 billion
for the quarter, 1.6 times net income. Revenue and earnings performance from UnitedHealthcare were the biggest
contributors to better-than-expected first quarter cash flows.
This quarter builds on the second half 2014 momentum we discussed with you before. We expect that momentum to
continue, with second quarter earnings per share growing nicely from this past quarter's results and being modestly
above current consensus estimates. At this range, we see second quarter and third quarter earnings being more even,
stronger in the second quarter and lighter in the third quarter than current consensus would suggest. This pattern would
better fit our current business trends and outlook.
We are advancing our 2015 full year outlook, taking revenues to $143 billion, a $2 billion increase and a nearly 10%
year-over-year growth pace. Net per share earnings advanced to a new tighter range of $6.15 to $6.30 per share, an
11% year-over-year gain at the upper end, despite absorbing $0.10 per share attributed to Catamaran transaction cost
and the impact of reducing our level of share repurchase going forward. The increase in revenue and earnings modestly
improves our outlook for cash flow from operations by $200 million on the lower end of a new range of $8.2 billion to
$8.4 billion.
Now I'll ask Larry to review Optum, then ask Dave to pick up with UnitedHealthcare and some UnitedHealth Group
enterprise items. Larry?
Larry C. Renfro
Thanks, Steve. Optum's revenues grew 14.7% to $12.8 billion in the quarter, with operating margin stable
year-over-year at 5.8% despite more than 30 basis points of acquisition costs. Optum's earnings from operations grew
14% to $742 million in the quarter, with every reporting unit producing double-digit percentage earnings growth.
Catamaran acquisition costs reduced Optum's year-over-year earnings growth by 7 percentage points in the quarter.
Setting aside these transaction costs, Optum would have produced 21% earnings growth for the quarter. We expect
Optum to post strong earnings growth in 2015. And after fully absorbing Catamaran acquisition costs, we continue to
forecast operating earnings within the range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion. This will be growth of at least 50% over
two years from a base of less than $2.5 billion in 2013.
We continue to build our capabilities in important ways this quarter, particularly our relationships starting with
Catamaran. The proposed Catamaran combination brings obvious benefits to the markets and customers we serve. It
will create a competitively scaled channel-agnostic PBM focused on growing and serving all prescription market
segments. It will advance the next generation synchronized PBM where all clinical data points are connected and drug
considerations are fully integrated with clinical care processes to produce better outcomes and better overall cost
trends. This will be important as the age of specialty pharma emerges along with their inevitable biosimilar
counterparts.

People will be served better. Benefit and program sponsors will benefit from both the more progressive synchronized
care offering as well as from sharing the meaningful savings achieved from combining these two enterprises.
Integration disruption can be avoided since the two companies already share a common technology. We believe this
can quickly become the next generation clinically-informed, clinically-anchored PBM.
Looking forward, our Optum team is driving meaningful growth in customer pipeline for all Optum business segments.
Optum's external revenue backlog grew 24% in the quarter to drive overall backlog to over $9 billion.
Optum continues to develop broader relationships with more sophisticated clients who need end to end solutions to the
complex challenges they face. For example, Optum360 has added sizable and distinguished new partners, most notably,
North Shore-LIJ Health System and the Mayo Clinic. And in the UK, Optum International became one of the very few
organizations to be accredited to serve under the NHS Lead Provider Framework as the NHS procures an expected $1
billion of commissioning support annually. Optum Labs recently added Yale University as a partner and research from
the lab has now been accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Medical Association and the British
Medical Journal.
Finally, this quarter we launched an important new brand campaign for Optum to help further build understanding of
our services and innovation.
Now let me turn it over to Dave.
David Scott Wichmann
Thank you, Larry. Turning first to UnitedHealthcare, first quarter revenues grew 11.5% to $32.6 billion and its
operating margin improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 5.8%, reflecting strong performance in all businesses:
commercial, Medicaid, Medicare and global. Each of the first quarter care ratios improved year-over-year and were
better than our plans for the quarter. The combination of strong growth across a well-diversified benefits business, and
even more effective medical and operating cost performance produced a 35% increase in UnitedHealthcare's quarterly
earnings from operations to $1.9 billion.
The headline for UnitedHealthcare in the quarter is growth, growing organically to serve 1 million more people in the
United States in the first quarter alone and 1.6 million more people year-over-year, with notable strength this quarter in
the seniors and commercial businesses. We are increasing our projections for organic growth in domestic medical
benefits by about 600,000 people from our investor conference outlook to approximately 1.4 million people in 2015.
The increased outlook is driven by stronger market response to our expanding commercial benefits product portfolio.
In the first quarter, UnitedHealthcare's commercial business grew nicely, serving 680,000 more people. Growth
included 570,000 public exchange consumers, well ahead of our expectations. In our earnings outlook, and as we have
said before, we do not expect meaningful financial contributions from these customers in 2015. On the international
side, UnitedHealthcare is underwriting and pricing to create both sustainable customer value and sustainable margins
and is scaling to deliver results.
Amil, our Brazilian healthcare company, produced improved financial results on a better mix of business, with
revenues growing 12% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Medicaid membership exceeded plan, even with the
expected decreases in Tennessee where the state introduced a third plan into the market.
UnitedHealthcare grew its Medicare businesses in the first quarter by another 380,000 people, split pretty evenly
between Medicare Advantage and supplemental benefits.
Two weeks ago, CMS issued its final Medicare Advantage rate notice for 2016. While these rates will help provide
some needed stability for seniors who continue to enroll in Medicare Advantage in record numbers, the rates simply did
not keep up with the pace of medical cost increases. We will continue to make the case on behalf of the millions of
seniors we serve for sound and stable approaches to Medicare Advantage funding in the future.

Before we sum up, let me run through a short punch list of non-financial highlights for the quarter for UnitedHealth
Group as a whole. During the quarter, we invested in brands and reputation broadly across UnitedHealth Group
including the brand campaign Larry mentioned for Optum and the successful introduction of UnitedHealthcare's own
fresh branding effort. Both have generated favorable responses and we will build on these throughout the year.
We are getting scaled market traction on several innovation efforts. Rally, our digital consumer health platform, now
reaches nearly 9 million Americans across a broad spectrum of employers, health plans and associations and is
improving consumer engagement. We plan to expand to nearly 30 million people by this time next year, including
consumers in Brazil.
Link, the secured cloud-based workspace for care providers now reaches nearly 425,000 care providers and expects to
reach 600,000 care providers or more by this time next year. We continue to advance higher quality, lower cost care
with our delivery system partners on behalf of those we serve. Medical spending under value-based arrangements grew
nearly 30% year-over-year to a nearly $40 billion annual run rate.
This was an active quarter in terms of acquisition and capital deployment. We will fund these efforts from internal
resources and debt and we have maintained our credit ratings.
And lastly, the United Health Foundation continues to engage in a focused manner with communities in need. As
examples, the Foundation recently announced substantial support for an innovative community care program in
Maricopa County, Arizona, pioneering medical education and services in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and a
technology initiative in Tennessee that connects patients with care professionals through community health centers via
telemedicine. And OptumRx has crossed the $10 million milestone in prescription drugs donated to community health
clinics in Kansas.
Steve?
Stephen J. Hemsley
Thanks, Dave. So as we look forward I hope you sense an acceleration on a broad and disciplined set of initiatives –
sorry I didn't have my microphone on – so as we look forward, I hope you sense an acceleration on a broad and
disciplined set of initiatives in our consumer capabilities, brand and reputation for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum,
payment reform and progressive services to better support care providers, innovation in its more meaningful, larger
scale market deployment, strategic M&A, large far-reaching next-generation strategic relationships, information-driven
research, and social and philanthropic efforts aligned to the communities we serve.
On all these fronts and more, we intend to pick up our pace with thoughtful urgency and improve performance and
consistency, so as we grow, we become a more effective enabler of a better healthcare system and serve more people
with better outcomes through the prudent use of society's healthcare resources.
And now to recap, our 2015 outlook for $143 billion in revenues accelerates our revenue growth rate to nearly 10% this
year, with improvements coming from both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Our earnings outlook of $6.15 to $6.30 per
share includes $0.03 per share of transaction costs this quarter from Catamaran, and an additional $0.07 per share of
pressure over the balance of the year, principally due to repurchasing less than half the UnitedHealthcare Group shares
we had targeted before this combination.
For 2016, we continue to project core earnings growth and that the Catamaran combination will be $0.30 per share
accretive to those earnings, even while carrying $0.20 per share in amortization expenses.
Savings and accretion are expected to grow further in 2017 and 2018, improving value for customers and earnings
visibility for shareholders for a multiyear period. Today, we continue to have strong access to capital in both the equity
and debt markets. We believe we can continue to participate positively and fully as both the health benefits and health
service markets continue to evolve both domestically and internationally. And we remain focused on developing and
expanding our capabilities and businesses, both for UnitedHealthcare and Optum, as market opportunities present

have discussed this area of capital allocation with you previously, no changes are contemplated in that respect.
With that, I thank you, and we will now open up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We ask you limit yourself to one question per person so we can get to as many participants as
possible. And we can take our first question from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Thanks. Good morning. Just interested if you could give us some perspectives on what you're
seeing in terms of PMPM healthcare utilization in the quarter. Would seem with MLRs improving across the segments
that it remains well-controlled, but it's clear there's been some conflicting data points out there, showing that there
maybe has been some broader market increases to utilization, HCA pre-announcing yesterday, for example, with strong
admission volumes. So just interested in your perspectives on what you're seeing with utilization and how to sync
across some of those different data points we're seeing.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure, Scott. I think Dan Schumacher can best respond to that.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Good morning, Scott. Thanks for the question. I guess I wouldn't comment specifically
on PMPMs, but I would say that in the quarter we were very pleased with our medical cost performance. As we talked
about at the investor conference, as we formulated our forward trend outlook and we thought about how we priced and
positioned our benefits for 2015, we assumed that – we thought it made sense to assume a moderate increase in
underlying utilization. And I'll tell you in the first quarter, there has not been any acceleration in underlying utilization.
I think we've done well as an organization through our focused medical cost management initiatives and also I think
we're seeing benefits from greater consumer responsibility, as well as we continue to drive greater concentrations, as
Dave mentioned, in the value-based reimbursements. So as we look at the balance of the year, we expect our full year
commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points, and I would orient you towards
the lower half of that range.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And I think we have pretty good visibility on that, we have daily census. So I think maybe
some of the things that are coming forward might have something to do with the fact that 18 more million people have
coverage and are using the system in a more structured way in the past, and I think that may be a factor in what you're
seeing, Scott. Next question, please?
Operator
And we can take the next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Baker>: Yeah, thanks a lot. Given the pending purchase of Catamaran, was wondering if you could
give us a better sense or more color around your approach to differentiate on specialty pharmacy management, and then
any willingness by the PBM consultant community to change their approach to scoring vendors, given the change from
pharmacy benefit management to drug benefit management.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I think that's a great question, and I'll have Larry pick it up. But particularly the
strength of OptumRx's synchronization efforts to really be able to connect data, target individuals, engage them,
particularly as specialty pharma emerges, it really is a tremendous opportunity for us to distinguish ourselves. And the
cost of that category is such that it would be hard for us to believe that the customer community as well as the
consultant community will not be sensitized to that category of cost. Larry?

<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Hi, Mike. It's Larry Renfro. I'm going to start and I'm going to turn it over to Tim Wicks, who
is currently the CEO of OptumRx, soon to be the President of the new OptumRx. And I'll have him comment on
specialty. But maybe I could start by giving you a little bit of our thought process as we put the two companies
together. We really looked at where the value was going to be, and we really had five categories.
Number one would be scale. Number two would be enhanced technology. Three would be distinctive capabilities such
as specialty and synchronization, and we'll comment on specialty, as you asked. Number four would be our – we end
up with a well-rounded management team from both a, what I'll call, relationship sales as well as operations, customer
service and then the complementary businesses that kind of line up altogether. So that's kind of how we went at this.
Obviously, specialty is a very, very important aspect of going forward in the future as we talked about earlier in the
script. So I'm going to hand this off to Tim now and he'll give you some thoughts.
<A - Timothy A. Wicks>: Great. Thank you. Thank you, Larry. Michael, first of all, we welcome scoring related to
drug costs as opposed to simply straight up pharmacy discount rates. And what differentiates us in the specialty
pharmacy area and why we're competitive, first of all, it relates to trend management and the work that we do around
trend management and it really gets to all of the levers around synchronization in what we do to integrate medical,
clinical and lab data with pharmacy data, and to be able to bring that to bear to surround the consumer with all of those
capabilities that help them make better decisions, help them be adherent to their drug regimen and to be able to engage
in programs that will help them improve their health.
We also think that the approach that we take to site of care and being agnostic as to whether the specialty drug is
managed in the medical benefit or the pharmacy benefit is very important, and then we also take advantage of site of
care management so that we're agnostic to that as well and we drive it to the best place of care for the consumer.
<Q - Michael J. Baker>: Thanks for the update.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - David H. Windley>: Hi. Maybe a follow-up on the Catamaran thought process. So Larry, your 8% margin goal
for next year, there's – I think you and John have talked about there may be some variance in how you progress toward
that goal depending on the mix of business, obviously Catamaran brings in a pretty significant shift in the mix of that
business. Could you talk about how that affects your thoughts and your trajectory toward that 8% margin goal?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. That's a good point. I'm going to ask John to speak to this as well. We had this goal of
8% by 2016 and there were some various factors or components that we needed to really make as part of that overall
goal. First thing was and what you're commenting on is the 8% by 2016. We also said we would double 2013 earnings
of $2.5 billion by 2018. We said we would have 8 to 10 large more complex relationships and that we would have
double-digit top and bottom line growth through 2016.
So I'm going to define that as kind of our core business on kind of pre-Catamaran. And I would tell you that everything
from a financial standpoint is in line or ahead of expectations. So we're going to continue to track our core business that
way as far as the 8% by 2016 goal that we set. Now, as you know, the blend has changed with what we've done in this
transaction. So we're going to be handling a lot more pharmaceutical business, so that's going to change the mix and I'm
going to let John talk about that.
<A - John Rex>: David, this is John. So, as Larry stated, our 2015 performance to date would shows us solidly
tracking to the 8% by 2016 goal and we are very much committed to that 8% by 2016 goal that we put up as we think
about our base businesses and how that configures. When we plan as an organization, we plan for organic growth, and
that is how we got to configure our objectives and how we point the organization.

So clearly, that 8% by 2016 is very much focused on our core businesses organic growth. We are tracking to that and
we are still completely committed to that. Certainly, your point is well taken, adding an excess of $20 billion of
pharmacy care services revenue changes the mix. And I would expect that to change the mix as we think about kind of
2016 and where that lands. But we as an organization [ph] today (24:31) are completely committed to the 8% by 2016
on the core businesses and that's where we'd be tracking on the core base ex the impact of the additional pharmacy care
services revenue.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And then the merger will dilute that down but you will stay on track for your core
commitments on the core business [indiscernible] (24:49)
<A>: Right.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So thanks for that question. Next one, please?
Operator
Our next question will come from Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sarah James>: Thank you. I was impressed with the guidance boost, particularly after absorbing the Catamaran
cost, and I think it's the first time United's boosted guidance this early in the year since 2012. Can you talk about the
level of confidence you have heading into the year, if it's maybe greater or there's less unknowns than the last few years
that led you to an earlier guidance boost? And any headwinds or tailwinds that you could spike out for us would be
helpful. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, I am somewhat confused. I don't think we're doing anything differently in terms of
this. We, I think, kind of update our outlook every quarter. We have seen enough strength and growth in the businesses
across the board to improve that guidance slightly and have absorbed the costs associated with Catamaran and the
adjustment to our share repurchase given that transaction. So we thought that that was appropriate to include in the
update. And beyond that, I don't think we are changing anything else along those lines.
Typically, if we see that consensus estimates don't necessarily line up exactly with the way we are seeing our
quarter-by-quarter rollout, we typically comment on that and have again done that this quarter. So I don't think we've
done anything differently this quarter along those lines. So, and if we did, if you're picking up anything, we didn't
intend anything beyond what we said. So can you help me with what you think has changed?
<Q - Sarah James>: I just thought the EPS increase was bigger this year than first quarter of the last few years, but
maybe if you could just spike out the headwinds and tailwinds as you see them for 2015?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Well, I think that in terms of our business, I think our outlook is actually pretty
positive. I think that we are seeing growth across our businesses. I think we had nice momentum as we came out of
2014 and have kind of carried that into 2015. When we take a look at the strength of the businesses, I think our
Medicare offerings are stronger this year and we've had, I think, what we expected to be in terms of first quarter growth
there. The Medicaid business continues to be very strong, maybe a little stronger than what we had thought in the
beginning. We knew we were going to lose a portion of the State of Tennessee but our other growth kind of pulled that
to virtually even. Strong growth in the commercial business.
So we have had nice growth across UnitedHealthcare and we've had continued strong growth across Optum. Amil is
showing some initial signs of strengthening and recovering. They've done a nice job down there. And they have really
done, I think, an exceptional job of embracing some of the best breed of what both organizations do. So along those
lines, I think we have mostly positives. We continue to – we had hoped for stronger MA rates and funding. I think that
will be a consistent theme. We continue to work on improving our business and our business disciplines, but I do think
we're making very good progress on medical cost management, operating cost.
So across the board as I go through the inventory, I think we are probably in a stronger place than we have been in
some time, and the first quarter results pulled that through. So we have updated an outlook and I wouldn't suggest it's

anything more than that. Thank you. Next question.

And our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andy Schenker>: Thanks. Good morning. So you clearly saw good success in exchange enrollment beyond your
initial expectations. Maybe you could just discuss the factors around pricing and product design in your minds that led
to the enrollment success. And also maybe any early reads on those exchange lives versus your expectations. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. It's still early but I'll have Jeff Alter maybe comment on that. Thanks.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning, Andy. It's Jeff Alter. So as we kind of took you through our plans starting back in
2013 of how we were going to view the exchanges, and look at 2014 as the year of learning and then build kind of
quickly, rapidly as the market developed. I think the results that we saw in our initial enrollment year of 2015 were a
result of kind of that longer term strategic plan and, as we mentioned during our investor conference, really looked hard
at how people bought, what they were buying, what was successful in designed product and networks that could create
price points that were sustainable over the long term.
And I think as you look at where we got our membership, it would tie very nicely to where we said we thought we
would get on membership, and maybe we just got slightly more in those markets. So I think it was a result of sort of a
long-term strategic plan around this emerging market and the results of a lot of hard work to create the product and the
networks that could support price points that people were looking to buy at.
So that's something that drove the first quarter. I'd also say that what also drove our first quarter results were stronger
performance in our key account [ph] block (30:58), particularly around persistency or retaining existing clients. As we
went through our fourth quarter and into our first quarter, we retained more clients than we had in the past. And then
we've also expanded our product portfolio around some of the work that we did for exchanges, we also did stretch that
into newer low-priced product offerings for our small business, and some of our 51-99 employees business, and we saw
those results begin to emerge in the fourth quarter of 2014, and strengthen into 2015.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So I think a balanced performance overall and in the exchange, right products in the right
markets pretty much as we expected. And we knew back in January that the market was responding positively, so it's
played out nicely. Next question, please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Thanks. Good morning, I appreciate the call. Could you guys talk a little bit about the $0.20
of guidance boost, sort of exclude the $0.10 of cost that you guys are absorbing, but the $0.20 of core earnings, and
what the drivers are of that increase. How much of that is the benefits business versus Optum? And I guess within that,
how much of that is commercial versus government? And I guess further within that, how much of that is MLR related
and what you guys are seeing [ph] in other segments. (32:25)
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Dave, do you want to...
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Hey, Josh. It's Dave. Thank you for the question and it's a very good one. So we've
increased our guidance by 10% on average and then we're including an additional $0.10 of cost associated with the
transaction with Catamaran, and then also the impact of reduced share purchase. I'd say the number one contributor to
our performance improvement expectations here is growth. And I think it shows through pretty strongly across all of
the benefits businesses, with a particular emphasis on the overperformance in commercial.

What you probably don't see in that is – you see the lives on the insurance exchange but what you probably don't see is
the overperformance on the op exchange business which has been very strong as well. Jeff and his team have done a
very nice job there. So I kind of edge that more towards commercial.
And then in terms of other profit contributors would be our performance on MLR. And we expected to improve our
MLR during this year as we set forth both in the investor conference as well as on the fourth quarter call. But we have
clearly outperformed that this year as well. And I'd say that that's due to the strength of the performance on several
fronts. Our clinical engagement strategies and our ability to manage medical costs, the trend components that Dan
referred to earlier as well with respect to how we're performing on in-patient management overall is a – I think was a
key factor as well.
And then you can also see in Larry's prepared remarks that Optum expects to overperform as well, absorbing the costs
of the Catamaran transaction and still hitting the expected range of performance that they had laid out in the conference
as well as in the fourth quarter call.
So I think overall, you're seeing a strong performance and it's coming from multiple different fronts supporting the 20%
– the $0.20 improvement in our overall guidance.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Is it fair to say then, Dave, maybe two-thirds of the improvement is the benefits business and
then a third is Optum?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Yeah, I'd say that sounds fair. You know, plus or minus, overall. But yeah, I think
that's fair.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Two-thirds, [ph] 64 yeah, (34:56) – we couldn't calibrate it. But what's great is it is
balanced and I think that's the strength of kind of the diversified model. But – so all the businesses are contributing to
that advance and if we continue to execute appropriately, we're hoping to do better. So next question, please?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Good morning. Congratulations to everybody. By my count, this has been rather an
extraordinary quarter with double-digit revenue growth and strong operating income growth across all of the business
units. But we've been kind of talking about them separately, with really key important factors that I'd like to focus on
being the retention, the cost management that you have mentioned, that you have talked about, as well as the synergies
and synchronization of the business, the opportunity to do that on the Optum side. And what I'm getting at is that there
was a change in the company back in November. There's been change building over the last several years.
Now we're seeing results. I don't think that was an accident. I think those things are two very clearly related issues. I'm
sensing you're at scale, I'm sensing the business is transforming, and my question therefore is, can you talk about what's
changed in the way you manage this business to get all of these many parts and pieces that are so strong to work
together now better, perhaps, and also in the future? And does that mean that this sort of performance should be more
sustainable?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I'll start and see if my colleagues can join in on this. But I would kind of say
thematically that we have been endeavoring to perform at these levels and at this level of consistency for some time. It
is not just a factor of internal efforts, I think there are external market factors that bring pressures to bear as well, so we
bear some of the responsibility for if we sort of optimize our performance, and some of it is due to kind of external
market dynamics and pressures.
But I think that for the last couple of years, we have been endeavoring to really make the business work together on a
more optimal level across the enterprise. That has been a function of trying to drive a better culture, it has been a
function of trying to achieve a strong chemistry among senior management and a kind of effort where we are working
together and helping each other with both our challenges and opportunities.

And I do think this is a very strong group of people who are committed to working together and to optimizing the
performance and are really focused on serving customers, consumers, care providers, really focused outside and
making sure that we are delivering on the promise of enabling a better healthcare system and really helping people live
healthier lives and get access and services to facilitate that. And I just think that that has come together and it is an
effort, so it is not sustaining, it is making sure that we keep doing this.
And I do think that there is a stronger chemistry among the team today and an emerging, a maturing leadership group
across the board and I'd say it's broad-based. I would say it's not three people or four people, I would say it's 75 people,
100 people across the board. And I think people make a difference and I think that's been part of it. I think we've also
been focused on a culture to make sure that we are collaborating effectively and focusing on serving the markets. So I
think those things have played into it and I will look around -- Dirk McMahon would like to chime in on this.
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Dirk McMahon would like to chime in to this.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Yeah, so, Sheryl, hey. It's Dirk. How are you doing? What I would say is a good example is
the advocate for me call model. That was a joint effort across Optum and UHC, with Optum handing the clinical
pieces. If you look at what we're doing with our service offerings, making sure our digital offerings get consistent,
making sure all of our customer communications are clear and concise and simple. I mean those things are [ph] core
and across (39:49) the enterprise with a lot of quality. So that's a good example of a case where we're managing across.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And I think the decisions – the way we go about making decisions and how we choose
leaders in the organization are really built on – a more focused on collaborating and being ambitious to make sure the
enterprise performs for those who we serve. So I think a lot of factors that are maybe intangibles have contributed to
that. And I think you're just seeing some of the effort start to emerge and I think we can do better. So I am hoping
you're seeing the beginning of what we can do going forward, but we have to keep working on it. Thanks for the
question. Next please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from A. J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - A. J. Rice>: Hello, everybody. I might follow up with another Catamaran consolidation question. I guess the
$0.30 in EPS accretion that we're looking for next year, I assume that's after plowing back some of the opportunity for
the underlying customer base. So I assume that the overall opportunity from putting the two together is more than what
will be reflected in the $0.30. Can you give us some flavor of what might be plowed back to the combined entity's
clients?
And I know one of the issues that's been raised, and I wanted to just have you to comment on it, is that Catamaran has a
lot of health plan members or clients, and I know in Optum like OptumInsight has a lot of business with other health
plans. Can you just comment on how that relationship works? I know there seems to be some concern that people may
view as a competitor but how has your experience been in Optum working with other health plans?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Well, there's several in there. It is premature for us to get specific about elements
related to a transaction that is still really subject to approval and so forth. But kind of thematically, I would offer that
the accretion is really more a function of the transaction itself, the capital we deployed relative to the cost of that capital
against the earnings stream of Catamaran as it is.
We are clearly focused on driving the overwhelming majority of the benefits and synergies that arise from this back to
customers, improving the value proposition, improving and progressing a PBM model that is distinctive in the
marketplace. And we are really focused on the customers benefiting principally from that, of which UnitedHealthcare is
a customer as well, but also as you point out, very important customers that are other payers in the marketplace, very,
very good companies.

And those relationships are clearly important and vital to this model going forward and we are committed to delivering
on all commitments related to that, and really developing and delivering a supporting capability to their PBM
strategies, so that we produce for them a distinctive capability, an advantage into the marketplace, and to meet their
specifications as they see it, and become a very trusted partner in this category. I think we are a trusted partner in this –
for a variety of payers and care providers across the spectrum in Optum, and our business has continued to grow and
evolve there. And Larry, I don't know if you want to comment on that.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Hi, A.J. It's Larry. So good points that you made and good question. And we live this every
day. And I'll kind of reiterate almost everything Steve just said. But obviously I have spoken to quite a few of the
customers, but maybe what you want to think about a little bit is frame what we do today. If you look at OptumHealth
and you look at OptumInsight, you would find that if we have internal and external customers, that's pretty balanced
between the internal and external breakdown. If you look at what's really happening with the Catamaran transaction, it
will get very close to being balanced as well.
But some of the things that we heard as we've talked to the existing clients and so forth, and this was what Steve said, is
that the reason we bought and entered into this combination with Catamaran was because we needed scale. We needed
enhanced technology, we needed specialty and synchronization programs, we needed a well-rounded management
team, and this was all a complementary business. Well, that's the same reasons that people want to do business with us.
They have those same interests. And that's why we believe we really marry up really, really well with this new model.
Now some of the things that we're going to have to do is we're going to have to execute. We're going to have to execute
day one as we get involved with new customers. We're going to have to live up to commitments that have been made,
and we know that and we're pretty good at that. There's going to have to be total transparency. Today, we do business
with 300 health plans. We do business with 4,500 hospitals. So we're used to really working with a lot of people and
having to have transparency and this is just going to be another aspect of it. Obviously privacy and security around
information and data, and we're going to have to come up with a way that we believe is going to be pretty easy for no
disruption, because we are on the same technology platform and we've been on that platform for about 10 years.
So overall, we feel pretty good about this transaction, but I think if you went back and you looked at what we do in
OptumHealth, you would find that a lot of these clients are already clients of ours and they already work with us on
various intervention and prevention and wellness programs. You would find the same with OptumInsight. So overall,
we kind of know this model, and I would say as long as we execute and as long as we execute and as long as we
execute, we should be fine.
<Q - A. J. Rice>: All right. Great. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Next question, please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Great. Maybe if I can ask a similar question in a little bit different way. When we think
about the accretion of $0.30, my understanding is that it's versus not deploying the capital elsewhere, but you've already
kind of talked about a $0.07 headwind so far this year from cutting back on share repurchase, and I guess you could do
that again next year to bring leverage back down. How do you think about kind of the net accretion versus if you had
continued your previous capital deployment plan in 2016? And then I understand the concept of returning the
overwhelming majority of the benefits back to the customers, but usually we don't think of year one as being the high
water mark from an accretion perspective. I mean where does that $0.30 number go to in year two and year three?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, first of all, we're not providing that level of guidance, particularly at this early stage.
But we think that this deployment of capital is compelling relative to the market opportunities and I think the
capabilities we can bring to the marketplace. So we think that this business will continue to grow. We think that it will

become more effective serving customers and it will become more effective as a business, and particularly in the
market dynamics that we see ahead as specialty pharma continues to emerge in the marketplace, where there's going to
require greater information, greater clinical engagement. So we think this is a very good use of capital.
It will be an important business broadly for the marketplace, serving all sectors of the markets where prescriptions are
engaged. And we expect this to grow. So we don't expect this accretion to flatten out or trend. We expect the business
to actually improve year-by-year, and so we would expect that contribution to grow, and it would grow, we think, much
more than would be a share buyback, if that's what you're using as an example.
Our orientation to deploying capital is to find growth opportunities that align with our strategic capabilities, and that is
our priority in terms of deploying capital. Paying dividends and share buyback is really when we really have excess
capital, if you will, to bear. So we are very pleased with this and we will continue to look for investment opportunities
not only in this area but in our other Optum services and in our benefits businesses where we think there would maybe
opportunities down the road. I don't know if that gets to your – Larry?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. Kevin, I'll get a little bit more granular. And maybe this is not where you were going,
but I'm kind of being held responsible here for that $0.30 in 2016. And the way that I look at it, you've got some factors
that we have to pay attention to very, very carefully right now such as client retention, such as sales, such as our
operating leverage, our customer service and our management. All of these things that we really have control of inside
of Optum and how we manage the business and with the combination of Catamaran, who has a strong management
team, who has strong experience, strong relationships, this is a very, very strong management team. And so we feel
confident, there are a lot of levers that we can use and pull to go towards that $0.30.
Now I'm not even talking about network discounts and I'm not talking about drug spend at this point in time, because as
we talked about, some of these categories will go back to others and our clients as we work with them. So, we're
confident from what I'll call an operating plan standpoint what we have to do by 2016.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thanks for the question. Next question, please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Hi there. At your Investor Day, you indicated you expect to achieve your long-term
earnings growth target of 13% to 16% in 2016. Recognizing now that the 2015 EPS was going to be higher than you
expected, is that objective still on track? And as you look into 2016, you mentioned that rates aren't keeping up with
cost trends in Medicare, could you comment on your other lines of business, how you see headwinds, tailwinds?
Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. On the other lines of business, I'll ask Jeff, Austin and Steve maybe to respond. In
terms of our overall, we are not changing our outlook with respect to our long-term growth trends or we had no
intention of suggesting that. We still feel confident that in the long term that our businesses are capable of producing
growth in that range. And we are hopefully seeing our performance start to recover back into that range. So as it relates
to the individual businesses, maybe I'll start with Steve Nelson.
<A - Steven Nelson>: Sure. Thanks, Steve. Hi, Christine; Steve Nelson. With respect to the Medicare business, it's
really well positioned for now and will even increasingly improve for 2016 to serve more seniors, which is really our
objective, provide not just better benefits but great health outcomes and a better healthcare experience. And I'll just tell
you how kind of we think about that as we are in the, as you know, in the midst of our 2016 benefit planning period.
We have now shaped our networks in a really meaningful way. We have added premiums, so just under half of our
total membership has a premium, which was an important transition and something that we needed to do and executed
that this year. Making great progress on [ph] Stars (53:30), we have a really strong clinical programs and customer
service innovations and improvement that not only, as I said, provide good benefits but create a better healthcare

experience for our members, and we have great market share and brand positions. So when you couple this with the
growth of the population and an increased propensity that choose Medicare Advantage over fee-for-service, it's a really
strong position and very positive outlook. Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Morning, Christine. It's Jeff Alter. I think the commercial business shares a very positive view of the
future. We've been through a tough couple of years with a lot of headwinds and a lot of disruptions from the ACA,
which tended to I think mute our ability to manage trend better than some others. And I think as we go into 2015, 2016
and beyond, kind of the combined power of Optum and UnitedHealthcare working together to keep trends lower, keep
our pricing lower, I think you should expect the growth that we've had over the last six months or so to really be what
distinguishes us going forward. And that's delivering more and more value to the marketplace through different product
designs but more important, over the long run, better management of costs and delivering that better management back
through lower pricing and growth to the marketplace.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Austin?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Sure. Good morning. This is Austin. Strong momentum continues in our Medicaid business.
We're very honored to continue to see strong growth. We look for that growth to continue throughout the year and into
the future. Really built on very strong relationships with our state partners, strong clinical programs focused on getting
better outcomes, high-quality outcomes for the constituents. And overall, I think we've been able to demonstrate, over
time in partnership with those states, value. And that sustained value we think is what really continues to create that
momentum moving forward.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So I think pretty solid across the board in terms of the – and the Optum business continues
to be strong, the backlogs pipeline in Optum continues to grow and the revenue backlog continues to grow actually at a
faster pace than what we're actually showing in our reported results, so I'm pretty positive in that regard.
We'll take maybe two more questions. So the next one please?

We'll take our next question from Ana Gupte do with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering on this Optum [ph] UHC (56:17) better
together. Is that strengthened or less strong if you will, post the Catamaran transaction? And how would that be [ph]
informed (56:26) by your 2016-2017 selling season, and any other milestones that might [ph] inform (56:33) one
decision versus the other?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I would say just broadly that kind of coming back to an earlier question, that I think
the chemistry and the operating dynamics across the businesses continue to mature and get better. I think we have a
very strong generation of leaders here and they are working together. In terms of this particular transaction, a lot of
work done at the corporate level in terms of the actual development and execution of a transaction of this caliber, and
then working with the Optum team and the OptumRx team, that has been probably the orientation at this point in time.
So I would say, as it relates to that transaction, I think it was our – I think we had really good capabilities in our
corporate development organization, our treasury organization and so forth. And then they take the business expertise
from the Optum team, really where our PBM resides. So that is probably – that flavor was probably played out more in
that. But I would tell you that the better together dynamic across our businesses has never actually been better. And as I
said earlier, I think, and certainly it's our intent, that this is just the beginning. Next question please?

<Q - Sean W. Wieland>: Thank you. Long time listener, first-time caller. Thanks for taking my question. So this week
you said that Optum360 and Mayo is getting together. Mayo, as you know, is also embarking on their implementation
of Epic. So that's a lot of cooks in the kitchen. Can you comment on the value proposition to Mayo given their
simultaneous rollout of Epic and how you're going to manage this? And also can you tell us what the organic growth
was in the OptumHealth business? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, welcome, Sean, and maybe Bill Miller can touch on Mayo and John, perhaps your
last question?
<A - Bill Miller>: Yes, Sean. This is Bill. I'll answer the implementation work going on down at Epic. It's a very
insightful question because that is a lot of things going on. And it was instrumental in part of our discussion as we
arrived at our relationship with Mayo, because what we will do is work in concert with them with respect to their
rollout of Epic. But as they evaluated that and they looked at our tools, the combination of our tools working with their
existing systems and the systems they're going to install, they felt like they wanted to move ahead because they were
independent and the best in the market as they saw them.
And there were other things that we're going to work on collectively that I think enhance Mayo's position around
patient engagement and some of the things that they want to solve for from a consumer perspective, which we're going
to work with them, particularly in the context of revenue management. So they are comfortable with the so-called
cooks in the kitchen. We'll collaborate in that context, and there is not that much overlap and where they are – where
there is, we've accounted for it in the project plan. So we feel very comfortable about going forward.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: John?
<A - John Rex>: Yes. Sean, this is John Rex. So OptumHealth did have very good top line growth in the quarter, as
you noted, 27% top line growth. I would say all the businesses contributing, if I were to call out certain businesses in
terms of where we saw particular strength that I want to note on the call, I'd call it the Optum care businesses. So those
are the care delivery businesses, certainly one of the big five drivers that we talked about extensively at the Investor
Day back in December in terms of where our focus was over the next five years. Driving that growth, it was really
growth in patients served in our existing markets. It was also de novo expansion – new market expansion, really
heavily along those areas in terms of driving the vast majority of growth with OptumHealth in the quarter.
Stephen J. Hemsley
So just to sum up the quarter, the story is really again about growth, growth in revenues and earnings based on more
consistent performance for customers, growth in the number of people we partner with and serve across the healthcare
system, and growth in the scope and diversity of our businesses. So we thank you and we'll see you next quarter. Thank
you.
