As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our
financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. In addition, the release includes historical financial
results of our North America, International and Amazon Web Services reportable segments for 2014 and 2013.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this
webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website; you will find additional disclosures
regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless other otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period
of 2014.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Brian T. Olsavsky
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow
increased 47% to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion. In the supplemental
financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow
measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and
equipment, with cash and through capital and finance leases. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.68 billion.
Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease
obligations.
Return on invested capital was 14%, up from 9%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow, divided by average total
assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The
combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million
one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72 billion, or 22%, excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from
year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Active customer accounts was
approximately 278 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period,
worldwide active customers were approximately 260 million, up from approximately 230 million in the comparable
prior-year period. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 44% of paid
units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.40 billion, or 67.8%
of revenue, compared with 71.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A, combined was $6.62
billion, or 29.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.67 billion or 11.7% of
revenue, compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $2.52 billion or 11.1% of revenue, compared with 9.2%.
Marketing was $1.05 billion or 4.6% of revenue, compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report
North America, International and Amazon Web Services. In addition, we have provided historical results for these
segments for 2014 and 2013, with our earnings release filing today. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to
segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM
revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, representing 76% of North America revenues. North America segment operating
income increased 79% to $517 million, a 3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign
exchange, North America segment operating income increased 77%.
In the International segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year
unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.32 billion, or
increased 2%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 4% to $5.38 billion, or 21% excluding foreign

exchange. EGM now represents 69% of International revenues. International segment operating loss was $76 million,
compared to a loss of $33 million in the prior-year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange to
International segment operating loss was $78 million.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating
income increased 8% to $265 million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign
exchange, AWS segment operating income decreased 13%. Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to
$706 million, or 3.1% of revenue, up approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact
from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 45%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based
compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 million compared to $146
million in the prior-year period. Our income tax expense was $71 million. GAAP net loss was $57 million or negative
$0.12 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $108 million or $0.23 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $5.12 billion year-over-year to $13.78 billion.
Inventory increased 10% to $7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8 turns, down from 9.1 turns a year ago, as we
expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 13%
to $11.92 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've
seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently
unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding
exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict
demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues, such as settling inter-company balances and foreign
currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates, can
all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business
acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation
estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2, 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion, or growth of between 7% and 18%. This
guidance anticipates approximately 750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP
operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and a positive $50 million of income compared to a $15
million loss in second quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and
amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based
compensation and other operating expense, to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to $404 million in
the second quarter of 2014.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We
believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.
Phil Hardin
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how

Thank you. At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit
yourself to one question. [Operation Instructions]
Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed. Your line is live.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Thank you. Can you share with us any updated metrics for Prime Now? How sticky is it in terms
of repeat customers, average order value or other details? And also, any update on your fulfillment center plans for the
year? If you can't disclose specific numbers, maybe you could just qualitatively tell us your focus, either domestic
versus international or sortation versus traditional FC build out? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. On the Prime Now, we don't have specific metrics we want to share today, but we
have expanded to seven cities with more on the way. Customers are really enjoying the one-hour and two-hour delivery
of tens of thousands of daily essential products, so the response has been great. We'll point out that our operations
network that we've been building for the last 20 years helps make Prime Now a viable proposition for us. The scale
makes it possible. So really, so far, customer response has been great.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: And, Brian, on the FCs, you know as we've done in prior years, it's early in the year, and as
we progress through the year, we'll give you some updates on how many. But there's a reminder, we ended the year
with 109 fulfillment centers around the world, and we'll update you as we go.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: Great. Thanks for the new disclosure, guys, really helpful. I guess just digging in on that a little
bit, we all understand the investments you guys are making on International retail and maybe why that margin has been
declining, but can you give us some color on what's driving up the North America retail segment margin? And I guess
in the context of that, just talk about the impact that Prime is having on the retail margin for both North America and
International? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Yeah, sure. So North America operating margin, up 120 basis points year-over-year to
3.9%. A lot of good cost efficiency, but again, we're continuing to invest selectively, as we build the Prime platform, an
event on behalf of customers. So you'll see a lot of invention, definitely to feed the Prime platform, which things like
video content, Prime Music, as we talked about, Prime Now devices, and we continue to build fulfillment centers for a
selection and expansion and FBA. So that's – it's generally what's driving the operating margin in North America.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah. And just to add on to that, we're – we gave metrics last quarter about Prime. It's
growing very fast. As Brian said, we're feeding the platform and it's really the common thing with category expansion,
new FCs, original content, Prime Instant Video devices, Prime Now. The common theme is, they're all really
intertwined with Prime and they're inextricably linked to our consumer business in Prime. So it's just, we're happy to do
it. And the last quarter, we gave an indication of the growth rates after being at it for 10 years. So we're super excited to
have the platform and continuing to invest in it.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thanks for taking the question. Could you guys talk a little bit more just about the
International business and kind of the key initiatives here in terms of getting the growth to re-accelerate from these
levels? And then also perhaps a little bit more on your strategy in China? How you're thinking about the cost structure
there relative to previous years? And some of the key ways you might be able to rationalize things there? Thanks.

<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Yeah, let me start with China. So, I think you'll see a lot of invention. You're seeing a lot of
invention from us in China right now. Amazon is a trusted source of authentic international products, and that's really
what we're doubling down on now with a Amazon Global Store on our own site, which gives Chinese customers access
to over 1 million Amazon products globally. And then the TMall flagship store for international brands, which you've
heard about, giving thousands of direct-imported products access -customers access to these products, and those happen
to be stocked and ready-to-ship from our fulfillment centers in China, so that's an added benefit. 25% of those are
exclusive – over 25% of those are exclusives to Amazon. So, we continue to be selective in our investments there, but
we're taking the long-term view, and we have hopes for the new initiatives with the Global Store and the TMall
flagship store.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the growth for total International, just maybe some comments, first about the
current quarter and then I'll elaborate a little bit further. But the growth was down 2% on a dollar basis, up 14% on a
local currency basis, so we did see a little bit of improvement in terms of growth rate acceleration versus the last couple
of quarters. And in addition to the things that Brian mentioned earlier about the Prime platform, that's something that
we're doing globally. And so we're certainly – all of those things we're working on globally, so those are things that, at
least in most geographies, we have today.
One thing to keep in mind, also, as you look at the growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1, we talked about on April 1 there
was consumption tax increase in Japan. We had some – we think some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1
of this year. So it's a headwind, if you think about it for Q1. But we're looking – we think there's still a big opportunity,
as we mentioned in last call, big opportunity with Prime. Prime is growing at a faster rate. We think there's still a great
opportunity to add unique selection for category expansion. And again, so we're going to continue to feed the Prime
platform, as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories.
We're also very excited about India. If you take a look at our results from an operating profit standpoint, you see that it
was approximately negative $76 million on a dollar basis. If you back out exchange, that's approximately breakeven.
Included in there, we certainly have a sizable step-up in investment in India and we're super excited from what we see
there right now. We think it's very – a big opportunity and we're investing appropriately for that big opportunity. So
those are some of the things that we're working on, and we think there – we still have a lot of opportunity there going
forward.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two. The first one is on the new AWS disclosure;
can you just help us on accounting question, the AWS data center costs related to the core e-commerce business, are
those being allocated to North America and International, or are those being fully embedded into the AWS segment?
And then the second question goes back to China. I guess any early learnings from the TMall partnership? And whether
you have new thoughts of potentially a lower capital intensive growth strategy in China?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: To answer your first question, yes, they are – the associated infrastructure costs to run our
North America and International consumer business, those costs, those infrastructure costs are being allocated to those
segments. The second question, in terms of China, it's early. We're liking certainly some of the things that we're seeing
there, but there's not a lot I can add to that at this stage.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Thank you.

<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Great. Thanks. Maybe just another follow-up on the new segment disclosure. Thanks for
breaking that out. If we assume that the advertising – other segment is reasonably profitable, then the implication is
then the core retail business is very modestly profitable, close to break even. And just wondering what the thought
process and strategy is behind that, if, in a sense, there's some subsidy to the retail side being used, as you build market
share in the core business? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah. I think the best way to think about it is, we certainly have an advertising part of our
North American consumer segments. But the way you should think about it is, we are making some great investments
for the long-term, and that's really what's reflected in the operating results that you're seeing, in terms of – so it is
certainly impacting the operating margins, both for North America and International. So, it's the things that we're, both
Brian and I talked about, that we're doing globally to support the Prime platform. All of those things that we
mentioned; video content, original content, Prime Now, category expansion, investing on behalf of FBA, which also
helps Prime devices. Those are all intertwined and certainly part of that.
And then some of the things outside of that are more specifically related to International, in addition to those are some
of the geographic stuff that we talked about. So I think you should think about it that way. That certainly, we think it's a
big opportunity. And again, one of the reasons I wanted to give you an update last quarter on Prime growth, and you
can see the – that, that's going very well. And so we're feeding that, and that's what we have been doing and that's what
you see also and certainly results that you're seeing today.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: All right. Helpful. Thanks very much.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks for taking my questions. On the International revenue, I believe there's probably a –
there's a real distinction here between some of your most established countries and some of your more emerging
countries. Wonder if you could talk a little bit about for Germany and the UK and Japan and some of the more
established markets, what the profit profile of those markets look like? And just how much of the International segment
results are being – the losses being held back by a handful of the more emerging markets?
And then a question on AWS pricing, it seemed like the pricing environment was pretty competitive last year. What are
you seeing in the market this year? And what are your expectations going forward? Are you expecting a bit more of a
stable pricing environment? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, in terms of International, we're not breaking out individual country results. The one
thing that I did mention around, from a country perspective, was India, in terms of, we certainly stepped up our
investment in – if you look at it year-over-year, so that's certainly reflected in the numbers that you're seeing.
In terms of AWS, we've had 48 price decreases since inception. The team is doing a terrific job in terms of working on
behalf of customers to pass on savings as they see it. But in terms of any comment on what to expect going forward,
there's not really much to add there.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: It probably is worth adding that although price is a factor, the primary factor for customers
is choosing to move to AWS is really around their ability to move quickly and to be nimble and agile. And so we're
very pleased with the kind of continued adoption and usage growth we've seen. And obviously, the benefits of AWS
around their ability, customers' ability to be nimble is a primary factor there.

<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. My first question is about the profitability
of the North America segment. You mentioned a few minutes ago that investments in Prime were part of the – or most
of the explanation for what is a relatively low 3.9% margin in North America, which are much lower than the 5% to 6%
EBIT margin that the brick-and-mortar retailer books, despite the large benefit of booking [ph] 3P net (25:35). Here's
the question. Prime is not new in North America. You probably have tens of millions of Prime users in the U.S., 30
million, 40 million, 50 million, yet margins are still low. What gives you confidence that the investments that you are
making will pay off?
Second question on AWS; if you look at expenses like R&D, perhaps even the fixed component of marketing and sales,
which presumably one day will be really fixed, are they still growing significantly? In other words, is there room for
significant margin expansion at some point in the future, when AWS is, I don't know, three, five or 10 times its current
size? Or do you expect R&D to scale up at the same rate as revenues? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of your first question, specifically related to North America, one of the comments
we made last quarter, that we disclosed was, we disclosed the growth rate globally, as well as the growth rate in the
U.S. And the growth rate in the U.S. after 10 years is up 50%, it was up 50% year-over-year, and so 2014 versus 2013,
in terms of Prime membership. And that's after a price increase on Prime from $79 to $99. So it gives you a feel for the
work that we've put into Prime to make that experience great for customers and the value that we're giving them, so
again, given that growth. And so that's what – that's certainly one of the things that gives us comfort.
But when we look at the individual pieces, we like what we see. So in other words, some of the investments we're
making, I think as we've talked about in the past, one example would be video content, both original and licensed
content. We mentioned, last call, that we spent approximately 1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers, and
what we've seen to-date is, it's certainly still an investment for us? It's certainly impacting our operating results, but we
like what we see. We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline, if you will, for video content; they
convert at a higher rate. We have a great retention of Prime members, but those who stream actually we retain those at
a higher rate. And when we bring in new customers through our video pipeline, the purchasing pattern that we have for
those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipelines.
So in other words, they're buying very good from a physical product standpoint as well as digital. So they're buying a
diverse set of products. So in other words, the video content that we're spending is helping us. Customers will buy
consumables from us, they'll buy clothing from us, they'll buy shoes from us, they'll buy electronics, they'll buy media
items. So that's what we're seeing. And so, again, it's some of these things are very early. We'll have to see over time
how efficient they are, but each period we go, we keep – the data that we see we're encouraged, and so that's just one
example. But that's why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it's a great – the Prime platform, if you will, we
think it's a great opportunity. And as I mentioned earlier, all of these things we're investing in are very intertwined.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: And, Carlos, I think you had a question about AWS. From our perspective, it's a business
that's still really in day one, a lot of potential innovation in front of us, we believe, and so you can see we're putting a
lot of CapEx obviously there, including capital leases, and we think over time we will be able to generate significant
free cash flow and strong ROICs.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks. I want to go back at this North American retail margins, and I guess I want to try to
figure out, I know you're not going to go out where they could go, but if we look in the past, I assume that if the base in
2014 and in full-year 2013 was probably depressed for North American retail margins, North American segment
margins, and if we look back five, six years, it's probable that that was running at kind of mid-to-high single digits
CSOI margins, kind of similar to the incremental margins you just reported for that segment, 8.7%. So I guess the big

question I want to ask is, is there structural change in the North American retail business over the next – this year and
the next couple of years versus what you had call it in 2004 to 2009 when the margins were I think pretty clearly higher
and now you're going to be recovering to those levels? That's what I'm trying to get at. Any color would be great.
Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, thanks for the question, Mark. Just in terms of going forward, we're not giving any
specific guidance beyond the current quarter, so I can't predict for you what could happen. But what you mentioned is
in some of the periods that you were describing is you mentioned what would our business looked like several years
ago when Prime was nascent and we were a bit earlier in the business, and so we go through different cycles. We're
certainly still investing very heavily. That being said, as I mentioned last quarter, we're spending time on making sure
that we get productivity, so we're working on both investing heavily in the business, we're working on fixed and
variable productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into. That's what's helping us with the improvement that
Brian mentioned in terms of operating margins year-over-year. There're a number of different aspects, but certainly mix
of business and some productivity is certainly impacting that.
But, again, we think there's opportunities to improve margins over time. You'll have to stay tuned on that to see what it
looks like, but we certainly, as you can see from not only results but some of the data points that we've given over the
last several quarters, we are investing heavily in the business, again, because we like what we see and, again, Prime
growing so dramatically globally after being in it for a long time, and we think that that's a great platform to feed.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Okay. Thanks, Tom.

Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Hey, a couple of questions on margins. First on AWS, I think those are higher than most of us were
thinking, appreciate the disclosure. What is driving your margin versus your pricing decision? How do you think about
passing through cost efficiencies or potential margin growth through to customers?
And then secondly, on International margins, clearly below history, below the U.S., what kind of things need to happen
to get those at least to where the U.S. is today, much less back to where they were six or seven years ago? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Justin, I'll take the AWS portion of the question first. So our model over the long-term
really has been to innovate and to use our scale and position to be able to pass savings along to customers and so we've
had 48 price decreases since we launched. As I talked about earlier, that's one factor, customers save a lot of money,
but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables and the ability for developers to move
really quickly.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the international, again, as you mentioned, Justin, we are investing a lot right
now, which impacts the margins there, again ex-exchange, think of it as approximately breakeven for the quarter. And
so, again, we're continuing to invest. We're investing in all of the things that we talked about relating to the platform,
continuing to invest in some emerging geographies, most notably certainly India with the step-up given the experience
we have and so we are optimistic over time. We have a lot to do there. We think it's a great opportunity for us, and so
that's what we're doing. But we're excited about the opportunity and that's why you see the results that you're seeing
there.

Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think of the run
rate of CapEx and capital lease obligations in the quarter as any sort of indication for full year and the trajectory of

investment in the fulfillment and data centers. And then just on the question of Prime and Prime Video, as we think
about the way that media growth is trending now, is there a point where you start to think about allocating Prime, some
of these those Prime revenues to media to account for the – as
Prime Video usage increases?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, in terms of the CapEx question, there's certainly two pieces of that. There's the
consumer, the North America, International piece, there're a number of pieces, but certainly the two largest pieces
would certainly be the CapEx associated with fulfillment and the second would be infrastructure, and again that's for
AWS versus North America, International. I'll take the North America, International first. We're seeing good growth
and year-over-year in terms of overall unit growth, in terms of revenue growth, certainly ex-exchange. As I mentioned
earlier, it's early in the year, so as we do every year, we'll continue to monitor the growth there, we're making plans for
the rest of the year and we'll get back to you as we progress throughout the year in terms of what fulfillment capacity
we'll need to support that growth this year. In terms of Web Services, it's obviously growing extremely fast. We saw
some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective over the last few quarters here. Usage is growing faster than
that, so we will be deploying more capital as we go there. In terms of the amounts, specific amounts, we're not giving
guidance on that today, and then one of the reasons is it's just growing so fast that we want to make sure we put the
right amount of capital in place and the team is doing a great job doing all the planning and the execution around that,
so that's what we're doing there.
In terms of media, I'm not fully sure I understood the question, but as it relates to I think it's video, could you repeat
that part of question?
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Right. I was just getting a sense of as video such a – becomes a bigger part of the Prime value
proposition, do you start to allocate some of the annual revenues from Prime more directly into that media segment
because of the level of usage associated with Prime Video versus the shipping benefits of Prime?
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Heath, we do allocate some Prime to account for the video.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Thanks for the question.

Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Eugene Charles Munster>: Good afternoon. Could you talk a little bit about the focus on same day and same
hour and specifically about the incremental investments in just some context to how big of those investments are? And
separately is what the strategic advantage is this something ultimately – obviously it's to improve the experience, but do
you see in any of your data that this opens you up to being more competitive with traditional retailers? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Yeah. I'll take that one. You know, we, certainly as I said earlier, see this as a natural
extension of our existing infrastructure investment. We've 109 fulfillment centers, again, very close to customers. It
allows us and locks for us same day and next key deliveries and to its extreme, one-hour and two-hour deliveries as
you've seen with Prime Now. So we're not forecasting or giving much more on that, but we definitely see it as a
valuable customer proposition. Customers embraced it. Again, a smaller number of [ph] asons (39:24), tens of
thousands of [ph] asons (39:27) but available for one, two-hour delivery and generally in the category of essential
products that you would need in a short time period.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: The only thing I would add to that, as Brian mentioned earlier as well, we're in seven cities
today and there'd be more to come. We haven't said how many but you should be definitely expecting more to come
and we're very excited to do that.

Our next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - Robert S. Peck>: Yes. Thank you. I was wondering, Tom, could you give us an update on your retail store
strategy? Should we expect stores to open up across the U.S. or is that something you're just limited trying out in New
York. And then number two, India has come up a couple of times on the call today. China had several structural
challenges just based on the market there. I was curious if you could differentiate what you're seeing that's different in
India versus the China challenges. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, in terms of our consumer business, we love the business that we have today. We
love – we think there's a great opportunity to do that, to continue to expand the existing business that we have. In terms
of other things, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we might or might not do there. In terms of
the second part, India and China, could you repeat that part? Sorry.
<Q - Robert S. Peck>: Sure. So you talked about India a couple of times today on the call. Obviously it's a big area of
investment and focus for the company. China had some structural challenges just based on how the marketplace is. I
was wondering if you could differentiate what you're seeing in India that makes you optimistic there versus some of the
challenges you faced in China?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah. Thank you for the question. They are very different. You'll see the growth rate in
India's very rapid. We talked about last year and it's increasing our investment. I think the biggest difference is the
focus on sellers and the connection of sellers. A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers all across India to
succeed and grow their online businesses. You'll see from our press release that we've launched some new apps for that
so that helps them manage their inventory better and also respond to customer inquiries. So that's probably the biggest
difference that we see between India and China, but – and still very, very early on in India.

Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Jason S. Helfstein>: Thanks. So can you talk about how the impact on available third party SKUs impacts the
business, particularly in Europe? And ultimately what you could do to drive more SKUs through the platform, whether
it's lowering third party rate or are there other factors to try to get more SKUs on there for third party? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We've spent a tremendous amount of time on our seller business over the years and trying
to improve both the experience for sellers as well as customers, and we've done a lot of interesting things to help sellers
and that's why you see the results that we're seeing today. 44% of our units today, as of this quarter, are third party
units. That's up about 400 basis points from last year. Certainly one of the things that we've talked about that's notable
is Fulfillment by Amazon. And so the benefit for sellers is they get to take advantage of our multi-node fulfillment
network globally, we have 109 fulfillment centers globally, as well as our customers get to take advantage of that as
Prime members, where we offer it in those geographies. So, it's really a great benefit for sellers. It's good for sellers. It's
good for customers, and we believe good for share owners too.
So again, we're very excited. A number of different things we're working on, but certainly, one of the drivers, along
with all the things that I mentioned, is certainly, FBA is very helpful.

Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair & Company.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Good afternoon. Looking at the service sales less the AWS revenues, you've got about $4
billion in fees, mostly coming from the marketplace, up a strong mid-30%. Can you help us think about the costs that

go against those marketplace fees? And specifically within fulfillment, if you could help us understand how much of
the cost is going against 3P or basically FBA fulfillment? Perhaps percent of units out of the FCs that are going to 3P?
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: So, Mark, I can't comment on the derived number, but I can say that FBA continues to grow
really well. It's become a bigger and bigger part of our third-party mix over the years; I think we gave you an update in
Q4, that it was more than 40% of our third-party units. Obviously, in the fulfillment line, there is cost associated with
that, as well as our other third-party units as well, with things like payment processing and other costs that we incur.
So, I don't know that there's much more we can say about that.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: If I can insert a second question, given the upside in profitability in the first quarter, the
guidance for the second quarter, quite a bit lower, is there – what are the factors you see that are negatives? Or I guess
otherwise people are going to think you're sandbagging. Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Well if you take a look at the guidance that we gave, again, we gave, as we have in previous
quarters, we give a wide range. And from a consolidated segment operating income standpoint, we gave $100 million
to $650 million, the implied margin at the lower end. The higher end is approximately 50 basis points, upwards to
2.9%. This quarter in Q1, we were up 60 basis points year-over-year in total. At the upper end of that forecast, the
implied will be up 80 basis points. So again, that's the range and we think it's appropriate range for Q2.

And our final question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to margins and a little bit more on
AWS. As I look at the seasonality, I wonder if there's any seasonality in margins because it looks like margins in 2Q
and 3Q came in sub-10%, versus maybe mid-teens in 4Q and 1Q. And then sort of looking at it a different way, maybe
given the dip in profitability in 2Q of last year, did that have any impact from the pricing cuts in April? Thanks very
much.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: So let's start with the increase you saw sequentially in margin from Q2 – or Q3 to Q4 of
2014. So revenue grew by about 21.5% sequentially. And expense grew by around 10%, and so obviously we were
growing faster on top line than our expenses. And over the long-term, improvements in efficiency and innovation allow
us to drive that kind of cost out of the business. I mean there certainly was an impact with pricing changes, and you
probably saw some of that in Q2 as well. But over the long-term, that's the model we follow.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Great. Thank you.
