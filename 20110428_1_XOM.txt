MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the ExxonMobil Corporation first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Today's call is
being recorded.
At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and
Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal
Good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is
ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2011.
I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. But before we go further, I
would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement, shown on slide two.
Moving to slide three, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results.
The global economic recovery remains uncertain, as a result of continued sovereign debt concerns, inflationary
measures in major non-OECD countries, and the events in Japan. Energy markets are experiencing greater uncertainty
with the political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East. These events, along with the effects of the weak U.S.
dollar, have resulted in significantly higher crude oil prices. Natural gas prices outside the United States also increased
relative to the first quarter of 2010.
In addition, refining margins in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region improved relative to a weak first quarter
2010 environment for the downstream. We also saw strong chemical margins, especially commodity margins in the

United States and Europe.
Turning now to the first quarter financial results, as shown on slide four, ExxonMobil's first quarter 2011 earnings
excluding special items were $10.7 billion, an increase of $4.4 billion from the first quarter of 2010. Our effective tax
rate for the quarter was 47%. Earnings per share for the quarter excluding special items were $2.14, up $0.81 from a
year ago.
The corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share
purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the second quarter of 2011.
CapEx in the first quarter was $7.8 billion, up over $900 million from the first quarter of 2010, reflecting the increase
in our U.S. unconventional activities. Across our diverse portfolio, we continue to invest in robust projects through the
business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas, and finished products.
Our cash generation remains very strong, with $18.2 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of
the first quarter of 2011, our cash balance was $13.2 billion, and debt was $15.9 billion. The next slide provides
additional detail on first quarter sources and uses of cash.
Over the quarter, our cash balance grew from $8.5 billion to $13.2 billion, a combined impact of strong earnings,
depreciation expense, lower working capital, and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $18.2
billion of cash flow from operations. Uses of cash included additions to plant, property, and equipment, or PP&E, of
$7.1 billion, and shareholder distributions of $7.2 billion.
We will now provide a review of segmented results, starting on slide six. ExxonMobil's first quarter 2011 earnings of
$10.7 billion increased $4.4 billion or 69% from the first quarter of 2010, with strong results across all business lines.
Upstream earnings increased $2.9 billion, while downstream earnings improved by $1.1 billion, and chemical earnings
grew about $270 million.
Corporate and financing expenses of $640 million during the quarter were down $160 million versus the first quarter of
2010, due mainly to the absence of the tax charge related to the U.S. healthcare legislation, and remained within our
continued guidance of $500 million to $700 million per quarter.
As shown on slide seven, ExxonMobil's first quarter 2011 earnings of $10.7 billion increased $1.4 billion from the
fourth quarter of 2010, mainly due to higher earnings in the upstream and chemical businesses.
Moving next to the upstream results and beginning on slide eight, ExxonMobil, along with our co-venturers, reached a
major production milestone in the redevelopment of the West Qurna 1 oil field in southern Iraq. We achieved the
improved production target under the contract by increasing production 10% above the initial field production rate of
244,000 barrels per day gross. The current field production is now about 320,000 barrels per day gross. Day-to-day
operations have been transferred to the West Qurna 1 field operating division, which is staffed by personnel from the
South Oil Company and ExxonMobil. Operations include drilling new wells, working over existing wells, and
debottlenecking and optimizing facilities. We currently have three drilling rigs operating in the field and expect to add
additional rigs during the year.
Turning now to our exploration and development activities on slide nine, beginning with our deepwater activity in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where ExxonMobil holds 2.1 million net acres, we are currently drilling the Hadrian-5
exploration well, which spud in March, within several days of receiving permit approval from the Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management. Hadrian-5 is a further evaluation of the Hadrian North oil complex. The Hadrian South gas
discovery is fully appraised.
As you know, we and other members of the Marine Well Containment Company recently announced the readiness of
an initial well containment response system. Work is continuing on additional enhancements to expand the system,
which will be deployed next year. The Marine Well Containment Company membership continues to grow, and now
consists of 10 member companies.

Finally, building on our strong position in Norway, ExxonMobil was awarded three new production licenses as part of
the Norwegian Continental Shelf 21st licensing round. These include one operated production license and two
non-operated licenses.
Moving now to slide 10, in Indonesia, ExxonMobil made another discovery on the Cepu block in East Java province.
The Kedung Keris well was drilled to a total depth of 7,032 feet and encountered an oil column of 561 feet in the target
carbonate zone. The Kedung Keris discovery is located approximately nine miles from the Banyu Urip oil discovery,
which was made in 2001. The Banyu Urip production system continues to perform well, and activities are progressing
on the future 450 million barrel oil field development.
We're also evaluating our coal bed methane acreage in the onshore Barito Basin, which covers approximately 290,000
net acres. Exploration drilling commenced with the first coal bed methane well in early April, and drilling operations
are ongoing.
Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 11, upstream earnings in the first
quarter were $8.7 billion, up $2.9 billion from the first quarter of 2010. Stronger crude oil and natural gas realizations
increased earnings by $2.6 billion, as crude oil realizations increased over $25 per barrel, and gas realizations increased
$0.72 per Kcf. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $160 million, due mainly to the impact of
high prices on entitlement volumes, higher downtime, and decline, partly offset by the ramp up of Qatar projects and
the addition of XTO. Other items, primarily a gain on the sale of Western Canada assets and the absence of prior-year
dry holes, increased earnings by $470 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $20.
Moving to slide 12, oil equivalent volumes increased 10.5% from the first quarter of last year, mainly due to growth in
our U.S. unconventional resource business and the impact of Qatar project ramp-up. Volumes were, however,
negatively impacted by higher prices on entitlement volumes, higher downtime, decline, and divestments.
Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on slide 13, versus the fourth quarter of 2010, upstream earnings
increased by $1.2 billion, with stronger realizations resulting in an additional $1.3 billion in earnings, as crude oil
realizations increased over $16 per barrel and global gas realizations increased $0.79 per Kcf. Production mix and
volume effects decreased earnings by $520 million, due mainly to the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes,
higher downtime, and divestments. Other items, primarily asset management activity and lower operating expenses,
increased earnings by $410 million.
Moving to slide 14, oil equivalent volumes decreased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2010, due mainly to the impact of
higher prices on entitlement volumes, downtime, and divestments. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to
the press release and the IR supplement.
Moving now to the downstream and starting on slide 15; during the quarter ExxonMobil lubricants and specialties
renewed the longstanding technology partnership with the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes Formula 1 team. The new
multiyear agreement maintains the longest continuous oil company sponsorship of a Grand Prix race team. As part of
the agreement, we will continue providing Vodafone McLaren Mercedes with Mobil 1 lubricant technology, expertise,
and support to develop next generation lubricants for their race car engine and gearbox. ExxonMobil will continue to
leverage learnings from the extreme conditions of Formula 1 racing to further enhance Mobil 1 synthetic oil
formulations.
With this agreement, ExxonMobil will also supply a range of specialized lubricant products for use at the McLaren
Technology Center. These products will include high performance cutting fluids used in the manufacturing of race car
components, Mobil SHC synthetic grease for the wind tunnel, and Mobil Delvac 1 synthetic diesel engine oil to help
reduce fuel consumption and improve emissions of the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes truck fleet.
Turning now to the downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 16, downstream earnings in the first
quarter were $1.1 billion, up $1.1 billion from the first quarter of 2010. Improved industry margins increased earnings
by $470 million, driven by higher refining margins, partly offset by lower marketing margins. Continued benefits from
our refining optimization activities contributed $350 million in volume and mix effects, while other factors improved
earnings by $240 million, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange effects.

Moving to slide 17, sequentially, first quarter downstream earnings were essentially flat. Higher industry margins,
partly offset by lower marketing margins, increased earnings by $160 million. Volume and mix effects were a negative
$270 million, primarily due to higher turnaround and maintenance activities. Other factors contributed $60 million.
Turning now to our chemical business, starting on slide 18, ExxonMobil Chemical recently announced the grand
opening of our world-class Shanghai Technology Center in China. Our investment in this new facility demonstrates the
strategic importance of technology and its critical role in supporting the long term value of our chemical business. The
220,000 square foot facility is equipped with more than 200 state-of-the-art processing machines and analytical
instruments. The center also has 22 development scale and 16 commercial scale product processing machines, allowing
us to perform full scale testing to serve our chemical customer needs in the fast growing China and broader Asia
markets. The Shanghai Technology Center is supported by more than 300 employees from our technology, sales and
marketing, and supply chain groups.
Today, the Chinese petrochemical market is the largest in the world. And through 2020, China will represent over
one-third of global petrochemical demand growth. The Shanghai Technology Center is well positioned to support this
growth by providing our customers with product and processing solutions that add value to their businesses.
Turning now to slide 19, during the quarter Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, or SABIC, announced that work on our
proposed joint venture elastomers project has moved into the front end engineering and design phase. As previously
announced, plans are to establish a domestic supply of more than 400,000 tons per year of synthetic rubber, thermal
plastic specialty polymers, and carbon black to serving emerging local and international markets in Asia and the Middle
East.
ExxonMobil and SABIC are targeting development of a globally competitive project with best-in- class industry cost
and have selected Jubail Industrial City as the site for the new manufacturing units in order to expand integration
opportunities within the existing KEMYA petrochemical joint venture. The Saudi elastomers project continues a long
history of investment in Saudi Arabia and builds on the strong relationship with SABIC to meet the growing customer
need for our products.
Turning now to the chemical financial and operating results and starting on slide 20, first quarter chemical earnings
were a record $1.5 billion, up $267 million from the first quarter of 2010, again demonstrating the value of a balanced
portfolio of commodity and specialty businesses, world-scale facilities with strong operational performance, and
technology applications to deliver superior feedstock advantage. Higher margins contributed $470 million in earnings,
primarily driven by stronger commodity chemicals margins and our feedstock advantage. Other effects decreased
earnings by $200 million due to higher planned maintenance costs, unfavorable foreign exchange effects, and the
absence of asset management gains.
Moving to slide 21, sequentially, first quarter chemical earnings increased about $450 million. Margin effects increased
earnings by $340 million, primarily due to stronger global commodity chemicals margins. Other effects increased
earnings by $100 million, due mainly to lower turnaround and maintenance costs this quarter.
Moving to slide 22, while we manage our downstream and chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture
benefits from the unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Looking at our combined downstream and
chemical results, first quarter earnings were $2.6 billion, up $1.3 billion from the first quarter of 2010.
Moving to slide 23, ExxonMobil's first quarter financial and operating performance was strong, and reflects the ability
of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver superior results. We maintain a continuous focus on
operational excellence and improving upon our industry leading safety performance, while continuing with the
disciplined execution of our long-term investment plan.
As we continue to deploy high impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil
remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Gilman with the Benchmark
Company.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: David, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: I wonder if you could comment on what you did in the quarter with respect to the tax rate
increase in the UK. Did you accrue at the higher rate and address that in the context of the overall increase in the
effective tax rate, which one might have suspected from a higher price that E&P earnings were actually a lower
percentage than they were in the fourth quarter? I also had a follow up.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, Mark, that's a good question given some of the other results that are out there. We did
not accrue any impact associated with the increase in taxes in the UK that were recently announced. As you probably
know, for U.S. GAAP purposes, effective changes in tax laws are reflected only on the enactment date; as opposed to
IFRS, where the effect of these changes are reflected for laws enacted or laws that are substantially enacted or
anticipated to have that kind of an effect. So we will reflect the impact of that in our earnings at the time that it's fully
enacted.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. And in terms of the tax rate itself going up to 47% in the quarter despite the fact that the
E&P percentage of income was lower in this quarter than in the fourth quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, if you're looking sequentially, I guess if you're looking at the increase then from the
fourth quarter to the first quarter, where we went from 43% to 47%, the biggest factor in the increase there was some
absence of some favorable tax items that we had in the fourth quarter; as well as we did see a little change in the mix
that added about 1% or so. So we're down quarter on quarter and up sequentially.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. My follow-up relates to Iraq, David, and whether or not you included any production in
the quarter from Iraq. And if you could, indicate what kind of impact that will have in terms of the way you're reporting
your financials.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. If we look at volumes in the first quarter, they were de minimis, given the timing that
we reached the production target that we were looking for. So we will see increased volumes as we head into the
second quarter.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Thank you, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Okay. Thank you, Mark.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: A quick opener, forgive me if you gave this number. But do you have a net debt number for the
end of the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Net debt at the end of the quarter was right at about $15.9 billion.

<Q - Paul Sankey>: How much of that is cash?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'm sorry. That's the actual debt.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: All right.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'm sorry. The cash balance was $13.2 billion. So the difference in those then is about $2.6
billion, $2.7 billion.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Great, thanks; if you could, not count as a question and ask you two here. Firstly on CapEx, in the
U.S., clearly you've had a big jump in U.S. CapEx year over year. You're at just over $2 billion of spending. I was
wondering. Could you just talk a little bit more about that number going forward? And I'm thinking, given your
comments on the Gulf of Mexico, about where that $2 billion breaks down to, and where you expect it to go from here?
Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. If we look at the CapEx increase quarter on quarter in the U.S., that's really all the
addition of XTO and the fact that we didn't report CapEx in the first quarter of last year for them and we've got it this
year. That's the bulk of the U.S. increase that you see in the first quarter.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: But I would imagine that you had a lower level of activity in the Gulf of Mexico, right? And you
would expect that to ramp back up going forward?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, I don't have the exact number, but I would assume the activity in the Gulf was a little
bit less. Certainly, we'll see that increasing in this quarter as we're drilling the Hadrian well. And that well, as I
mentioned, has spudded and is going down. And so yes, we'll see that. So we'll see a little pickup there in the second
quarter.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Then what about for the XTO stuff? I know you've reached the level of rigs, but you've held flat.
Is that the expectation, let's say, for the remainder of 2011?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, that's pretty much. I think you'll see us probably be somewhere in that 65 to 70 rigs
quarter-on-quarter rate, which is about flat with where we've been. Obviously, as we look at that portfolio, we are
optimizing the use of those rigs and making sure that we're obviously hitting the liquids-rich areas to the extent
possible; as well as prioritizing our gas rigs and utilization; and, of course, utilization of fracing crews and other
support services and equipment to make sure that we're maximizing the value of that program. But we're very pleased
with how things are going in the first quarter, and looking forward to a good year.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: And then if we just roll that through the combination of the two things, you've got the rigs at
around the same level. Would you expect the CapEx for those rigs to remain at around the same level, or do you think
cost increases?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I think that's a reasonable expectation as we're looking across the year. That's consistent
with the guidance that we had in the March analyst meeting. But as we look across the year, we would expect costs to
be generally flat. That's what we're seeing now here in the first quarter.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Great. And then I hope it's not too long a question. But when I look at your financial and
operating information, your refining capacity for 2010 is given at 6.25 million barrels a day. And if I look at your
utilization rate in Q1, assuming that's the right number for Q1, 5.18 million of throughput. That's about an 82%
utilization rate. If I remember rightly, 2010 was – I can see from the history was a low year for utilization at 84%, with
quite a lot of turnarounds. My question is, how come utilization is so low? Is it the Japan effect? Is there some other
issue there? And would we expect that to bounce higher for the rest of the year? And I'll leave it there, thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, Paul. That's a good question. We had a couple of factors going on. We did see in the
first quarter, particularly relative to the first quarter of last year, some higher turnaround activity in Europe and across
Asia. And of course, we did see some impact in Japan related to the tragic events there.

I can tell you that all of our facilities in Japan are up and running full bore. We obviously brought those up as quickly
as possible in order to help relieve the product supply disruption effects in Japan, and we're very pleased with how that
effort is going. Utilization in the U.S. is doing well. So again, other than the planned maintenance and turnaround
activities outside of the U.S., things – we're doing pretty well.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay, great. Thanks, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug. How are you?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Can you hear me okay?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I can hear you just fine.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Good stuff; so David, a couple of questions. I'm trying to understand the production movements
in the quarter. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts here, so maybe we'll just highlight some of the ones that
jumped out to us. Asia-Pacific gas seems to be down a fair bit. And I'm guessing production share and contracts
impacted African oil. If you can confirm those two things and maybe talk a little bit about them; but if you can, also
explain what's going on with liquids in Europe. And then I have a follow-up, please.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you look broadly across our volumes, we did see some impacts, as I mentioned in my
prepared remarks, from downtime. And we did see that in the Asia-Pacific gas business. We did have some downtime
in Qatar, and that affected our gas business there. Liquids, of course, you're seeing a big decline relative to the impact
of the high prices on entitlements. And as we mentioned in the chart there, you are seeing some impact of divestments,
the two divestments that we announced, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada, on both liquids and gas; but across the board,
large impacts, of course, some PSE entitlement effects, and then the downtime that we had in a number of places.
I'll also mention, while we're talking about overall volumes, we did have some downtime across West Africa that
lowered our volumes there. And as you know, there was downtime up on the North Slope that affected the Prudhoe Bay
volume. So while we did see the downtime effect in the first quarter, and that's both relative to last year and the fourth
quarter of this year in particular, all of that production is back online. So we would expect to get those impacts back as
well as the earnings in the second quarter.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Broadly, David, can you quantify the absolute impact of what has come back on stream? Or do
you want me to take that offline?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have that number on the top of my head. So yes, we'll take that offline.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. My follow-up is fairly quick, I think. The exploration charges were quite light, it appears,
relative to the run rate from last year. Is that basically a reflection of the success levels you've had? Is spending down?
Is it seasonal? Can you give us some idea of what the trend is there, please? And I'll leave it there, thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, Doug. That one is pretty straightforward. It's just the absence of the dry hole costs
that we had last year, in particular Libya and some of the other places that you're aware of. And then the rest is just
timing. We have a very large exploration program getting underway this year. We've got the Hadrian well going down
now. Turkey will be spudding in the second quarter; so some timing, of course, across the quarters. But the main
quarter-on-quarter impact that you see on exploration expense is the absence of the dry hole costs that we booked last
year.

We'll go next to Doug Terreson with ISI.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: In chemicals, you guys have historically invested when competitive advantages were present
rather than when you had really high cyclical returns. And it has, obviously, served you well over time. But at the same
time, the returns in the U.S. chemicals business are about the highest in the global portfolio, which suggests that
opportunities for value-added investment might be present. And so while I don't think that the guys said too much on
U.S. chemicals at the analyst meeting, I wanted to see if you'd comment on the level of interest in investment in this
business; that is, if there is any, and if so, in what product areas, given the surprising strength in this area.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Doug, as you point out, we do have a long history of investing through the price cycle in
the chemicals business.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Yes.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: And that has served us well, and is, of course, serving us well now. And we would expect
it to do the same in the future as we bring the Singapore plant up. When we look in the U.S., we are currently enjoying
a terrific feedstock advantage. Basically, as you know, everybody is running everything to the extent that they can into
the crackers.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Sure.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: And we're taking advantage of that. As we look longer term in the U.S. chemical business,
the first place you've got to start is demand and demand growth for the products. And we don't see the demand in the
U.S. being near as strong as opportunities that we have elsewhere, particularly the Asia-Pacific region and in particular
serving the markets there, and of course, in the Middle East. So I think the growth prospects for demand pull is
definitely outside of the U.S.
And then if we look at where we are today, we're happy with our portfolio and the integration that we have with our
other refineries, and that we've talked about in the past. So while times are real good now and we're taking advantage of
them, we're really focusing the bulk of our investment plan and our growth prospects outside of the U.S.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay, simple enough. And also, given the geographical scope of your operations, your
information on oil demand trends are usually as good or better than anybody's. And on this point, while most of the rise
in oil prices unfolded in the latter part of the first quarter, and there are lag effects in many countries, meaning it may
be too early to know, I wanted to see if you would comment on trends in OECD and non-OECD demand; that is, if you
have updated information from these regions?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have any really updated demand...
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: ...relative to the broad things that we talked about in our energy outlook. I think things are
pretty consistent with that. As I mentioned, of course, we are seeing some inflationary pressures in the developing
countries.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Sure.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: The impact that that might have near term on demand relative to economic growth remains
to be seen. But as we look out long term, we expect to see growth consistent with our energy outlook, but no real

We'll take our next question from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Yes, good morning and thanks for the cash flow statement in the presentation, very helpful.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: You're welcome, Ed.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Just a quick question on chemicals in the international markets. Obviously, there are meant to
be some startups coming on this year. And obviously, oil prices have pushed up, and that may impact demand. What
are happening to the – because that's a lot of the surprise, the chemical margins that you start into this quarter or your
outlook for the rest of the year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Ed, as we're looking – let's start with what we saw in the first quarter, which was very
strong margins across the board, in particular in commodities in the U.S. and Europe. Of course, those were levered up
by our feedstock flexibility and the advantages we have there, so we had a real strong quarter; specialties as well, given
the increase in economic activity and industrial demand, so hitting on all cylinders there in the first quarter.
As we look into the future, it would be very difficult for me to predict or speculate on margins going forward. A lot of
that is driven by economic activity and what's going on. Margins are firm as we look around what's going on today. But
again, given the impact that the economy and changes can have on growth and fairly quickly on prices, I wouldn't want
to speculate. But I would say that one of the important things about taking advantage of what you get is to have your
operations that are up and running, and we're focusing on that. We have very good, high utilizations, and so margins
remain strong. We'll certainly take advantage of it and maximize fee flexibility. But overall prices and demands, that
would be tough for me to look out the window and speculate on that.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And then my follow-up is on this volume/mix shift as we go quarter to quarter. Obviously, in
Q4 you had an $870 million gain versus Q3. And then this quarter you lost $520 million. And you mentioned PSEs and
downtime. Is it right for us to assume that most of that is downtime in terms of that vol/mix impact?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Ed, if you're looking quarter on quarter, one of the biggest impacts there is entitlements
had a big impact. And again, as I mentioned, downtime was the other. And that really hit our liquids. So what you see
quarter on quarter sequentially is liquids volumes went down because of those effects, and gas volumes went up. And
at current prices, we're not making the same money on the U.S. gas business as we are on our liquids.
So as I mentioned earlier, all of the downtime is back up and running, and we're pleased to have those volumes back.
Crude oil prices remain strong. So to the extent that that continues to have impacts on entitlements, we'll see those
going forward. But I think when you look at what we control, it's good to have the downtime behind us and the
volumes back online.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And to follow on from Mark's question, do you have a number for the UK tax charge at this
point in terms of the charge you might take in Q3?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have that number yet. We'll have that, obviously – if that goes through, we'll have
that in the second quarter.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Faisel.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on the asset management effects of – I think
it was $410 million or so in the upstream business sequentially. What exactly is – can you talk about asset
management? What does that exactly mean?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, and asset management is only one factor in that $410 million. You're basically seeing
in there the impact of the Western Canada sale that we had in the first quarter of this year. But that was mostly offset by
the gain on the sale of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico last quarter. So if we look at that $410 million quarter to quarter
sequentially, the biggest impact in there is on lower operating expenses. So you have a combination of lower field
expense; and then as the question was mentioned earlier, lower exploration expense quarter on quarter because of the
effects I mentioned. So the big impact in that $410 million sequentially is really lower operating expense.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, got you, and one last question. On the chemical business, if I'm looking at U.S. chemical
prime product sales, if I go back and look at those volumes over the last few quarters, it looks like you peaked out at
about 2.6 million tons in the third quarter of last year. But you're still operating on this 2.2 million ton range. Is there
something going on with some of the assets that you're selling less product than you did in the third quarter of last
year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, there's really nothing going on from an asset perspective. We had a little higher
turnaround activity in the fourth quarter. One of the effects that you see, for example, when you compare our first
quarter volumes in '11 compared to the first quarter volume of last year, we did have an opportunity. You might recall,
this time last year I mentioned that a number of our competitors' units were down for various reasons, and we had an
opportunity to really pick up some spot sales, particularly in the U.S. in the commodity business, and took advantage of
that. And so that was being pretty opportunistic.
As we look across the quarters balancing things out and taking into account maintenance timing and that sort of thing,
no real change. In fact, I'll tell you from a utilization standpoint, we're running our facilities at a rate that's above the
industry averages that have been announced. Uptime has been great. And I think I said a minute ago, that business is
hitting on all cylinders right now, and we're very pleased with the financial results.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.

Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Hi, good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Blake.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: A question for you; I know you addressed the asset sales in Western Canada and the Gulf of
Mexico. But when you look just in general, the asset divestitures have ticked higher here over the last couple of
quarters compared to where we were trending previously, and I'm just curious. Is that a sign of increased divestiture
activity to come?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, I wouldn't read anything into that particularly. As you know, we have a longstanding
practice and a longstanding program. I think we mentioned at the March Analyst Meeting that if you two back to the

merger, we've divested about $40 billion worth of assets. That's a pretty big program. It's opportunistic. It's ongoing.
Obviously, you'll have the timing of certain things, but nothing major, nothing out of the ordinary; always evaluating
opportunities; always talking to folks that are interested in our assets. And as we've said before, if someone comes
along and places a higher value, for whatever reason, on an asset than we do, we're certainly going to talk to them about
that opportunity. But I wouldn't look at the recent trend as any sign or indicator of increased or lower activity levels to
come.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay, thanks, and then one follow-up, if I could, just on the share repurchases. I may not get
very far on this, but I'll give it a stab anyway. I guess I was thinking maybe there's a chance that repurchase program
would have bumped up a bit heading into 2Q, just given the elevated commodity environment and the fact that the cash
balance is back up to $13 billion. Would you say there's maybe an upward bias should commodity prices stay where
they are here?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I wouldn't necessarily say there's any bias with respect to the share purchases. We did have
very strong cash flows in the first quarter for the reasons I mentioned. That did enable us to really follow the cash
strategy that we've talked about many times. We have a very large investment program this year. I hope everybody
noticed the announcement yesterday of our fairly sizable dividend increase. So we are pleased to be able to fund that
and then have the ability to fund another $5 billion of share repurchases, while at the same time maintaining our strong
balance sheet; and most importantly, maintaining financial flexibility. Of course, as we talk about a lot, maintaining
discipline in investment and uses of cash throughout the cycle is one of our key objectives, and we continue to manage
the business along those lines.

We'll go next to Iain Reid with Jefferies.
<Q - Iain S. Reid MBA>: Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning.
<Q - Iain S. Reid MBA>: I'd like to echo the thanks for the cash flow statements. I'm looking forward to the balance
sheet next quarter.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: It will be out shortly.
<Q - Iain S. Reid MBA>: Yes, yes, I know, just a couple questions. Going back to Iraq, the industry gossip is that
things are tougher than people expected in Iraq in terms of production buildup. There's a fair amount of infrastructure
to be – I think you're response for the water injection system. Can you talk about what you think these volumes might
rise to over the balance of this year and going into the next couple of years; and also how we should think about what
your booked production is going to look like out of that?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, let me hit the second question first and then move back to the first one.
If we look at our production and the increases that we've got and are achieving, they're right on schedule. They're right
on plan. We're not seeing any real constraints moving up to 320,000 barrels per day. And so from that standpoint, we're
pleased and look forward to continuing progress. As I mentioned from a production booking standpoint, very low in the
first quarter because of the timing of hitting that target, and you'll see that ramp up here a bit over the second quarter.
We've got three rigs running now. We've got more rigs coming, workovers, facilities, optimization, so all of that stuff is
up and running.
Now, as we go down the road, not only ourselves but the rest of the industry, there are infrastructure needs to be
addressed, one of which on the water injection side, ExxonMobil is leading that study, and that progresses. There are
also needs for additional export capacity and facilities to move the oil out of the country, and those are being addressed

as well. But both of those are large scale efforts that need to be undertaken. But it's too early for me to predict either the
timing or the ultimate potential because there will be a number of factors that affect that. But I think your observation is
spot on. Things are going very well right now. And we've got some infrastructure issues to address in the coming
months and years.
<Q - Iain S. Reid MBA>: Okay, and can I ask? Last quarter, you gave us a number for XTO's earnings per barrel that
was distinct from the rest of the portfolio. Can you update us on that for this quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I wasn't planning on giving any XTO specific earnings numbers. We've got that all
wrapped up in our U.S. results that you've seen reported and would continue to do that.
I would offer, though, as we look at that unconventional business now through the end of the first quarter, we are very
pleased with the progress we're making on integration. We're especially pleased with the synergistic results that we're
starting to see, the fruition coming to bear of our efforts, both on the addition of XTO resources to our global
unconventional program. We've got folks working on planning of our efforts there. We have drilled some wells. We've
got others planned. And we are certainly benefiting from the expertise that they bring to the table.
Likewise, here in the U.S., we're really starting to see the benefit of combining some of heritage ExxonMobil's
technology capabilities and research capability and some of the technologies that we developed in the tight gas realm
being applied to the XTO business. And I don't have any numbers to quote today but I can tell you directionally, if you
look at the objectives we have of improving capital efficiency, improving productivity, and lowering operating costs,
we are making good progress and are very pleased with how that's going. So the story there remains very positive. And
we look forward to the upcoming quarters and years to, again, really get out of that resource what we have planned.

We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: David, when I'm looking at your European gas output in the first quarter, it was 4.8 Bcf versus
the first quarter of 2010 is 5.1 Bcf. It's a little bit surprising that you dropped that much given the first quarter 2011
weather was pretty cold and the pricing was strong. So we would expect that over a couple of years to max out your gas
output because the demand is there. So does that mean that year over year, we are dropping by say around 8% on the –
upper 7% on the underlying decline curve on your European gas capacity, or that the first quarter 2010 is just maybe
some one-off accounting issue that the number is high?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Paul, that is an excellent question. And interestingly enough, even though European
demand was high in the first quarter of '11, it was actually less than the first quarter of '10, and really accounted for at
least half, if not a little more, of the decrease you saw quarter on quarter, with the balance basically being decline. But
yes, we did see an overall demand drop relative to the first quarter of last year.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Interesting, I would have thought that the demand – so the underlying decline is more like in the
3% to 4%? It's not the 7%?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, I didn't do that calculation. But yes, if you're looking overall at the decline, figure
about half of that is demand and the other half is decline.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Dave, you were talking about Iraq earlier. Can you tell us how the accounting worked in
terms of reporting the production and earnings now that you are above 10%? So does that mean that – is the production
in excess of the baseline, then you just report your 65% share? Or how exactly is the accounting in terms of reporting

the production and the earnings going to be?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, Paul. As you know, those contracts in Iraq are unique. They do exhibit some
elements that look like a PSE in terms of cost recovery. You do have, of course, then the remuneration, the fee that you
get above the 10%. And then, of course, the actual volumes that you book are impacted by prices as well. So as we
move forward, we'll be booking production just as the way we've said those contracts work. We'll get the volumes for
cost recovery, and then we'll get the volumes associated with the remuneration fee. And then we'll book the reserves
accordingly as well.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So you're basically will book similar, like what you did in the PSE. So you have your – let's say
you spend $100 million in the course, and then your fee, let's say for argument's sake, is going be $10 million. So you
would book – your production will be equal to whatever – let's say if it's $100 oil, then you book 1.1 million barrels in
production. Is that the way that you're going to do?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Directionally, Paul, I think the math flows the way you're suggesting. I'm sure there's a few
nuances. But directionally speaking, that's how that's going to work.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay, if I can sneak in just a quick one?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: You're not going to talk about the XTO contribution. Can you tell us what is the XTO asset oil
and gas production for the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, we really, again, heading into this year, now that we've fully integrated that business
into the rest of the U.S. results, we weren't planning to break out either earnings or absolute production levels. But of
course, if you look at the net growth year over year that we show in the volumes chart, the bulk of that is XTO. So
again, I'll give you an indicator. We drilled, I think, 900 and some wells in XTO last year, and we've already drilled 200
in the first quarter of this year. So again, the business is doing well. It's now going to be reported and fully integrated in
with the rest of our U.S. results.

Our next question comes from Katherine Minyard with JPMorgan.
<Q - Katherine Lucas Minyard CFA, MBA>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning.
<Q - Katherine Lucas Minyard CFA, MBA>: Just a couple of quick questions on the entitlement sensitivity both
quarter over quarter and year over year. In your slide where you compare year over year, you've got about a 65,000
barrel a day change. And I've got about a $28 change in the Brent oil price. So that's about 2,300 barrels a day per
$1.00 change in oil. Then if I look at the quarter over quarter, it looks to be about a 5,000 barrel a day change per $1.00
per barrel oil price change. So I was curious as to what the ratable sensitivity is on a go-forward basis, and whether
there was any one-off impact in the most recent quarter or over the course of the last year that would be skewing that.
Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, Katherine. That's an excellent question. The biggest factor we have in the sequential
quarter, more so than in the quarter on quarter, is really in the price and spend effect. And the thing you have to keep in
mind is both price and spend impact that. And so what we saw was we had higher prices quarter to quarter from the
fourth quarter to the first quarter and much lower spending. So you've got a double whammy there of lower spending
and higher prices, significantly lowering the volumes that you get.

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: On a go-forward basis, I really couldn't give you a number because again, I don't know
what crude oil prices are going to do. Directionally, our spend levels tend to increase across the year, particularly
relative fourth quarter to first quarter. You tend to see higher spending in the fourth quarter and lower spending in the
first quarter, and we've seen that effect. So I really wouldn't have a number going forward other than to say the biggest
impact on us is going to be the level of spending and then, of course, what crude oil prices do.

We'll go next to Allen Good with Morningstar.
<Q - Allen Good>: Good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Allen.
<Q - Allen Good>: Just a quick question. Can you give an update on Golden Pass and what kind of activity you're
seeing down there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. I'd be happy to give you an overall update on that project. Things are going quite
well. As you know, we are commissioning that in two phases. We've got the first phase done. That commission cargo
actually arrived, the first one, in the fourth quarter of last year. We brought in five additional cargoes. We got that thing
up and running. Actually, we exported some gas into the pipeline and all the facilities are working.
As we sit here today, Phase 2 is complete and in the commissioning stage, and we brought in a cargo for that. So we
continue on the full commissioning and startup of that terminal. And as you know, that's part of a broader strategy out
of Qatar to have a footprint and all the regas footprint in all the major markets and have left about a third of our
volumes out of Qatar to be available to the spot market. And as the strategy was unfolded, the ability to divert those
cargoes to get the highest net back is exactly what we're seeing today. And so we're taking all available cargoes into
Europe, where we enjoy a nice spread there, as well as demand in the Asia-Pac market for spot cargoes in addition to
our term contracts is also strong. So we're very pleased with how all these facilities are coming along, and especially
pleased with the performance of our balance and mix of commercial arrangements.
<Q - Allen Good>: Thanks for those comments on the LNG market, just one more follow-up. On the downstream
earnings for international, there was a drop-off there from 4Q to this first quarter. I just want to confirm that that was
due to the turnarounds that you mentioned earlier throughout Europe and Asia. And I wanted to confirm that most of
those facilities are back online and producing at full capacity.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, you're right. The primary impact was the turnaround and maintenance related
activities. And as we're looking today – and that was across Europe and Asia-Pacific. And where we're sitting here
today, those facilities are back up and running, and came out of a very successful maintenance period.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay, and any more anticipated turnarounds, either in Europe or the U.S. for the remainder of the
year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have a turnaround schedule. But I think you'll see normal turnaround maintenance
activities in the U.S. here in the second quarter, consistent with what we normally do and what industry normally does.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay, I appreciate it very much.

We'll go next to Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Thanks for taking my question, a broad question, if I may. It has been almost a year, of
course, since XTO closed, and I'm curious. How have the company's unconventional gas plans evolved for your
overseas acreage, in particular if any of the drilling timetables have changed?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I wouldn't say any of the drilling timetables have changed. Nonetheless, we do have a very
active program underway, both coming out of 2010 as well as into 2011. For example, if you look at the Poland
resources, we've been actively acquiring 3D seismic. We did get a well down in one of our licenses in the first quarter. I
think it finished up in February. We've got a second well that spud in February. So we're starting to do our evaluation
program, our drilling program, and would expect to continue to do that as the year goes on.
If you look at Germany, there again, we have continued our evaluation efforts there and our drilling some additional
wells, and we expect that program to continue on. But again, things are going about as we had planned both in the shale
gas in Germany as well as in coal bed methane. We are getting wells down and are evaluating those results. That will
determine the pace and extent of our program going forward. But we continue to view those opportunities very highly.
I'll tell you another area for us outside of the country is Argentina, where we have also acquired a fairly large acreage
position there. And we are doing evaluation and preparations to commence drilling there later on.
So if I step back and look at our total global unconventional portfolio, we've continued to add to our acreage positions.
We are continuing to pursue additional acreage positions. And again, as I mentioned a little earlier, really leveraging
the capabilities of ExxonMobil and XTO to both evaluate those prospects; and to the extent that any of them prove to
be commercial, move into the development program. So about as planned, but certainly a higher level of activity
recently than a couple of years ago.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: I appreciate the color on that. And then just real quick, any changes at PNG LNG on either
startup, timing of startup or CapEx estimates?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, I don't have any updated information. That project is on plan and doing fine. And we
continue to project that we're going to deliver first LNG out of there some time in 2014, so that project is going well.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: All right, thanks very much.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you very much. We probably have time for one last question.

The final question comes from Mark Gilman with Benchmark Company.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: David, what specifically was the gain on the Western Canada asset sale in the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Mark, as I typically do or don't do, I really don't have a number specifically for any one
asset sale on the quarter.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay, let me try just other one in light of that. Was there any lifting variance at all in this
quarter, David, that could have impacted the upstream side, sales less than or greater than the underlying level of
production?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: As we look quarter on quarter, sequentially, I don't recall there being any impact.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay, thanks very much.
