press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on
the call include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and
presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.
On the call today are Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil
& Gas and we have a number of senior team members in the room with us today.
I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be using the slide
presentation to review our performance and outlook. After our comments, we'll open the call for questions.
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $510 million or $0.49 per share for the first quarter
of 2014, which compared with $648 million or $0.68 per share for the first quarter of 2013. Our first quarter results
were negatively impacted by lower sales from Indonesia attributable to the regulatory ban on concentrates imposed in
mid-January and to lower copper prices.
We benefited from strong operating performance from the oil and gas business and from our Americas and Africa
mining operations, which partly offset the unfavorable impact. The consolidated first quarter copper sales of 0.9 billion
pounds were about 9% below last year's first quarter, primarily as a result of the deferral exports from Indonesia which
reduced or deferred our copper and gold sales by approximately 125 million pounds of copper and 140,000 ounces of
gold. We are actively engaged in discussions with the Indonesian government to work to resume exports as soon as
possible.
Our first quarter sales of oil and natural gas totaled 16.1 million barrels of oil equivalents, which was above our recent
forecast. The first quarter average recorded copper price of $3.14 per pound was below last year's first quarter of $3.51
and gold prices of $1,300 per ounce were 19% below the year ago quarter.
Oil prices remained strong during the quarter with Brent prices averaging about $108 per barrel, the average realization
by our oil and gas division was $99 per barrel before the impacts of derivative contracts. During the quarter, we
generated operating cash flows of $1.2 billion that was net of about $400 million in working capital uses, and our
capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $1.6 billion. We ended the quarter with a total debt of $20.9 billion and our
consolidated cash position was $1.4 billion.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the presentation materials.
Richard C. Adkerson
Thanks, Kathleen, good morning, everyone. Looking at page three, you can see the cover of our new annual report,
which we're just now beginning to distribute. It's got a band of a depiction of our resources like a rising sun coming
over the earth, which I think is a good way of thinking about our company. We have this great long-lived geographical
diverse set of assets. At today's commodity prices, you'll see that across our set of assets, we have really strong margins
in both our mining and oil and gas business and that generates good cash flows. We have, of course, exposure to what
we will believe will be improving markets for commodities over time.
And in addition to that, we have the opportunity to grow volumes through our production profile. We've got good
strong exploration leverage both in the mining business through our brownfield expansions and in the oil and gas
business where we have brownfield type of growth opportunities from exploration, as well as greenfield in the
deepwater and in our gas exploration play, we'll be talking about that. Our company's financially strong and we got a
great team, we do things in the right way, we're experienced, we manage our environmental responsibilities and our
community responsibilities in the right way.
All through 2013 and going into 2014, our code word for our company has been execution. We have assets that we can
benefit from if we execute our plans well and we have another quarter where we've done that. We had solid

performance in our mining operations in the Americas and Africa. We're going to talk about the restrictions that we
have currently on our sales from PT Freeport Indonesia because of these government export regulations, but we
benefited from a very meaningful contribution from the oil & gas business.
This is our third full quarter of operations after closing the transaction in June of last year. And the oil & gas business
had strong operating and financial performance during the quarter. We also will report that we've advanced our growth
projects, the Morenci expansion expected commissioning/startups in this current quarter. The Cerro Verde expansion
construction is well in progress towards a 2016 startup. The Lucius development, deepwater Gulf of Mexico project has
its first oil expected to be produced in the second half of this year. And then we have very positive results from the
exploratory results at our Highlander prospect in offshore in South Louisiana that Jim will be talking about.
Financially, our financial results were affected, of course, by the, what we're going to call, deferral of volumes as a
result of this pending resolution of the Indonesian export situation that reduced our volumes in the first quarter by about
125 million pounds of copper and 140,000 ounces of gold.
So other than that, if you look at our actual volumes for the quarter, we were on target with the guidance that we gave
you at our last quarterly outlook. So, we have a situation where we're affected by that, we're going to talk about it, but
other than that operation performance in terms of volumes produced and cost structure was really, really attractive.
The situation that we have now in Indonesia is because of the government regulations that were adopted on January 12.
We have had no export shipments from PT Freeport Indonesia. We are able to ship concentrate to the smelter in
Indonesia that our company arranged to be constructed back in the 1990s. It's operated by a company called PT
Smelting, which is, we have a 25% equity interest in PT Smelting. The operator of the smelter is Mitsubishi. So, we
have adjusted our production of concentrate to align the volumes of concentrate that we're producing with the
requirements that can be processed at PT Smelting. That results in our mill operating at roughly half capacity, and of
course the inability to sell concentrates at full capacity does have negative financial impacts, not only to our company
but to the government of Indonesia through reduced taxes, royalties, and ultimately, dividends from that. What we're
doing operationally is we are putting priority on the operation of our DOZ underground mine, the block caving
operation, since that operation needs to continue to operate to preserve the caving activities that are part of it. We're
mining lower grade material and focusing on stripping in the Grasberg open pit. We're also doing maintenance
activities so that we will be prepared to return to full operations when the government regulatory situation is resolved.
To date, we have not made significant cuts in employment. We have not had significant deferrals of our ongoing major
capital projects, which are important as we look at a transition from the open pit mine at Grasberg to mining
underground at the Grasberg block cave beneath the pit, which we're looking at roughly at the end of 2016, 2017. So
essentially where we have today, and you see reflected in our financial results, also reflected in the benefits that the
government gets, is maintaining basically 100% of our cost structure, but having sales at 50% or lower than the issue.
We're working with the government to achieve a resolution for this. The government ministries are focused and appear
to be making progress towards reaching a resolution of it. Indonesia had last week a major election of its national
Parliament and also local bodies. It was a massive undertaking in that election situation took the focus away from many
people in government from resolving our issue. It's also created a political context in which resolution of some of these
issues is complicated but that election is behind us. There's a presidential election in early July. We know that the
government is focused on getting a resolution and we're working to encourage them.
One of the complications is that we're viewing this issue in the context of our Contract of Work. Our Contract of Work
was signed in 1991, it defines our financial obligations and our operating rights there. Many in government are
focusing on the 2009 mining law, which represented a change going forward in Indonesia from a Contract of Work
environment to more of an operating license situation. The government is looking to move COW [Contract of Work]
holders more to the mining law requirements and that's part of the complications we're having in how to deal with this
issue.
We have reached out to the government to try to be responsive to some of their aspirations. We have indicated a
willingness to develop additional smelter capacity in Indonesia in the form of where the government would provide us

certain financial incentives because the economics of building a new smelter are really unattractive, given global
smelter economics.
We're talking with potential partners including ANTAM, the state-owned mining company there in terms of working
with us in this project. When you see our outlook numbers that Kathleen referred to, that's based on a resumption of
beginning operations in May and we're optimistic about doing that, but we – that is dependent on the government
moving forward to change its regulations, because currently under the regulations, we don't have the authority to
export, so we need to have this authority granted, and then we'll deal with the regulations that are adopted in giving us
that authority. If we are delayed any further, the deferral would result in a – at a rate of about 50 million pounds of
copper a month and 80,000 ounces of gold.
Our numbers reflect, beginning to operate in May that we're going to be sharing with you or that we shared with you in
this release. While we don't think, this will continue for a long period of time, in the event that it does, we could operate
as we are now physically, but economically, a continuation of this over a long period of time would require us to take
actions to reduce costs, that means layoffs and defer capital expenditures. That's not really good for anyone, and
particularly we have a particular concern about the impact of that on our workforce of having layoffs and on our
long-term ability to realize the benefits of this ore body, both for our company and the government of Indonesia and the
local community. So there will be nothing good from laying off people or deferring projects, and that's why we
deferred doing this to this point, but we would be required to do that if this goes for a long period of time.
Page 7, just reference how positive our work with the government of Indonesia – at PT Freeport Indonesia's been over
the last 40 years. Since our contract was signed in 1991, we've contributed $60 billion to the national GDP, we're over
90% of the economy in the region where we operate, over 40% of the province's economy and a significant contributor
to the national GNP. We have a workforce that includes employees and full-time contractors of 30,000 people. We're
one of the largest taxpayers in Indonesia. As I mentioned, we were the developer of Indonesia's only copper smelter
there, it produces more copper than Indonesia as a country consumes, and we've invested to-date over $10 billion.
As we move underground, we have a business plan that provides for additional investments of over $15 billion. We
contribute significantly to the local community, including a voluntary contribution of 1% of our revenues that has
provided over $600 million since that one was started in 1996, that's an enormous social program for a relatively small
population group. And we remain committed to being a positive partner with the government and with all stakeholders
in Indonesia. Over the last five years, we've paid over $7 billion of direct benefits that is more than has been paid to
Freeport-McMoRan as a major shareholder of this operation.
Turning to copper markets, we saw in March a downturn in the market in the copper price, it's rebounded some since
then. There was a lot of concern when the downturn occurred about growth in China, about the existence of a
significant amount of copper in all exchange-bonded warehouses in China and whether that might come to the
marketplace in a context of relatively low global growth. What we see though in terms of the business we're doing there
now and with what the market seems to be is a situation of not where the copper market is being flooded by a large
amount of new supplies. We're not seeing a situation of where fundamental demand has dropped off any cliff. The
market reaction is more dealing with issues at the margin place.
The fundamental demand in China remains healthy, it's supported by consumer and infrastructure investment. The
Chinese government has talked about incentives, relatively modest, but important ones in the areas where copper is
consumed. The lower price has reduced the availability of scrap and that creates more demand for copper cathodes.
Market reports that some of the bonded warehouse stocks are now being purchased by China as strategic reserve.
There's different views of how much that is. But it is an indication I think that these volumes in bonded warehouses are
not going to be dumped onto the market in any place.
Demand in the U.S. where we provide over 40% of the copper wire is improving, our downstream customers are doing
well, consumer confidence is growing, automobile and construction continues to be positive. We have a smelter in
Europe and we're seeing an uptick in Europe from its low base, but globally, copper cathode markets are tight.
Exchange and consumer stocks are at historically low levels, scrap availability is tight and premiums for our copper
cathode are strengthening globally.

And if we look into the future, we continue to be encouraged by the basic fundamentals of a commodity which its use
is inherently positive in terms of development in developing countries as well as uses in the economy in general, and
where development of supplies and maintaining production in existing mines is challenged.
Page 9 looks at our cost structure and this when you look, when Jim reviews the oil & gas operations, you'll see what
strong margins we have there, but this margin story applies to our copper business as well. Our first quarter, our
consolidated unit costs net of by-product credits was just over $1.50 a pound, that gives us a good margin at $3 copper,
and of course, we are positive about copper prices moving forward.
You can see how that breaks down by areas, and outside of the situation in Indonesia, you can see our cost performance
has been strong. Red's [Red Conger] team in the Americas is doing a great job, our African project is doing well. And
you can see that in our distribution of our copper sales between North America, South America, and Indonesia and
Africa gives us a good diversity in our copper business and that's aided by our investments in the oil & gas business.
Our brownfield development projects are proceeding well. Cerro Verde is the big project, it's $4.6 billion current
estimate. We started construction a little over a year ago, and we're on target to complete it in 2016 to add 600 million
pounds of copper per year. We've incurred just under $2 billion to-date. This will be the world's largest single site
concentrating milling facility. And to see ground work being completed, physical construction started. This is a site
where construction can be undertaken on a relatively low-risk basis, because it's at an existing site where we were
already operating.
Morenci is really exciting. This $1.6 billion project is being completed, commissioning startup expected to occur this
quarter at 225 million pounds of copper, $1.3 billion we've incurred to-date. What's so really great about Morenci is,
this is a mine that people thought 10 years ago was dead and now we've got this expansion project, we're making a lot
of money there, with what we already have. And we have a place where our exploration team is working hand-in-hand
with our development group to give us the next stage, which could be a very large scale expansion there and making
Morenci one of the largest most profitable mines in the world. So it's a real excitement for this to happen here at the
flagship mine in North America for the industry and our team's very enthusiastic about it.
And when you look at our copper potential around the world, with what's going on with Morenci, what we have at
Grasberg, what we're doing at Cerro Verde, the opportunity at El Abra in Chile to have a potential for a massive
concentrator development project there. And with Tenke, which is this massive mineralization area, we have the chance
to have in our portfolio five of the very largest mines in the world, and that's what we're working towards.
I'll come back and talk about the outlook, but, Jim, turn it over to you and let you talk about our oil & gas business and
congratulations on such a great quarter for you and your team.
James C. Flores
Great, Richard. Thank you. Welcome everybody to the call. This morning, I want to start on page 12 and go through
the Brent, LLS crude oil pricing relationship and kind of how it affects our business, and how well positioned our
business really is. When you see the curve there with the green and orange on our slide 12, you can see that's very
consistent through the past 10 years except for right at the end, we saw a little pressure on the LLS side divergent from
the Brent, that's we believe that's a one-time type event with the opening of the southern leg of Keystone, we saw the
tremendous crude oil inventories exiting Cushing and going down the Gulf Coast namely St. James. Refiners obviously
took advantage of that and doubled down by having a significant amount of turnarounds and therefore, you had some
downward pressure there on margins that affected a lot of margins of all upstream businesses.
I'll refer you to the black box down below where can see what FM O&G's realizations per barrel before hedges are, and
you can see in June 2013, $97 a barrel. Obviously, we had a fabulous quarter in the third quarter of 2013, $106, $94,
$100, these are basically reflecting that same curve volatility as well as those basis differentials. But in the first quarter
of 2014 to have a $99 differential when you have that type of blowout in basis, just shows you the resilience and
positioning of our assets, also the quality of the oil that we're producing.

When we talk about HLS, LLS, and Brent, we produce a significant amount of HLS crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico,
heavy Louisiana sweet, which basically trades at a premium to LLS. Therefore, when you see a basis differential
created here like on page 12 between Brent and LLS, we are actually in excellent position to continue to sell our oil at
the highest prices and therefore reflect that $99 a barrel differential. One more thing operationally there is, we continue
to produce more crude oil versus natural gas, or liquids, or condensate, and with that crude oil margin so strong in the
upper 80s, then we're able to obviously continue to expand that margin instead of contracting to offset these market
conditions. The market has since rebounded, LLS and Brent is now trading closer in parity, and we're taking advantage
of that obviously with our ongoing operations.
Page 13, with our oil and gas assets gives you kind of a snapshot of our four major producing areas. California, the
steady producer, has continued to generate very strong returns for our invested capital and supports underlying
consistency of our $900 million of operating cash margin we had in the first quarter of about $59 a barrel margin,
almost $60.
Eagle Ford, we continue to have outperformance there beyond our initial curves, on our type curves for reserves and
production, but an excellent job of managing our completion inventory and continue to outperform in the Eagle Ford,
and do a very good job of extracting the resources there.
Our Haynesville is a significant gas resource, we continue to keep that incubated as we develop our Inboard Lower
Tertiary Cretaceous gas play. We thought it's going to be a balancing act between that reservoir and the large flows
we'll have coming out of our South Louisiana asset base, but the Haynesville continues to be a significant gas reserve,
And when our margins move up 90% due to a 25%, 30% increase in gas prices, it certainly feels a lot better to be in the
Haynesville than in years past.
Then on to the beast, the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, we are continuing to outpace our production goals through
superior production management and reservoir management. We have offset any projected natural declines with those
activities and have actually drilled our first well in deepwater after our acquisition of the Gulf of Mexico assets back in
the fall of 2013. Man, it feels like a decade ago, doesn't it, Richard?
And so, the first well, the A16 well off our Holstein platform, we found 60 feet of gorgeous 30% porosity box spar pay
that we're going to be bringing on here in the next month and we'll be talking about that well as we flow. But as, it's
always good to, when you've got a long-term campaign to try to bring on eight to 10 of these type projects a year, about
40,000 barrels to 50,000 barrels of oil a day for the next six years in our development plan just on those assets, each
year, that's always great to get off to a good start. It's like a good drive in the first round of Augusta, so it feels good
getting off the number one tee box.
So all's good on the operating side and the strong cash margin that Richard was talking about is well intact and we're
looking forward to it from an operating standpoint. The cash margin is detailed here on page 14. You've got California,
Eagle Ford's gas assets and Haynesville/Madden and Other, our GOM and the consolidated when you get to the $58.71.
You can see the strong emphasis in the Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford with our strong LLS pricing they were our
top performers there, and as well as our niche in the large increase that we had on a margin basis in Haynesville due to
the gas prices, and then California, has continued to be steady around $55 a barrel.
Moving on to page 15. We were very successful in the 2014 Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. We outlaid $330
million of total high bids. We're waiting for those bids to be awarded. It does cover 20 blocks, and over 106,000 gross
acres. Our net unrisked resource potential of 1.1 billion barrels associated with these new acreage is very important
added to our inventory. But it's the continued execution of the strategy we had, as we acquired these assets, we wanted
to core up all these tieback opportunities to our facilities and give us our infrastructure leverage. Remember in 2013,
we were very active around the Holstein area in Green Canyon buying leases, like we bought 16 in 2013. The majority
of these leases in 2014 were around the Mississippi Canyon, Viosca Knoll area around our Marlin, Horn Mountain and
Ram Powell facilities. This puts us in position to have those type development activities I talked about by bringing that
production forward through 2020 and helping drive our total production volumes in 2020 up to about 110 million
barrels a year versus where we are today at about 64 million barrels a year. So this business is intact, we have the real

estate, and like Richard talked about, it's execute, execute, execute and I'm very excited about having this opportunity.
Just to refresh everybody on page 16 are those three large facilities and we're producing about 65,000 barrels a day total
right now, which is consistent where we've been and that's us talking about the production management of offsetting
newly projected declines. We have about 250,000 barrels a day or we're at 75% of unutilized capacity going forward.
So to be in a unique position to have the resources under our control, under our budget and have the infrastructure in
place where we can actually execute this plan in the Gulf of Mexico without capital outlays for facilities and things of
that nature is very unique, and we're finally positioned to do that assuming all of the leases get awarded to us here this
summer.
Looking forward, on the near-term production growth side, our Lucius Deepwater development's on time, on schedule.
Our operator Anadarko is doing a fantastic job there, and there's always a few bumps and bruises, they make it look
easy, and we really appreciate that. But we're on schedule here, hopefully third quarter now, as we're finally bringing
the world-class reservoir on and deliverability and being impactful to our company going forward very soon.
So, on the oil and gas front, in the deepwater, everything's moving forward. We have a lot of drilling activity coming
up in the next 18 months, so spirits are very high. One of the other areas that's really helping focus our capital budget,
and causing us to think about a long-term exciting area, our Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous activities, and it all
keys off our Highlander discovery.
It's going to be easy to talk about Highlander the rest of this decade and so forth and offsets. So, remember, it all started
with Blackbeard and Davy Jones. Blackbeard proved that we could drill the wells, and that there were sands below the
salt weld. Davy Jones was one of the deepest wells in this area, that not only drilled the Miocene, Oligocene, but the
Lower Tertiary, but it also drilled the first Cretaceous well south of the Port Hudson Tuscaloosa/Cretaceous trend, it's
on Map 18. And, north of the BP type of well, which is about 250 miles offshore.
So that key well stratographically set up the drilling toward Highlander as we move closer to the better sands to the
north, and develop not only a huge structure, but also had the reservoir characteristics that we feel is very correlative to
excellent production and reserve deliverability, capabilities in the Gulf Coast space and that's our Highlander discovery.
So, we're in the process of completing Davy Jones #2 in the Cretaceous, it's in a different sand facies, carbonate facies,
that Highlander has. However, we want to continue to learn from the Davy Jones well and we should have that well
tested here in the second quarter. We're probably a month away.
Then we're going to move on to Highlander development. We have that well moving quickly towards completion in the
third quarter, and we hope to have the Blackbeard West completion sometime in early fourth quarter. The Blackbeard
West completion is key because of the laminated sands are going to tell us a lot about our Lafitte discovery that we
made two years ago, and that we've repurchased the leases due to expirations and also we've drawn a lot of correlations
to a recent well we drilled with Shell at Ram Powell, our A11 well in the L sand which is a highly laminated sand, that
made over 220 million barrels at Ram Powell. So the Blackbeard West completion is very important to understanding
what the aspects of that are.
And moving to the West, after drilling a spud well at Lineham Creek, we moved the rig, we're get ready to spud our
Farthest Gate West prospect on the Lacassine Refuge up there in Cameron Parish, and we're looking forward to the
drilling results of that here in about nine to 10 months. All-in-all we're moving forward on development here and look
forward to having a tremendous gas resource here to deliver to the marketplace starting in late 2015, 2016.
Richard, with that, that's the ops update, I'll turn it back over to you.
Richard C. Adkerson
Thanks a lot, Jim. On page 19, we give our update that we do every quarter for the year 2014. Again, this is based on
returning to normal operations at Grasberg in May. While our sales have been restricted, we have produced concentrate
into inventory, and that will allow us as we coordinate future shipments to customers, and our customers have been
working very cooperatively with us as we go through this situation with the export ban, would allow us to recover

much of the shortfall that we had in the first quarter.
So on that basis, we are looking at 4.3 billion pounds of copper sales for 2014, 1.6 million ounces of gold, 97 million
pounds of molybdenum, Dave Thornton's here, the price of moly's gone up 30% in the past month, which is positive for
us. And then the positive outlook of 64.2 million equivalent barrels of 70% of oil.
Unit cost on the basis of $1,300 gold and $10 molybdenum, we're above that right now would be $1.41 for copper. As
Jim talked about a attractive unit cost for oil at $19 per BOE. At $3 copper, last quarter, we were using $3.25. We're
not predicting, we're just showing you a model here that shows operating cash flows of $7.7 billion on the basis of that
plan. Each $0.10 change in copper, for the remainder of 2014, is significant, $275 million. No changes in our capital
expenditure outlook of just over $7 billion.
Page 20 shows our sales profile, as we go forward, you can see the significant increase in volumes that come about as
we bring these development projects online. 2016 is a special year in the sense that it's our last really full year of
production in Grasberg open pit. So we'll have access in that case to very high grades of copper and gold low stripping
and that ends up with an extraordinary year, particularly for gold as you can see it, an outlook for 3 million ounces, but
also for copper. Strong molybdenum sales, growing oil and gas sales, as Jim talked about, and with significant growth
beyond 2016 in the oil and gas business.
Our quarterly outlook is presented on slide 21. You can see increasing volumes as we go through the quarter. Gold
sales at Grasberg are affected by mine sequencing. And you can see our outlook for our oil and gas business as well as
our molybdenum business.
The outlook for site cost in the mining business is presented on page 22. Based on $1,300 gold, $10 molybdenum, our
outlook for consolidated unit cost at $1.41. You can see the spread for our copper sales, we have more than 40% in
North America, more than 30% in South America, roughly just over 20% in Indonesia and 10% in Africa with our
cobalt coming from Africa, our molybdenum principally from North America and our gold from Indonesia.
Our model outlook for EBITDA and cash flows is presented on page 23. What we're showing here is an average of our
2015 and 2016 operating plans and then with set prices with variances for copper, it's the most significant driver of our
earnings and cash flows, and at $3 copper, EBITDA just over $13 billion and $10.5 billion of operating cash flows, $16
billion EBITDA at $3.50 copper, $12.5 billion of operating cash flows. And then if copper were to average $4 during
those two years, then the amounts grow to very significant levels, $18.5 billion and $14 billion.
Sensitivities, for your own use in developing your models, are presented on page 24 and our capital expenditures which
are unchanged from our previous outlook are presented on page 25. This year just over $4 billion for mining, just over
$3 billion of that is for the major projects and $3 billion for oil and gas.
The commitment to balance sheet management, we've been talking about since we announced the oil and gas
acquisitions, we are focused on reducing the acquisition debt, that focus is unchanged. We are dealing with lower
copper prices currently. None of us know what it's going to be as we look forward. We have some headwinds currently
from the Indonesian export situation. We expect that to be resolved and to be able to recover from that very quickly.
But despite those situations, we're still looking at targeting, reducing our debt to something in the range of $12 billion
by the end of 2016. We anticipate continuing our current cash dividend on our common stock at $1.25 a share, and we
will reach this target by managing our large resource base, generating strong cash flows through execution and being
very disciplined in the way we run our business. We're continuing to work on divestiture and monetization
opportunities. We're working with third parties, both in the oil and gas business and the mining business in advancing
potential transactions that would allow us to move towards our debt targets more quickly.
If we run our plans without any divestitures, the story is a good one, even at $3 copper. We get down to the range of
$14 billion even at the reduced profit level by the end of 2016. But we want to get there quicker and we're working
hard to do it. We have opportunities to do it with our asset base. We can't announce specifics today, but we can report
that as a management team, we feel good about what we're pursuing. And we're looking at other opportunities beyond
straight asset sales in terms of joint venture arrangements, potential MLP opportunities focusing in on our California
properties, which would be very attractive for the MLP market.

So, all of those things are at work and the story today is there's no wavering in our commitment to get to where we need
to get to have that strong balance sheet. So, that's our report for this quarter. Some challenges, but that's the nature of
our business, we've been there before and we met them and we will meet these. And we look forward to answering
your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question
comes from the line of David Gagliano with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - David Gagliano>: [ph] It's great (43:40) to be first up, let me just ask a couple of quick questions on Grasberg,
please. First of all on the commentary regarding the contingency plans, you mentioned i.e. more workforce reductions,
capital spending reductions, what's a reasonable time period to expect for the start of these contingency plans, is this
something we should expect to start to occur in Q2, Q3 or next year?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Dave, what would drive that is not anything that's from a timing standpoint forces
us to do it. So long as we feel as we do now, that we're moving towards a resolution of this issue then we will not go
through the negative impacts of having workforce reductions and capital deferrals. That's where we've been so far. If
there were to be something happening within the government that would lead us to conclude at any point in time that
they're just going to leave this situation in place for a long period of time, that's when we would act.
So, we believe this is going to be resolved in the relatively near future that there's progress being made, that people are
working towards reaching resolution. And we would only act if we got word from the government, hey, we're not going
to do anything, we're just going to leave this in place. So it's not a specific time, but more of a reading of the progress
that's being made towards resolution.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay, okay. That's helpful, thanks. And then just somewhat related, the rate of deferral each
month that went, I think, it's now indicating about 50 million pounds of deferred volumes each month that you're
unable to export concentrates. I'm just curious, why did that deferral rate increase, I think, it was 40 million pounds,
previously, 40 million pounds a month?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah, Dave, this is Kathleen, we're just getting into some higher grade potential and so that
just reflects that the gold is the same as what we had said before. But, the copper's, a little higher impact.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: You see, what we did, Dave, is when this first started, we moved out of the lower
reaches of the pit and started focusing on mining at the higher areas, where we had waste material. All of this were
things we were going to have to do over time in our mine plan. So we mined lower grade material, waste, lower grade
material put some in stockpiles. And now just because of mine sequencing, we end up getting into some higher grade
material.
<Q - David Gagliano>: All right. Perfect, I got it. All right, why don't I hop out, thanks for taking the questions and
good quarter by the way.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks a lot, Dave.

question.

<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Hello.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Tony, are you there?
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Yes, I'm here. Can you hear me?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We can hear you now.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: All right, good, good. Wow, I thought I was going to be shut out of asking a question here.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: That'll never happen.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: All right, listen congrats on a better performance and much better costs in Indonesia than we
expected, especially during this very difficult time. And it seems as though there was a bit of a breakthrough recently at
least in the regaining the ability to export. And this morning, it looks like there's an article in the Jakarta Post that
indicates that the government has revised the controversial export duty, and according to the Deputy Finance Minister,
I guess, which is being quoted, but is the progressive export tax now no longer an issue, Richard?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Tony, let me just make a comment. And this is not just unique to Indonesia, you
see it here in newspapers. As you know, because you've followed us over a long period of time, we just caution you
about reacting to daily press releases. Comments were made by a variety of people in government and there's
inconsistencies. We will keep everybody informed when there are major developments and so forth. Now, we think the
current export duty is prohibitive. It goes up to 60%, you just can't pay that and run your business.
So when we talk about progress, it is progress in the sense of dealing with this export duty and that would mean
adjusting it downward. Our contract says that we pay no taxes or duties other than the ones listed in the contract and so
that's one of these issues of where people in the government are focusing on the new mining law, we're focusing on our
contract and that's part of the discussions that are going on.
So, there is progress being made, the progress would necessarily entail a dealing with the currently prohibitively high
export duties. But there are no – there's no announcements that we're prepared to make today about conclusions and
when there are, we would make them. It will require the Ministry of Finance to adopt new regulations. They have not
done that yet. We have had an important step in being designated as an authorized exporter by the Ministry of Trade,
but there's several procedural steps that we have to go through to get this behind us.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Okay. Could you maybe discuss in greater detail the complexities you guys are facing as it
relates to the COW extension and in light of the 2009 mining law, I know there were further changes in 2012 and the
government seems like it is trying to convert the COW to that new business license structure. Should I be looking at
these discussions, all of these whether it be the concentrate exports, export taxes, smelters as being linked or are they
separate and distinct from the COW extension discussions?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. It's all linked fundamentally, but we are focusing immediately on trying to get to a
point of where we can export concentrates and return to normal operations. That will not require dealing with all of the
COW issues. We would like to see the COW issues dealt with. We've been working very actively with the government
for two and half years now to do that, that's complicated and difficult to do in the current political environment. So it's a
two step process. First step is to reach a basis through regulatory changes and government approvals, so that we can
resume exports to get back to working in a normal way. And we'll continue to have discussions on the COW extension
and that's where this issue comes up of our being committed to supporting and defending our COW, the government
wanting to move COW holders to the new regime that's defined by the 2009 mining law and that's the basis for the
debate.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Okay, okay. All right. Then just to switch gears a little bit here, in terms of the asset sales. In
the discussion you indicated that you're actively engaged in discussions, I was wondering does the expansion enhance
long-term viability of Morenci, make it more likely you guys could part with other lesser core assets in North American
mining?

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, that's an interesting question. We have opportunities to do that, but I think, you
were down in CESCO Week in Chile, unfortunately I couldn't make it this year. But I think one of the things that
comes out of there is the reality the mining industry is facing. The U.S. is increasingly looking attractive for
development. The energy situation here, that's affecting industrial development across the board in the U.S. comes into
play here in the U.S. for our mining projects. So today, the U.S. has a very significant advantage over expansions in
South America because of the cheaper energy here. We're also seeing increasingly the benefits of the U.S. workforce.
We're non-unionized here. We have a very flexible workforce where it's easier to staff up for expansions, and then
adjust if you have to adjust than in South America, where you have unions and government policies that make it
difficult to flex your workforce.
Water is an issue in the United States, but Red and his group have done a great job in securing water opportunity for us
here in Arizona. Water is a huge, huge problem in Chile and it ties into energy because of having to use de-sal projects
that requires a lot of energy to pump the water and run the projects. So, when we size things up, we're increasingly
encouraged about opportunities to expand in the U.S. and more than half of our resources now are in the U.S. So in any
event, you know this Southwest Copper District has rolled away the stone from the tomb, and is looking really good for
us. And so what we wouldn't want to do is sell assets that have significant growth opportunities, because we're so
positive about the long-term future for copper, and we have those in the U.S.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: It makes a lot of sense, that's – I think – I appreciate the insights, and yes, I did miss you at
CESCO there, Richard.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yep. I missed it, too, Tony. All right. Thanks a lot. If you have further questions, we'll
let you get back in line.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Hi, Sal.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: I wanted to just ask if your current labor force, you are still keeping them, my understanding is
that they're doing some maintenance work pre-stripping. Does it imply that the future cost could be better if once these
things are resolved as some of the preparation work is being done right now?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, the answer is, yes. I mean our cost structure in large part is fixed, we do have
some variable costs, but we have a lot of fixed costs. So, obviously, we get volumes back up, you're going to see the
unit costs come down. But we are getting ahead of the curve, as you mentioned, some stripping activities, and some
maintenance activities and that will have some benefits at the margin as we go forward.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Okay.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: But the key to it is getting those volumes flowing. That's where we make the money,
because we [ph] have to try (55:51) our margins, and we need to get the shipments going to our customers outside
Indonesia.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Got you. And, Richard, is there any difficulty or concern that if you reach an agreement and the
new government comes in and they may have a different view again. Is that also hampering the discussion or you're
confident that whatever deal you make or whatever resolution you make with the current government will actually be
honored by the next government. And we have seen Indonesian government has – what they've done with the COW,

and changed the rules during the game and if there's a concern that it may happen again even after the resolution with
the current government.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Listen, we've been there for over 40 years. If you think about the huge concerns that
were from the unknowns that happens when Suharto stepped down in 1998 and the government has evolved since then.
The government will continue to be evolved in Indonesia. There's a lot of places in the world. There's a lot of
nationalistic political views that's popular with the local population, it really comes into play with natural resources and
that's just something we have to deal with. So, the answer is we're going to be dealing with this issue forever and we've
had experience with it. There's a lot of reasons for whoever – the basic issue for Indonesia is this. Indonesia has grown
so much and has developed over the 25 years that I've been going there. They still have a growing young population
with a lot of unemployment. And while there local economy is developed, they need to create jobs. Any political leader
that comes in there from whatever party is going to be faced with the necessity of creating jobs or they're going to fail.
And to create jobs in the media does not have an internal savings rate that's enough to fund the capital investment to
create jobs. So they're going to need foreign investment and regardless of nationalistic views or feelings about
self-sufficiency, which you hear a lot of today in Indonesia, the reality that people face there is as around the world
people face, is creating jobs for young people, and in Indonesia that's going to require foreign investment, and that's
going to require Indonesia being part of the world's economy, and that's the reality.
We stay out of politics. The people of Indonesia choose the kind of government they want to have and we don't try to
influence that. We prepare ourselves to work with whatever government that the people will elect.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Did I understand that the smelter is going to create 500 jobs and if you shut half the mine down,
that's going to cost 15,000 jobs to go away?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We've had those discussions. You can be sure that those discussions are made. Part of
the problem that's a complication, as I'm sure you know, Sal, is this was originally directed at other minerals, where
Indonesia is the world's largest export of nickel ores, I think they provide two thirds of the bauxite to China, significant
tin export. And in those industries, where they were just exporting ores, Indonesia was seeing value creation going to
other countries, that's not what it is for copper, but politically, we're in a complicated situation in trying to say, treat
copper in a company like Freeport differently than you're treating the small nickel exporters, and that's a tough political
situation for the government to be in, but yes, we've made that point, and you're right.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: If you could expand on the asset sale potential I think in the past, companies talked about
potential of $3 billion to $4 billion of asset sales, and then, specifically with regards to California, as you're thinking on
the MLP opportunity that you would want to divest that to an existing MLP or potentially create your own?
<A - James C. Flores>: This is Jim. Regarding asset sales, we're looking at exploring all options. The MLP study and
discussion we've been having internally is basically maximizing the value of our onshore oil assets, they're long-lived,
they're low decline, they're the prototype MLP asset. Any investment bank or banker in any of your firms will come tell
you that aspect of it, but the key is, and foremost, what to do for the FCX shareholder. And as Richard and Kathleen
talked about our balance sheet discipline, and with high oil prices gives us an opportunity to transfer some of that value
from the assets themselves to the FCX share in the form of debt repayment. That being said, we still want to maximize
our oil business because of the high margins and the growth. And what we're seeing, this is going to be a long-winded
answer to your MLP question, but what we're seeing in the Gulf of Mexico is all the growth potential we have, all the
development activity and the ability to grow that business much faster. So we're in the early stages of getting our hands

around rotating out of our onshore oil business at the highest value possible and the MLP might be a vehicle to do that
either internally or sell or joint venture with existing MLPs or just sell out right those assets and monetize those assets
and help accelerate the Gulf of Mexico.
What we found in our modeling is that we can grow faster in the Gulf and hit the same targets by monetizing the
onshore assets and rotating into the offshore business. The MLP discussions or valuations are going to be one part of
doing that successfully because of the valuations for those assets. The current headwinds in the MLP market are severe
with the banks exiting the hedging markets and the severe backwardation. You've got 20%, 25% of backwardation in
the crude oil curve over the next 36 months, yet you got oil demand never stronger, it's up 1 million barrels a day,1.5
million barrels a day worldwide with 3% GDP growth.
So there's going to be continued headwinds to doing a traditional MLP of just hedging out some oil volumes, levering it
up and selling it to another set of investors. At the same point in time, these properties are going to be around for a
long, long time. So what you could see is the next several years is that's rotating that business, continue to use the
excess sales proceeds to reduce the balance sheet as well as rotate to higher growth assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the
$3 billion to $4 billion target that we've all talked about is going to be underpinned by that activity as well as anything
on the mining side.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. Here's where it comes together. Here's fundamentally where we're approaching
the oil and gas business and the mining business the same from this perspective. We're big believers in the future of the
commodities. We're big believers in the future of growth through our set of assets. So we're looking to enhance the
assets where we can grow and look at our other assets, which have value and are good assets that we might could
monetize through sale, joint venture, MLP and reach this debt target. But we are not, as I've mentioned in the response
to Tony, we don't want to sell assets that take away from our future growth opportunities. In fact, we want to look to
ways to enhance those assets.
So we've got – we've got those opportunities across the board. And Curt, we're just not at the point where we are in our
discussion to be able to tell you specifically what we're doing, but our targets remain the same and we're optimistic
about achieving them.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Okay. That's very helpful and I appreciate it. And just a follow-up on Indonesia. It seems
like one of the key points the government's trying to make is to get the companies to adhere to obviously the new
licensing agreements, which you guys stated. And I think that for most companies operating under those IUPs, there's a
mandatory divestment process whereas after five years you have to start divesting your ownership stake. And I think by
year 10, it's below I think 51%. I was wondering, is this going to affect your view towards capital allocation going
forward at Grasberg? Obviously, there's a substantial CapEx plan as you go underground and do you have confidence
that you'll be able to effectively uphold the existing terms that you have regarding your ownership stake?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. You're right about the IUP. We have a Contract of Work, and under that contract,
we have no divestiture obligations. As we've talked before, what we're trying to do is to sit down with the government,
find ways that we can be responsive to certain of their aspirations and voluntarily change the contract without throwing
it out the window, and abandon it as a way of protecting our interest. For example, with divestitures, we think if we is
part of an agreement to extend the contract, and to resolve all these issues related to the review of the contract in the
mining law that for us to list an interest of PT-FI on the Indonesian exchange would be positive for all parties, positive
for the government, positive for us. So that's the sort of thing that we're talking about doing.
But as I mentioned earlier, the challenges of our debate is this issue you raised with the government wanting to go more
in the direction of a 2009 mining law, we wanting to extend the contract, and trying to reach agreement on that during
an election year where all the politics are volatile. So that's why we're focusing first on getting back to work with our
exports and continuing the discussions on the contract beyond that. If we could resolve the whole issue then we'd do it,
we'd want to do it. But we've got to face the realities of where we are in the context of Indonesia today.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: But to go back to your deal, we are confident we're going to be able to have a resolution
to this, so we can continue underground development. So we can operate there through 2041 in a very profitable,
low-cost way. This has changed our view about exploration outside of PT-FI, and looking at other places in Indonesia.
Unfortunately for the country, this new mining law is making it very difficult to do new projects there in the mining
business. And so, we have backed off of some of our exploration opportunities that we were pursuing because of the
new mining law, that doesn't apply to PT-FI.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Got it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Profiti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ralph Profiti>: ... Indonesia, perhaps for Kathleen, I'm wondering how Indonesia may affect liquidity decisions
in the next say six months. We saw a net cash drawdown in the quarter, and which bringing the cash balance down, but
between sort of substantial lines of credit available, the dividend, CapEx and as Indonesia, and all these things come
together, how is that strategy if any likely to change over the next six months as it pertains to liquidity?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Well, as we've been talking about, our current plan is that we'll be able to resume normal
exports in the second quarter, and obviously, what we have contingency plans as well that deal with, if the situation is
extended. We're not currently expecting that, but we do have contingency plans, as you point out we do have a very
large undrawn revolver and do have cash on hand. But we'll manage the situation, we'll manage our outflows, we'll
manage our CapEx all to maintain a very strong liquidity position.
<Q - Ralph Profiti>: Okay. Thank you. And my second question is maybe a little bit more of housekeeping. There was
a $0.49 per pound that was excluded in the site production cost at PT-FI and I'm just wondering is that related to the
increased waste stripping, if we can have a little bit of discussion on what's actually in that $0.49?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah. Those were costs that were charged directly to cost of sales rather than going through
the normal process of going through inventory and then into cost of sales as the concentrate is sold. What we did and
this is consistent with accounting rules, when you're not operating at normal levels, you need to keep your inventory
balances at what they would otherwise would have been. So during the quarter, we incurred those costs that were
outside of – because we didn't have the volumes in inventory, those went directly to cost of sales. But they were just the
normal cost of our operations that just was excess of what our normal inventory values would have been had we been
operating at normal capacity.
<Q - Ralph Profiti>: I see. Okay. Thank you very much. That's clear.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It was explained as the cost of excess capacity to me. I mean, for example, if we couldn't
export anything or couldn't ship anything, we charge all the costs that we're incurring directly as an expense of having
excess capacity and this is an element of excess capacity that we have.
<Q - Ralph Profiti>: Thank you. That's very clear.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Ralph, I'm glad you called on Kathleen. One of the benefits I have as she looks over my
shoulder as I'm making all these comments. I mentioned that the Indonesian elections were last week, they were
actually on April 9, just to be accurate.
<Q - Ralph Profiti>: Thanks again.

<Q - Tony D. Robson>: Thank you. Good morning all, and thank you, Richard, for taking my question. Following on
from Tony's comments regarding the Jakarta Post's article and I understand your comment not to jump on the latest
things you hear from Indonesia, but it reiterated again, the comments from the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry
(sic) [Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources] that talked about a flat export duty of 10%. Would a flat 10% export
duty for say the next three or four years while you're building a smelter, would that be acceptable to Freeport and to
PT-FI or would that be – because it cuts across your Contract of Work as you've well pointed out, would that be an
unacceptable compromise to you guys? Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, I'm going to repeat the caution about assigning too much weight to even specific
comments that are attributed to individual government officials. So I would again just suggest like I do, I read the
papers every morning, every evening, but don't react specifically to what people are said to have been – said to –
quoted as to having said. So I would just caution you about putting too much weight on that. But you do touch on an
important issue for us and other contracted work holders. Is that whatever the rate is, if one is imposed it would be
contrary to the contract provision to say that we're only subject to taxes that are identified there. We have urged the
government, if they do impose the rate, to treat it as an income tax payment, and have it creditable against income taxes
– as an offset to income taxes, and that way our taxes would be limited to what's in the contract. We recognize that that
might be difficult for the government to implement. So what we will be faced with is how to deal with this. I mean we
have a strong incentive about going back to work, principally to avoid harm to our workers in the local community. We
can manage this ourselves financially for the company, but we will have to work with the government on how we deal
with this conflict, and how we preserve our rights for the contract, and we're just going to have to wait to see what the
regulations are before we respond specifically to that. So – Tony, I'm sure you can appreciate, we can't speculate on
that right now, until we see what's comes out of the government.
<Q - Tony D. Robson>: I understand and thank you for that, Richard.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. Thanks, Tony.

Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: ... later...good morning, everyone. First of all, congratulations on the strong results. We're
starting to get used to oil and gas exceeding expectations. So hopefully that can be kept up, just want to start first with a
clarification. During your remarks, Richard, you mentioned that at $3 copper, you expected the net debt to be down to
$14 billion. Does that imply that you expect to get about $2 billion in the monetization of whatever the case may be,
joint ventures or asset sales?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No, and that's based on a model of just running our business and achieving our
production volumes and cost and based on $3 copper and $1,300 gold and $10 molybdenum and oil prices being
roughly at where they are today. So the point I was making is even though we've had a drop in copper prices, we still
have a very strong business of generating cash flows at today's prices.
Now, if prices weaken or if costs go up or we have production disruptions. One of the reasons we want to de-risk the
balance sheet by advancing these sales and get all this debt talk behind us, but if in fact, we have other headwinds to
deal with, which in our business, you might have that. We always have the flexibility of reducing capital spending,
particularly, in the oil and gas business as we talked about before, much more so in the mining business, you can defer
capital spending and cut back, it's more discretionary. You don't lose resources by doing that.
As you know, Oscar, because you've been there. It'd be very tough for us to back off of Cerro Verde now given where
we are with our oil and gas capital spending. We have more flexibility, if we were to have to, to adjust capital spending.
So what my only point was we haven't run off any cliff here from our basic operating situation and we still have a
strong business because of our margins at today's copper prices and commodity prices, we still generate a lot of cash.

It's going to be backend loaded because of our capital spending and the fact that we get the benefit of volumes after the
capital projects are finished. But even with that backend loaded and copper prices coming off of $3.30 to over $3 now,
we still have a very strong outlook.
<A - James C. Flores>: Oscar, I was reiterating the fact that the Gulf of Mexico as we get further into this, we're
getting more comfortable with it. We're getting out of some of the planning and volatility. We're starting to see success
and results and so forth. And it's really allowing us to have more flexibility. As Richard said to support the aspect of
strength in the balance sheet. And, at the same point in time, dynamically growing more business to support the overall
corporation's growth long-term. So, as we're going through this process, there's nothing like a little low copper prices to
make you refine the business strategy and look at things in a different way. And I think it's been a positive result. And
everybody that's been involved in the situation and asked to step up the execution on the operations front has responded
and I'm just continue to be pleased with our ability to kind of work in tandem to the corporate goals and at the same
point in time, wring out some operating excellence, flexibility for each and every business unit and we expect that to
continue.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Thank you, both. I'm not questioning the strength of the operations whatsoever, it's more like if
you're building a new smelter refinery in Indonesia then just wanted to gauge the flexibility on that net debt target,
because expenditure of $3.5 billion or $4 billion over there. And I know you probably get a joint venture partner, it
would be a different story, but anyway, second question...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, let me make clear on that. Just to be specific, Oscar, that doesn't include that kind
of spending in Indonesia. We are talking with partners. We've also talked with the government about the need to have
government incentives to deal with part of that cost. But that's not in the numbers that I talked about, but that's
something that would have to be dealt with, but all, there's several moving parts right now [indiscernible] (1:18:53) get
B of A as a partner [indiscernible] (1:18:59)
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Sure, but you're talking to the wrong guy, though. I would ... okay, sorry. And then in the spirit
of educating the mining guy. Your oil and gas sales projections for 2016, at the end of the year, you said 81 million
barrels of oil equivalent in 2016. Now we're looking at 78 million barrels of oil equivalent, and I'm guessing this is just
deferral, but could you just go over where the change was or what's causing that reduction?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Oscar, this is Kathleen. I think you'll notice we moved some production into 2014. We were
previously saying 61 million BOEs and now we're 64 million BOEs and we have moved some of the planned shut-ins
into 2015, and then moved some from 2015 into 2016. So, that's affected the volumes, but that's really what's driving it.
And I think you'll see getting some volumes accelerated to do what we can to offset some of the shortfalls we've had in
the mining business.
<A - James C. Flores>: Right. And Oscar, and the shut-ins, she's talking about are the platform modifications so we
can bring on the incremental production from the tiebacks. As we've looked again thinking about the business and
every day and making sure we're making the best decisions it made operational sense to group all those together at the
end of 2015 and first quarter of 2016. And so, those affected production, it wouldn't be individual well, it's just timing
of those 45 day shut-ins for each one of those major facilities.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And, it's worth pointing out that these facilities were acquired from BP and Shell in the
fall of 2012. So, the team is learning more and getting experienced with it, and so, changes in this range, Oscar, are just
to be expected. I mean there's nothing that's significant about it, as Kathleen said, it's just we try to give you an outlook
every quarter, and outlooks are going to change.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Yeah, no, no, I appreciate that, Richard. Thank you all and just again educating the mining guy,
thanks very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, you're making a lot of progress, Oscar. We're going to keep working with you.

Your next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: ...that's Grasberg, I can see that the mill operating rate declined versus the last quarter,. But,
what about the mining rate, did that remain pretty much unchanged so you just basically did more stripping?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It did, it was in the range of changes, it was down a little bit, our mine rate in our DOZ
mine, which is at relatively full capacity, is still what, Mark?
<A - Mark J. Johnson>: 50,000 tons.... instead of 65,000 or 70,000. Yeah.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: 50,000 tons instead of 65,000 tons or 70,000 tons. So, we are making some adjustments
to that, and listen, somebody mentioned earlier, Mark Johnson's here, those guys have done a great job. I mean we
completed our labor contract last fall, we've had a harmonious situation working, we've had a good safety performance
in the first quarter, which is a big concern and focus of our company, after the experiences of the last couple of years.
But the team has worked very well together, we appreciate the support of our union and our workers, but so we've
tweaked it, Paretosh, it's down slightly, but we are continuing to operate at essentially full mining rates.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Got it. And maybe a quick one for Jim, a question similar to Oscar's question. For second half
of 2014, third quarter guidance is up, but fourth quarter is unchanged. Anything major that's driving that?
<A - James C. Flores>: Yes. That was what Kathleen talked about, we had previously planned to shut our Marlin
facility down for the entirety of the third quarter 2014. We've now shift that to the third quarter of 2015. So that's
between 30,000 and 40,000 barrels a day that will be on stream here in the fourth quarter and add to those volumes and
those numbers.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Got it. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you very much for all your efforts resolving the issues overseas and the patient
deliberations on the refinancing, I'm a small shareholder and appreciate your hard work. Some of Jim's comments,
about the oil and the gas properties went over my head. Could you explain the un-risked potential? Is that before a
feasibility study saying what's recoverable? And could you elaborate a little bit about the Highlander discovery and its
relationship to Davy Jones and Blackbeard and the deep output potential, please.
<A - James C. Flores>: Sure, John. On page 15, you're talking about the green box in our slide, say a total of net
un-risked resource potential of 1.1 billion BOEs, barrels of oil equivalent, that was respective to the blocks, the new
tracks, the new leases that we're the apparent high bidder on it and awaiting to be awarded, trying to give everybody a
feel of what we feel is the resource potential. When we start talking about putting it into a plan to be funded as a CapEx
side, and we're refining those plans. We will do it on a risk basis to make sure it's competitive with the rate of returns
on a risk basis.
But when you're risking one billion barrels of oil, you get to a big number. When you start from one billion barrels of
oil, when you start risking you get to a big number, especially when you're talking about $10 to $15 a barrel cost,
maybe as low as $5 in some of these cases, some nice big reservoirs, when you already have the infrastructure in place.
So I appreciate your question and give you a little more on that.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Let me say because I've talked with John so long about this. Maybe... John what this is,
this is the geologic analysis of what the opportunity is. So in the oil and gas business...

<Q - John C. Tumazos>: [indiscernible] (1:25:50)
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes, so in the oil and gas business, what the next step would be, would be to do further
geologic analysis of the sub surface through seismic studies and so forth, but ultimately, you have to drill wells to have
discoveries or not, and then you delineate it, and then you move towards a development plan. So this is sort of like in
the mining industry of having widely spaced core holes, and now you have to do exploratory drilling, delineation
drilling, and then you move towards deciding specifically how you have a development plan.
<A - James C. Flores>: Does that make sense, John?
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: That's really good. Thank you, Jim and Richard. Could you explain a little bit, the
Highlander discovery and the analogies to the other deep wells that was a little bit fuzzy to me?
<A - James R. Moffett>: John. This is Jim Bob. Let me just pick up on the Highlander discovery. The Highlander
discovery is important because as we moved from the deepwater and tied from the deepwater to Blackbeard and Davy
Jones. As Jim said, we saw the [ph] real crash (1:27:18) in the Tuscaloosa, but we had a facing there, but didn't have
the porosities and permeabilities, and thickness that you see on the Highlander discovery.
And the reason why the Highlander discovery is so important is because we thought that as we moved to the north and
drilled the terrain, the Davy Jones and the Tuscaloosa trend as you see to the north of Highlander and the logs on the
right hand column of slide 18 show that three things have happened.
We're gone below the salt weld, this is the first well. We have another salt weld onshore and yet, if you look at this
even though we're 10,000 feet deeper if you look at that [indiscernible] (1:28:20) we've now got porosities in the high
20s and spots of 30% porosity and it has to do with the mineralogy of the Tuscaloosa sands. So, what we are seeing
here is a test that defines what the central part of onshore Louisiana is going to look like. Now, remember, this is a 200
square mile by 100 square mile area, and as you see from that circle around the Tuscaloosa trend, just like all of the
Miocene and Wilcox and other trends that parallel the coastline.
So, what this Highlander really does is it gives you a prototype well, and what we think is happening is that you have a
East-West trend that parallels that coastline once again. And so, this opens up a whole new arena and our database is
the only one that has sufficiently worked here onshore, so between that well and the well at Lineham Creek, which
[indiscernible] (1:29:49) for the first time. We got two new trends that are onshore and that is different than Blackbeard
and different than Davy Jones, because we're basically defining East-West opportunities in the structure there are huge.
Highlander's a 30,000 acre structure. So, we're looking at trying to control all of these big trend plays. So the
Highlander discovery and the Lineham Creek discovery and then finding two new reservoirs that have good perm and
good porosity, they have a long producing history. Ironically, the Tuscaloosa is the [ph] same name (1:30:50) for the
Woodbine in Texas which is the big East Texas field. So, we're talking about big [ph] petro (1:31:00) reservoirs that
produce billions of barrels. So, that's the significance of Highlander, it opens up a whole new trend, and we've got the
data, and we're acquiring the major prospects. We're way out in front of the rest of the industry on those two. I hope
that clarifies why the Highlander's so important.

smelter costs. I think last quarter you guys said maybe less than $3 billion, and then Oscar earlier mentioned $3.5

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah, and part of it is and this is just to indicate what the study is. The current smelter
we have at Grasberg is a Mitsubishi technology smelter that's continuous casting. New smelters that are being built in
China are Outokumpu type flash smelters, is what we have in a version of that – an early version of that in [ph] Belva
(1:32:39) and Atlantic Copper and also right in our Miami smelter here in the United States. China, which has been
constructing smelters aggressively in recent years because of their internal demand for copper, have advanced that
technology and are building large-scale smelters using the Outokumpu type flash smelting. So one of the things we're
studying is different aspects of that.
We had an international engineering firm do a pre-feasibility type study, which was focused on the Mitsubishi type
situation that's what we talked about earlier. I think at this point and we're working with ANTAM, which is suggesting
that within Indonesia we might – could have beneficial labor costs, et cetera. So it's in the range of $2 billion to $2.5
billion is a number to think about. There's some working capital issues associated with that, but all of this is still within
a pretty wide range of potential estimating, and I won't call it errors, but just estimating ranges because of the state of
the studies today.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, back to the earlier discussion about MLPs.
My understanding is that the valuation step up, a good portion of it has to do with tax savings, but you don't pay any
taxes at least at the operations level, both at the energy or on the copper side. So are there corporate tax savings that
you would expect to realize from putting some assets into an MLP type structure, that we are – should take into
consideration?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Let me just make a couple of comments about taxes. We pay substantial foreign taxes as
you know, where we operate. So our cash tax obligations are substantial not so much in the United States particularly
with oil and gas acquisition because of some net operating loss carry forwards that transferred over, and the current
deductibility of intangible drilling and development costs. So there, the benefit is not so much to the corporation but to
the investors.
In other words, the initial attractiveness of MLPs was to individual investors where you weren't faced with having taxes
at a corporate level and then taxes on dividends. It was a true partnership so it eliminated the entity level taxes, and then
the tax attributes like IDCs and so forth flow through directly to the unit holders. But what's happened since – in the
development of the MLP concept is today even a number of non-taxpaying investors, institutional investors are
attracted to MLPs because of the distribution aspects of it in the low interest rate environment.
In other words, they see distributions from MLPs providing current cash returns in relation to investment and other
income yielding type vehicles. So a lot of today's investors in MLPs, are not attracted to it from the tax attribute side,
it's still there for individual investors, but more just from the fact that MLPs are structured in ways to give attractive
current income distributions. And so, that's resulted in attractive multiples in the public marketplace. Those are
admittedly higher for what's called midstream MLPs, where you have contracts to give a surety about cash flows and
upstream MLPs typically trade at lower valuations, but we have assets particularly in California that are attractive for
the MLP model and it gives us opportunity to look at it.
As Jim talked about our real objective here, which is maybe different from some other MLP developers is to create a
monetization event. So – we can meet our debt targets. We're really focused on building value in FCX shares, and that's
what we really want to do. As a management team, we're in the same shoes as our shareholders, and we're trying to find
ways of increasing the value of FCX shares. We feel they're significantly undervalued today. Almost every
management team you talk to is going to say that, but we believe we can by executing our plans, experience in what we
believe will be favorable future markets, dealing with problems like this Indonesian problem, and strengthening our
balance sheet, we think that ultimately that will translate into higher share price, and that's what we're all working
towards.

<Q - David A. Lipschitz>: Good morning. My quick question is have you talked with other companies other than the
government, such as Newmont or something like that about building a smelter, are they involved in those talks as well?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, the answer is definitely yes, we've talked with other companies in an appropriate
way about their situations, and Newmont will speak for themselves, but their resource is significantly different than the
Grasberg resource, always has been, and in particularly in terms of mine life and so forth. But I mentioned we're
working with Aneka Tambang (ANTAM), the state-owned mining company in Indonesia. We've also had discussions
with others. And so, we are open to working partners and have active discussions going on with them.
<Q - David A. Lipschitz>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Garrett Nelson with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Garrett S. Nelson>: Thanks. I noticed there were some fairly significant upward revisions to third quarter sales
guidance for both copper, gold, and oil and gas in the fire-up date. I think Jim covered the oil and gas side, but on the
mining side, what's driving that relative to the guidance you put out in the January?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: It's manly the changes in the Grasberg volumes and the timing of those.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It's the make-up. In other words, our production of copper concentrates is higher than
our sales. And so, we've increased our inventory of copper concentrates, which with clearance to export will work its
way into the marketplace over time. So, that's why we talk about the shortfall as not being lost volumes, but deferred
volumes.
<Q - Garrett S. Nelson>: Okay. And then switching over, as you noted the moly market has shown some signs of life
here over the past couple of months. It's the world's largest producer of that metal, I was hoping you could provide
some color as to what you're seeing fundamentally that's driving the price strengthening?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: I'm going to ask Dave Thornton to come down here, and get by the phone. He's – Dave
is the guy who runs our moly business.
<A - David Thornton>: Yeah, the fundamentals are basically that the markets tightened up primarily in Europe, as
we've seen some improvement in the European economies, mainly Spain, Italy, big steel producing regions and
countries, and then the supply has been tight. So, mainly the traders are in the market, the suppliers that are basically
like us are meeting our contractual obligations. So mine supply is tight. Demand has picked up a little bit, but not a lot.
But because of the tightness in the market we're seeing that the traders are involved more and we're seeing some uptick.
Prices increased roughly $3 in a month. And that's still occurring, although we are seeing that the trade is backing off a
little bit and taking some profits. It looks like recently, so the prices come back off to around $12.50 is the last I heard.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. Molybdenum is a relatively small global market.
<Q - Garrett S. Nelson>: Right
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And so changes can have a dramatic effect over short periods of time. Most
molybdenum goes as a metal into steel alloys, a significant part of our production because of our high grade of
molybdenum that we produce at our standalone molybdenum mines in Colorado, Henderson and Climax goes into
higher value from a margin standpoint – chemical marketplace, where it's used as catalyst in refineries and for other
high-end chemical uses. But with Europe being a substantial steel producer and with some upticks in the steel

Your next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Chuck A. Bradford>: Hi. Good morning. I've just gotten back from China and they've continued to revise their
back data for, right now it's 2013 effective which is to reduce the growth rates in March 2014. The same thing
occurred, of course, all of last year. Do you have any evidence or have you seen anything whether the same is occurring
in copper? Because frankly our copper concentrate data out of China has almost disappeared and we're sort of at a loss
as whether the same thing is occurring?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Copper concentrate data?
<Q - Chuck A. Bradford>: Yeah.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well. You are seeing a situation of where with the development of the smelter business
in China, there is more imported concentrates in relation to cathodes than there's been historically. But listen, Chuck –
we commercially sell product into China. We sell copper, cobalt, occasionally some molybdenum, and we work
directly with customers. We're not traders, and you know the numbers you talk about get obscured because of this issue
of how copper flows in and out of these bonded warehouses and so forth, and I know it's a complicated situation. We're
not a great source of information for that sort of thing. All I can report on is how we're dealing with customers in the
normal course of business, and what we're seeing is relatively strong demand both for copper and for cobalt.
<Q - Chuck A. Bradford>: Just we've been tracking in the past their own copper concentrate production, tying it to
imports, and then eventually into refined output. And I just – the data just is a little bit more sparse than usual. But they
seem to have been reporting much lower growth rates than otherwise would have been the case, if they hadn't revised
up last year.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. There's a CRU report that came out this morning. I read it in the predawn hours
and you can look at it and see their commentary on that very subject.
<Q - Chuck A. Bradford>: Well, thank you very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks.

Your final question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. For Indonesia and I think it's come up
before the smelter there's been different cost estimates and whatever, but I just want to be clear. This smelter if it gets
built, will be big enough to take the remaining concentrate out of Grasberg going forward? So we're not going to get
stuck with say 20% of the con still getting hit with a graduated tax. I mean, it would seem to me that would be an
awfully big smelter.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well. It would – there are capacity limits for building a smelter. The biggest smelters in
the world are flash furnace smelters that can produce 400,000 tons a year, which say it takes 1.6 million tons of
concentrate, that plus Grasberg would not cover us in all years, but our production is variable, particularly as we make
this transition from open pit to total underground operation, so that is one of the complicated issues we're dealing with.
I just want to point out something, Brian. Under the current regulations, the export duty applies to all concentrate

exports, not just what's net above future smelter requirements. So that's one of the issues that's still under discussions,
and subject to regulatory changes. There are other developers I might mention, Indonesian companies who've indicated
a plan to develop smaller scale smelters in Indonesia, there's not lot of details on those plans. We have signed
conditional sales agreements to sell potentially certain amount of concentrates to those Indonesians smelter developers.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Great. Thanks. My second question then just relates – as you mentioned you do pay a lot
of taxes to the Indonesians, can you just refresh my memory, how you pay them like when they get their cash? And
secondly, the fact that now you're only at 40%, and therefore, you're not paying tax on exported concentrate, does that
affect the overall tax structure at all going forward?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No, our taxes are defined by the Contract of Work. We have a 35% tax rate even though
the tax rate generally in Indonesia today is 25%. And then, and that tax is based on income. There is some specific rules
about how you calculate it, but it's an accounting-based taxable income determination, you apply that rate to it. Then in
addition, when dividends are paid from PT-FI to FCX, there's an incremental 10% tax on those dividends. And so,
that's where you add that up plus the royalties, plus the dividends on the government's 9.36% equity interest is where
you get the Indonesian government's participation in total income at greater than 50%. And so, what's affecting the
current income tax – but income taxes are paid basically on a one-year lag basis.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Right.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: In other words, your current year's taxes is essentially based on your earnings from the
prior year. But what's happening to the government today is because we're incurring 100% of the cost and selling half
or less of our concentrates, the taxable income is shrinking and so the government's tax take of that which is payable
next year...
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Right.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: ...is being reduced.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: They would have thought...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Accounting purposes, as you know well because you follow this, I think more closely
than anyone else, we accrue for the tax expense based on our current income recognition, not when the taxes are paid.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Right. Okay. Thanks. And just last question and again, just like Oscar being a mining
guy. Just on Eagle Ford, it obviously had a very good first quarter. You've revised up your guidance a little bit for this
year. If I look at it in simple terms, it looks like it's a pretty fast decline rate going forward to get to your averages for
the year. Is that because you're harvesting that aggressively for cash or is that just something went better than expected
in the first quarter or how should I think about that going forward?
<A - James C. Flores>: I think a little bit of both. I mean, obviously we reduced our rig count from nine rigs two and a
half years to two rigs, and what that means obviously is less completions in the future. We've been managing that
completion inventory, at the same point in time, the wells have performed better overall in the field. So therefore it's
slowing that decline rate because they're staying at higher production rates earlier on in their lives. So as we go
forward, the production rates are probably a little conservative going forward and we'll probably be adjusting those
later this year as we get a little more time on those curves and feel like we can feel good about projecting – giving you
tighter projections, but right now the field continues to outperform on all fronts.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thank you, Brian. And listen thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Jim Bob.

I want to make just a couple of comments. We've had so many questions on Indonesia. Let's get frank for just a
moment. In 1998, President Suharto stepped down. Prior to that, you had over 70 years with President Sukarno and
Suharto, no changes in political landscape. Since the 1998 departure of President Suharto, you've had a series of events.
You've had Habibie, who took over for Suharto. And then you've gone from Habibie to [ph] Abdurrahman Wahid
(1:52:18) which was an appointed President. And then Megawati, basically an appointed President. And then you had
SBY [Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono] And SBY had two terms. This is the first time in over 80 years that there's ever
been term limits.
In other words, a lame duck administration. So the next President, which is going to be elected by the people in July
and going forward is important, because there will be a possibility if the President has the two terms, of 12 years of a
President. And remember every time you change your President, you change the Cabinet, and that means you change
philosophy. So this has been an interesting time in the development of the Indonesian society, both politically and
socioeconomic. So I think it's important to spend a moment on that and realize that all of this dilemma about export tax
and changing regulations, hopefully, once the new President is elected and the new Cabinet is put in place, there'll be,
potentially as I say for a two-term President, then things would be a lot more predictable than it has been in the last few
years since 1998, and that's just a matter of fact.
So, we've been working in Indonesia for a long time and Indonesia honors contracts. And at the end of the day, the
Contract of Work and the mineral law of 2009. There's a lot of legal things that we haven't spent a whole lot of time,
because it takes so much time to understand them on this call but there is contracts in place, and as I say, possibly a
long-term government to deal with them. So we'll get there, and we appreciate everybody's patience.
Richard C. Adkerson
