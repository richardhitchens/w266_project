Last night, we issued our press release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter 2013 and posted a
slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are available on our website. Referring to
our first slide, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results
may differ materially from those statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2012 and our most recent press release for
information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are
reconciliations in our press release and on our website. We're recording this call and a replay will be available
following its conclusion. I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.
Now, let's begin with Tom Wilson. Tom?
Thomas J. Wilson
Well, good morning. We appreciate your interest in Allstate. I'll cover our results for the first quarter relative to our
strategy and our priorities for 2013, then Bob and Steve will provide more color on the business results, investments in
capital and, of course, we have our entire management team here to answer any questions you have.
First quarter operating financial results reflect our progress in executing our strategy to create both sustainable and
profitable growth. As you know, Allstate's strategy is to serve the four unique consumer segments with competitively
differentiated products and services. So, if you go to Slide 2, we show the high level results for the four consumer
segments. The three brands where we underwrite risks, that being Allstate, Encompass and Esurance, all generated net
written premium growth over prior year in the first quarter, while Answer Financial grew its non-proprietary premium.
In the consumer segment served by the Allstate brand, that's customers that prefer local advice in presence and branded
products in the lower left, units continued to decline as expected, largely reflecting efforts to improve the homeowners
returns. We did have an increase over the prior year quarter in new business for standard auto. This is primarily the
result of new pricing tactics and improved agency productivity. Standard auto retention also increased. Profitability
remains strong as we've matched rate increases with loss cost trends for auto and homeowners. As a result, margins
stayed at levels achieved at the end of last year.
Encompass, which serves the advice-seeking brand neutral customers, that's in the upper left, grew net written
premiums 7.2% and units 6.1% over the first quarter of 2012 on the strength of its unique package policy and increased
engagement of independent agencies. Profitability is not at target levels, but reflecting the runoff of the non-package
auto business. And then, we also have some work to do on pricing underwriting in the package auto, although the
combined ratio there is below 100.
Esurance, which serves as self-directed branded consumer segment, that's the lower right, continue to produce excellent
growth results with net written premiums of 30% and units up over 36% from a year ago. The combined ratio of 116.7
remains elevated as we invest in marketing to acquire profitable lifetime value customers. These results demonstrate
that our strategy of providing differentiated products and services to unique customer segments is working.
We had a solid quarter in terms of operating results as shown on slide 3. On a consolidated basis we produced net
income of $709 million and operating income of $647 million, both were less than the first quarter of 2012 due to
higher catastrophe losses this year. The underlying property-liability combined ratio of 87.7 was 0.4 points better than
the first quarter of 2012 and slightly better than our full year 2013 outlook range of 88 to 90. Book value per diluted
share increased 12.7% from a year ago. Returns on net and operating income were 11.3% and 11.9%, respectively.
Over the last earnings call, we talked about we have five operating priorities for 2013, as is shown on the bottom, as to
grow insurance premiums, maintain auto profitability, raise returns in homeowners and annuities, proactively manage
investments and reduce our cost structure. The results from the first quarter are on pace to achieve those objectives.
Now I've already covered the premium growth of property-liability and Allstate Financial, premiums and contract
charges increased 4.7% over prior year with Allstate Benefits realizing 11.8% growth in the quarter. We also made
progress on our second goal of maintaining auto margins. The Allstate brand's standard auto combined ratio for the first
quarter was 94.2, that's one point better than the prior year, and the underlying combined ratio was 93.5, that's 1.4

points better than the first quarter of 2012. The overall auto combined ratio was 96.1.
We continued to raise returns from the homeowners business with an Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio of
85.1, despite over 18 points catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was improved 1.2 points year-over-year,
that's to 65.8. Now, it is pretty close to where we ended last year's fourth quarter. Annuity returns declined in the first
quarter due to reduced limit of partnership income and continued low interest rate. Raising annuity returns remains a
challenge particularly given this low interest rate environment.
Proactively managing investment portfolio is our fourth goal. We had total return of 1.2% for the quarter. We also sold
long bonds in the property-liability portfolio to reduce our exposure to higher interest rates. Continued low interest
rates and these risk reduction strategies will reduce net investment income as we move throughout the year.
We added a fifth priority this year, to reduce our cost structure. The expense ratio was up this quarter, reflecting
accelerated investments in technology and a restructuring charge for future employee reductions.
Finally, there have been a couple of articles written about Lincoln Benefit Life, which comprises about one-third of
Allstate Financial's total reserves and is one of several legal entities providing proprietary life and annuity products
through Allstate agencies. Lincoln Benefit also serves consumers that are advice-seeking and brand-neutral through
independent agencies, which is at upper left in our four-quadrant market segmentation. As you know, and would
expect, our practice is not to comment on these rumors.
Let me turn it over to Bob.
Robert Block
Thanks, Tom. In the first quarter on a consolidated basis, we generated $709 million and $647 million in net and
operating income respectively, shown on the top of slide 4. These results were less than the first quarter of 2012 as we
recorded more catastrophe losses this quarter. Property-liability recorded $616 million in net income, $79 million less
than the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the higher level of catastrophe losses this quarter. Earned premium of
$6.77 billion increased 2.1% over the prior year with recorded combined ratio of 93.2, including 5.3 points of
catastrophe losses.
The $100 million increase in recorded catastrophe losses in the quarter was driven by lower favorable prior year reserve
re-estimates this year versus the first quarter of 2012. The underlying combined ratio was 87.7, four-tenths of a point
lower than the prior year and slightly less than the full year 2013 outlook of 88 to 90. Allstate Financial net income was
$146 million in first quarter of 2013, up $34 million or 30.4% from prior year as you can see in the top of the slide.
This was driven by realized capital gains this year versus realized capital losses last year in the first quarter 2012.
Operating income of $144 million was slightly less than the first quarter 2012 as investment spread declined which was
partially offset by an increase in the benefit spread.
Now, we'll review our performance on our operating priorities for 2013 that Tom just discussed. The first quarter saw
real progress on our priority of growing insurance premiums. On slide 5, total property-liability net written premium
was $6.6 billion, grew 2.5% from the first quarter of 2012, with all of the brands contributing to this positive result.
Total policies in force of $32.8 million declined slightly from year-end 2012 and 0.7% from March of 2012. This figure
excludes 1.1 million Good Hands Roadside members, which is almost double the membership as of March 2012.
Within the Allstate brand, standard auto net written premium was up 1.2%. While units declined, the rate of decline
slowed in the quarter and we experienced increases from the first quarter of 2012 in new issued applications of 7.3%,
and retention of six-tenths of a point to 89.3%. We continue to see great changes as appropriate, introducing new
pricing structures in products like Drive Wise into the marketplace. Allstate brand homeowners also recorded a small
increase in net written premium, while units declined as expected albeit at a slower rate. Net written premium increases
were recorded in our emerging businesses, Canada, Encompass and Insurance – Esurance. Canada, Encompass and
Esurance also had increases in unit growth from prior year.

We maintained auto profitability in the first quarter of 2013 with the standard auto recorded combined ratio of 96.1, 1.2
points better than the first quarter of 2012. This result includes all three brands. On slide 6, we provide some details for
the Allstate brand standard auto, which represents about 90% of the earned premium for this line.
The trend in gross frequencies for bodily injury and property damage are shown in the upper left. Both coverages
recorded declines in the quarter from prior year. In the upper right, the trend for calendar year paid severities for bodily
injury and property damage are displayed. Property damage declined 1% year-over-year. Bodily injury increased 7.4%,
a result heavily influenced by the timing of payments and geographic mix. Adjusting for these two factors, the
underlying severity trend for bodily injury is in line with CPI growth.
When you include all the coverages in auto, the chart in the lower left shows the underlying loss trend improving from
the first quarter 2012, while average earned premium continued to increase as we benefit from approved rate changes.
The result was a consistently favorable combined ratio trend, shown in the lower right. We continually – we continued
to successfully maintain auto profitability.
Raising returns in homeowners is an important goal. Slide 7 provides details on our progress in achieving this priority,
specifically for Allstate brand homeowners. The underlying combined ratio was 65.8, 1.2 points better than the prior
year with a recorded combined ratio of 85.1. Lost cause trends remained relatively benign with gross frequency
increasing slightly while paid severity declined. The underlying margin trends continued to improve as shown in the
chart on the lower left. The chart on the lower right shows the continued improvement in the underlying combined ratio
since mid-2011. We will continue to seek rate changes as necessary, utilize underwriting techniques to improve the
quality of the book, roll out the new House & Home product to more markets, and broker business in higher risk
markets where appropriate.
Raising returns in annuities remains a challenge as the low investment results continue to pressure returns. Shown on
slide 8, contractor holder funds declined as we continue to shift away from spread-based products. Operating income
return on attributed equity for Allstate Financial declined slightly from year-end 2012 due to higher net capital levels
and lower operating income. The decline in the return for immediate annuities reflects lower investment income from
limited partnerships.
Now let me turn it over to Steve to talk about investments and capital.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, Bob. First quarter investment results reflect strategic actions focused on balancing income, risk and return in
the current low interest and uncertain economic environment. In the first quarter, we continued rate risk reduction
actions in our property-liability portfolio, maintained alignment with Allstate Financial's changing liability profile, and
began repositioning our public equity portfolio from a passive to a more targeted strategy.
On slide 9, you see the carrying value of our total portfolio ended the first quarter at $97.4 billion, a slight increase over
year-end. Core debt, which includes fixed income, securities and loans, represents the vast majority of our portfolio.
We continued to increase the equity and owned component of our portfolio, including limited partnerships, real estate,
public equities and other alternative assets. We expect these assets to generate higher returns over time; however,
earnings from these assets will be more variable on a quarterly basis.
Net investment income totaled $983 million in the first quarter, and total portfolio yield was 4.5%, representing
declines from both the prior quarter and first quarter of 2012. The magnitude of the decline was mitigated somewhat by
income related to bond calls and mortgage loans repaid at a premium, as well as litigation proceeds, which added an
aggregate of $42 million to net investment income.
Turning to the total portfolio return chart. We had a positive return of 1.2% for the first quarter, with net investment
income the primary driver. Valuation and price changes contributed less than in prior-year quarters as an uptick in
interest rates was substantially offset by tighter credit spreads, moderating returns on the core debt portfolio. Equity and
owned investments contributed to the total return through income from partnerships, equity dividends and increases in

valuations.
Slide 10 depicts the dynamics and impact of the different investment strategies we are employing for the Allstate
Protection and Allstate Financial business units. As mentioned previously, during the first quarter we continued to
reduce interest rate risk in our property-liability portfolio, positioning it to be less sensitive to a rise in interest rates by
targeting a shorter maturity profile. This repositioning involves shifting out of longer-term municipal and corporate
bonds and shorter-term lower-yielding treasuries into intermediate term bonds as shown in the scheduled maturity
graph in the upper right. The sale of longer-term higher-yielding securities pulls forward future income through the
realization of gains.
As you can see in the graph in the top left, the earned yield on our property-liability core debt portfolio has been
declining and was 3.3% for the first quarter of 2013. The current yield at intermediate corporates, our targeted
reinvestment proxy, is approximately 1.3%. Given this differential, maturity and sales activities have and will continue
to result in a decline in net investment income for core debt.
For Allstate Financial, you can see at the bottom of the page that both net investment income and the portfolio have
declined as a result of the managed reduction of spread-based liabilities. The majority of investment cash flows have
been used to fund liability outflows rather than being reinvested, so the portfolio yield has not been impacted as much
as with the property-liability portfolio. Future investment income will depend on the pace of the liability outflows and
reinvestment activity.
Looking forward, there are three factors influencing our investment income arising from the market environment and
investment strategies we have put in place since the financial crisis. First, the yield on our core debt portfolio – this is
trending down as proceeds from maturities and the shortening of the property-liability maturity profile are reinvested at
current lower rates. Second, income related to market refinancing activity such as bond calls and mortgage loan
prepayments, as well as litigation settlements, may be significantly lower or may not recur in the future. And third,
limited partnership investments, which offer attractive long-term returns, but with income which may vary significantly
from quarter to quarter.
For the first quarter, income on the core debt portfolio continued to decline as we expected, given maturities and rate
risk reduction, while the other two items were at the high end of recent quarterly experience. To provide a better
understanding of these trends, we added analysis on pages 42 and 47 to the investor supplement to create more
transparency of our investment results.
Slide 11 shows our capital position at the end of the first quarter of 2013. We remain a strong capital position, with
shareholders' equity of $20.6 billion comparable to year-end 2012. Statutory surplus remained at $17.2 billion and
deployable assets at the holding company level increased to $2.7 billion. Our book value per diluted share increased
12.7% from March 2012, and 2.5% from year-end 2012.
We repurchased 14.3 million shares of our stock in the quarter, 5.1 million shares in the open market and 9.2 million
shares under a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. We have $1.33 billion remaining in our share
repurchase programs. Our operating ROE was 11.9% on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6.9 points from a year ago but
down half a point from year-end. The drop from year-end reflects both higher average capital and a lower first quarter
operating income compared to first quarter last year.
We are off to a good start in 2013. Our first quarter results are solid. And we continue to execute effectively on our
consumer-focused strategy and our 2013 operating priorities.
Now let's open it up for your questions.

Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your question, please?
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you, and good morning. For the underlying combined ratio of 87.7 in the first quarter
already being below or better than the outlook for the full year 2013. Is there any reason that you think that that's not
able to continue?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Good morning, Jay. This is Tom. We still feel comfortable with 88 to 90. That's a full year
number. That's one quarter. A lot of the quarters bounce around just because of weather, but we're still comfortable
with 88 to 90.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. And then turning to the contribution from investment income, on slide 10 of the
presentation, I know there were a couple potential one-time items in there, including bond call premiums. It would be
helpful from our perspective to get what you view as sort of the run rate of the property-liability and Allstate Financial
quarterly investment income?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, let me make a couple of comments about that run rate. And then Steve and Judy might
want to jump in. First, we prefer not to give sort of line-by-line projections for the P&L, although I recognize that this
is a more difficult one in this environment to get your arms around particularly as you look at this quarter. So, as you
point out, we had a couple – some of it is prepays which are a little hard to forecast, bounce around a little bit. We also
had some litigation settlements. You might remember about a year and a half ago, we made a little bit of press by filing
suits against a number of issuers of mortgage-backed securities, and we've started to settle some of those. So those
really are truly nonrecurring, and really reflect just an offset to losses we had in prior years. And then limited
partnership returns bounce around. Steve, you – or Judy might want to talk about limited partnership returns and then
what's happening with the core portfolio.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: So, Jay, we did – as Steve said, we did add the two pages in the sup, and I think that those
will be helpful in terms of distinguishing between the core portfolio and the equity portfolio. So you can see in that, on
that page, what's happened in both. I think it's key to see that the – that as we reinvested in the lower rates, done the risk
reduction in the property-liability portfolio for interest rates, that the core earnings on that portfolio, the core yield, has
come down and will continue to come down. As Steve mentioned, the differential between the core portfolio yield and
what we're reinvesting at is about 200 basis points. So that will continue to happen. I think it's also helpful to look at the
upper right-hand side of page 10 of the presentation that Steve just went through, and it goes through the progress that
we've made and the risk reduction, and I think that also helps give you an indication of what we've done so far. And as
we've said, we're going to continue to sell some longer-dated maturity securities and reinvest in the intermediate
portion of the curve.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Understood. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Michael Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your first question?
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Hi. Thanks. I guess as a follow-up to the last question, so I think I heard Steve mention a
1.3% new money yield on the core debt portfolio in the property-liability portfolio. If I heard that correctly, then what
do you guys think about the new money rate for the Allstate Financial core debt portfolio?
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: So for Allstate Financial, it's a little bit different because we're managing to match the
liabilities, and there we're – in that portfolio it's more of a seven- to 10-year proxy. So, on the property-liability we gave
you a three- to five-year proxy, and on Allstate Financial it's seven to 10.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay. Okay, great. Okay, then I had a couple of questions about the capital backing the
life insurance subsidiaries. I noticed the RBC ratio at year-end 2012 was up to the higher 300s from the previous year,
and I was curious if we should expect any dividends out from there. And I also noticed in the 10-Q some talk about a
$500 million advance between the subsidiary and the hold co. Thank you.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: First, you remember we did put a bunch of money into the life insurance company over the
last couple of years, and their goal is to return some of that money to us. Some of that will come through surplus notes.
Some of it we'd like to come through dividends, and we have to work through some statutory accounting issues to get
that done. So the inter-company loan was really just a way for us to get higher returns on $500 million of capital. It
wasn't needed for capital purposes; it was simply a way for us to move money into a better returning asset. That's all.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay. And would you be able to tell us how much capital's backing the spread-based
annuities books?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: There should be some attributed equity in the investor supplement, Mike.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay. And then lastly, if I could slip one in, a lot of disclosure on the reinsurance
program. It sounds like you guys are expecting lower reinsurance costs for the year if I'm correct. Are you basically
buying less coverage because there's less exposure, or are you taking on more – a little more risk? Thank you.
<A - Samuel Henry Pilch>: This is Sam Pilch. In the 10-Q, we explained several things that have gone on with respect
to the placement of our reinsurance and the effect on cost. First thing was we did – we no longer needed to place a
seventh layer, which we did last year and the reason for that is that we were able to achieve our targeted risk retention
goals without that layer. Secondly, the benefit of the CAT BOND placement helped to reduce the costs. We also are
expecting that we're going to place a smaller program in Florida. We'll be doing that later in the quarter – that'll reduce
our total cost. And then finally, the year-to-year pricing on the program has come down. So those are the four reasons
that we've cited.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Can we take the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks. Just a couple questions I guess. First off, on the homeowners line, I guess a question
of how much rate are you getting right now, if you could just kind of ballpark it? I'm just wondering when should we
start to see that translate into premium growth? We've talked in the past about de-risking efforts there. Where – can we
revisit where that is and when you – when we feel like you're comfortable with the book you have and then it's just
about growing top line or pushing rate through on the retained book? And just one follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Hey, Michael. It's Matt Winter.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Hey, Matt.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: You got a couple of questions embedded in there. So at a high level, let me start with
where we are in the homeowners book. We have done a substantial amount of work on improving the profitability in
returns of that business. We now have House and Home in just about 22 states, making it available to just over half of
the U.S. population. That product goes in immediately rate adequate. We've also had rating actions and if you look in
the sup, I believe it's pages 14 and 25 in the sup, you can see the history of our rate taking actions. It has slowed. It has
slowed in the last couple of quarters as we get closer to being rate adequate. We're not quite done. And we're
addressing it not just through rate but through some continued underwriting actions.
So although the vast majority of the non-renewals in the re-inspection program has had its impact, there is still some
additional work to do. As you notice, while we've been doing that, we've managed to ramp up new business. So, new
business is up just about 12% in the quarter and that's continued improvement over the second half of 2012. We were
about flat in the third quarter of 2012. Fourth quarter we were about 5.8% up in new business and this year, 11.9%.
And we're actually growing new business in 33 states compared to 14 a year ago. Retention takes a little longer to work
on given the fact that these are 12-month policies and given the fact that some of the profitability and rating actions and

underwriting actions have an impact, some collateral damage on retention, and so that hasn't moved as quickly as new
business.
We're hoping that as our rating actions and underwriting actions soften and as we get closer to the final point of our
profitability, the retention will start to pick up. We have a huge amount of effort underway on customer experience and
retention. We know it's a key lever not only in the homeowners business but also in the auto business. So, the short
answer to your question is, we're not done yet with all of the profitability actions. But we have made substantial
progress and we're trying to coordinate the turn by getting new business ramped up quickly. So as we get more rate
adequate and as the underwriting actions soften and decrease, we'll be in the great position to start growing.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. Thank you very much. And then, Tom, you mentioned the expense ratio upfront. You
talked about some restructuring actions. Can you give a little more detail on how to think about the year-over-year and
what aspects of the expense ratio are more go forward? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, you have to break the expense ratio into a bunch of different pieces, right. So there's
the Allstate brand expense ratio which is that which we deploy in that lower left-hand quadrant. That was up a little bit,
we got a little ahead on technology spend. I would expect that to come down a little bit as we move through the year.
The Esurance expense ratio is high and it stays high as long as we think the acquisition costs are a better – good trade
for the lifetime value of the policy. But in general, we're looking at just about everything we have to try to reduce costs.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. And then, I think you mentioned a change in compensation structure for agents' bonus
and commission. Can you elaborate a bit on that?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Sure. Matt can talk about that. I may put it in a broad, multi-year context and Matt can talk
specifically about that. Over the last three years, we've been working hard to strengthen our Allstate agencies and the
distribution platform and we did it at a time when we knew that we'd be backing off some on volumes because of what
we were doing in the homeowners business. So we've done everything from change performance standards and work
with those agencies who are not going be successful to leave the system to helping those successful agencies buy other
agencies and build those agencies up, to deploying technology for them, to changing the compensation structure so that
it aligned with our customer-focused strategy. So it's been a multi-year effort, and we feel good about where it's coming
out. There are obviously – anytime you make that broad and deep a change, it takes – there's a few bumps in the road.
Matt can talk specifically about the compensation program.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thank you.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure. We – as Tom mentioned, so we had a fairly substantial set of changes in our overall
agent compensation program. We implemented a variable compensation piece. We implemented a new annual bonus
structure, and we implemented a set of measures designed to create a different type of an agency system consistent with
our new customer value proposition. So, rather than being single product focused, it is now more representative of the
type of customer experience we'd like our agencies to provide, so they will get compensated better when they sell the
full portfolio of products, when they pay attention to household bundling and household penetration, when they pay
attention to customer experience and achieve great customer experience. They have compensation incentives in place
for that. And their representation of the brand all the way from physical presence of their agencies to their level of
continuing education and their representation of multiple products.
So this past year was really the first full year of implementation for both the variable comp piece and the annual bonus
piece. It appears to be doing what we wanted it to do. It's driving the behaviors we want. We were surprised, and
pleasantly surprised, to see the success of most of our agencies in making that turn. It's really difficult to respond to a
new compensation system when you're running a small business and you've built cash flow projections and your
business plan in a certain way. But I think our agency owners did a phenomenal job adapting to the new system,
reorienting their business, redoing their business plans. And they maximized their compensation and did exceptionally
well last year, and so any reference you may have seen may have been to the fact that we had a good payout last year
on the annual bonus, and we have a high percentage of people making the variable comp, and in fact, a substantial
percentage making more now as a result of enhanced customer experience.

Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney. Your question, please?
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Good morning, everyone. I appreciate the increased disclosure on slide 47, but I'm going
be greedy and ask for a little bit more transparency on partnerships. My understanding is that you have a one-quarter
lag so the good, strong stock market in Q1 is likely going to provide a headwind into Q2. And I'm just wondering how
we should think about the mix of partnership assets and if there's a macro portfolio we should look at and an overall
core to the strategy of what you're trying to do with your partnership investing?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, good morning, Bob. This is Tom. You've always been known to ask for more, and
Judy will attempt to give that to you.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: Thanks, Tom. So, Bob, in the limited partnership results there are a couple of things. First of
all, there are private equity – traditional private equity returns and that you can look at that and see some correlation to
the broader S&P, and you can apply a beta to that. And you're right, when the – we do report on a quarter lag, and when
the S&P does well, those valuations tend to do well. The second piece is real estate, which is a little bit tougher to align
to the S&P, but it also tends to do well in this type of environment, with lower rates and a lot of demand for real estate.
The third piece, which has come down significantly over the past couple of years, is our hedge fund exposure, which is
almost nonexistent at this point. So we've basically replaced that with private equity and private real estate, and we're
also looking at increasing our investments and infrastructure in real assets. That's a little bit slower than we'd like
because a lot of people are looking for those types of assets, but we still think that those offer value as well.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Thank you. Anything unusual in the expense ratio that's bumped up? Is there more
advertise spend? Or is that a trend line we can expect to continue? Perhaps it's Esurance in the mix?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: No, Bob, the only thing that's unusual, our technology expenses were a little ahead of plan
in the first quarter, and we took a charge for future employee reductions.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Any sense on how many bps above normal those things represent?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We're not going to give that out, no.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Sure.

Our next question is from Gregory Locraft of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on Glass's question regarding the limited partnerships. You
guys, I think, have some footnotes in the supplement that talk about about $2 billion of commitments or future –
anticipated future purchases of limited partnerships. First off, is – am I reading that footnote correctly? And then what
is the timing around that and that represents a 40% increase in the LP allocation. So, how's that going to impact just net
investment income dollars going forward for the corporation?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Greg, This time Judy will give you the specifics. But remember those commitments, we
sign up to a fund. And those commitments are drawn down as you would expect over a long period of time. And at the
same time, as those commitments are being drawn down, we're getting cash from our existing investments.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: So, it is about $2 billion and about $1 billion of it is set aside for Allstate Protection or the
property-liability business and about $1 billion for Allstate Financial. And as Tom said, it's just a draw-down over

several years versus the commitment. And what we find is, though, that it's not dollar-per-dollar increase of what we
currently have because what we currently have will pay down over time as well. So, by the time we fund those other
investments in our current portfolio, we'll likely have already been realized.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Okay. That's helpful. So it's not going be a 40% jump in this part of the portfolio? It's going
be much smaller, given what you just said?
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: I guess I would say that we are trying to grow this part of the portfolio. Yet, the 40% likely
won't happen because of what I just talked about.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Perfect. Okay. Great. And then last it's just, you had mentioned you want to own some more
infrastructure and real assets. Should we think about this as a pro-rata slice of the existing allocation? Or is it all maybe
going towards that or the infrastructure funds or something else?
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: There again we're trying to grow it as I said. But it's more difficult because there are lots of
demands for those assets. So it's not – we continue to allocate to private equity and real estate as well. So, pro-rata is
not too far off with the way to think about it.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Our next question's from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital. Your question, please?
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Hi. Good morning. I guess my first, Tom, is I know there's been a lot focus on the
homeowners' improvement. But arguably the auto progress has been just as impressive, given many of your peers have
struggled to maintain margins as severities spike and you've been able to improve it. I know you talked a little bit about
it in the past. Can you just give a little more color, I mean, do you feel comfortable – what sort of gives you confidence
that you can maintain auto margins if severity remains elevated at these levels?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, first, thank you for the recommendation. Matt is smiling quite broadly here. We're –
we think we're pretty good at the auto business. We pay a lot of attention to it. We have a culture and a set of operating
practices and organization structures that ensure that, that keeps going. So we're a little paranoid about it. Matt can talk
specifically about some of the underlying trends in the big states and the things that he's watching to give you a sense
for sustainability. But I would say that it is a – as you know, one of our core objectives has always been to maintain
auto profitability while we start to get the business growing again.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Yeah, it's Matt. Thank you both for the question and for the comment. As Tom said, a lot
of our ability to manage this has to do with the systems we've set up and have been set up over the years here, to be
very proactive on the auto business and watch emerging trends. A lot of that has to do with a fairly decentralized
product organization that is focused down at the sub-state level on geographies and local markets to watch emerging
trends. And a lot of it also has to do with the feedback loop with our claims organization to product where the claims
personnel are really monitoring trends, very quickly reporting on them and enabling us to stay out in front of it. We see
that most evidently in some of the larger states.
You see what's happening to New York and Florida. We feel pretty good about what's happened there. We've done –
that team has done a phenomenal job paying attention in very, very difficult environments, as you're aware. And we
manage the loss ratios both holistically and by individual component. So it's easy to get trapped in either of the two,
either looking at loss ratio and not looking at the individual components, or getting so focused on BI paid severity or
PD paid severity that you don't look at the overall context and the overall loss ratio. And so we've set up a structure
where we're looking at it in multi dimensions and we're watching the emerging trends and we're trying to stay ahead of
our loss trends.
Yet, at the same time, we're very focused on optimizing between growth and profitability. We think that we're seeing
some really encouraging trends on the growth side. We have – we saw some great overall growth in new business. This

quarter we had 29 states showing positive growth in the quarter where – the retention is also up, with about 32 states
improved in the first quarter. So the more we focus on our ability to maintain our existing customers and improve their
customer experience and get the new business engine growing again, while we maintain the profitability awareness,
and focus, we think it's setting the stage for a dynamic business.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: So we have the same culture in the other businesses; it's executed a little differently. So if I
could get Don Bailey to talk about Encompass and Don Civgin to talk about Esurance.
<A - Donald J. Bailey>: Particularly on the growth side, Tom?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: No, on the combined ratio of auto insurance.
<A - Donald J. Bailey>: So on the auto combined piece – this is Don Bailey – on Encompass. If you look at our
overall plan for Encompass you can see sustained growth on a top line basis, which we're excited about. As Tom said in
his opening comments, we're not where we need to be from a profitability perspective. If you break down the auto
piece of that for us, what you'll note is that our package auto business represents about 73% of the total gross premium
we've got in that space, in the segment business. The mono-line auto is about 27%. The profitability pressures we have
are clearly in the mono-line segment auto space. Our package auto business operates below 100 as Tom said. From a
growth perspective, we are significantly growing the package auto piece of what we do, and we are significantly
shrinking that piece of it that is mono-line. So we've got a plan for profitability in the auto space in Encompass. We're
executing that plan, and we're getting there as quickly as we responsibly can.
<A - Don Civgin>: And then as it relates to Esurance, we've owned Esurance for about a year and a half now. Feel
really good about where we are with them. Not only are they living into the strategy of serving their unique customer
with unique products and services, but they're generating strong growth with the PIP up about 36% over last year and
the premiums up over 30%. The combined ratio is high. We are – we expected that. We're okay with it. We have had a
lot of work done with respect to making sure their loss ratios are in line and you can see that coming down from where
it's been running over the back half of last year. So feel good about that and confident that that'll be a strong contributor
in the future. And then – and we've discussed before, their advertising model's different. So because they are growing
so fast and spending a lot of money on advertising, we are forced to expense that up front, which makes their
short-term loss ratio, GAAP loss ratio, look quite high. We are running this on an economic basis.
So we look at the lifetime economic combined ratio, which we monitor continuously. We feel good that we're writing
profitable business. GAAP results tend to skew that, so it'll look less profitable at the beginning and more profitable in
the future. And in a high-growth environment, that doesn't look as attractive. But we're feeling good about the business
they're writing, love the fact that it's growing, and as I said, at the end of the day it's fulfilling its strategic objective.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Got it. That was all exceptionally helpful. I could probably ask about six follow-ups but I'll
limit myself to one. Matt, on the growth in new business you mentioned, can you just give us any more color as far as I
know you talked about states and so forth. But is there any – is it certain types of customers that are growing differently
than another or certain risk characteristics, or is it mono-line versus bundled? Any kind of maybe customer segment
that's leading that a little bit more than others?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure. Well, remember, I talked about it probably the last two earnings calls that two
initiatives that we had under way with the auto business, that we've termed price optimization and broadening the
target. And essentially, what the intent of both of those initiatives was to do was to slightly expand our target market.
We have been very selective in our target market. But we were – we had a very attractive rate for a fairly small group
of people, and we wanted to, consistent with our risk profile and our underwriting rigor, expand that a little bit. And so
we have broadened that target market a little bit. Still well within what we believe is the preferred type of risk that we
want as a company. And consistent with that and some of the cross-line sales and discounts for multi-line, we are
seeing a broadening of that target. We're seeing a larger group of people who are finding us attractive. They tend to be
very profitable.
They tend to bring a need for other products with them. It's a pretty broad-based improvement and what's interesting is
that the new business trends that are up and the retention trends that are up, are up in those states where we have

implemented those two initiatives; the price optimization and broadening the target. So we're seeing them provide the
lift that we expected and we're seeing that continue to rollout as we finish installing those tweaks to the rating plan
across the country. So overall it's a slight broadening. Not a dramatically different market but a disciplined move to
expand our target market to include a greater percentage of people who shop with us.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: To all of our participants. I know it's a busy day for you. We've got a number of people with
questions, so if you could give us your most important question, we'll then commit to try to get through as many of

Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore. Your question, please?
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Hi. Good morning. Just a question on the change in the compensation structure for the
agencies – if I recall that did result in a few agents leaving. Just curious where we are in the process, are we seeing the
pace of agents leaving decline?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Vinay, this is Tom Wilson. I'm not sure I agree with your premise that people left because
of the compensation program. People choose there – where to put their professional efforts based on what they think
their ability succeed is. Obviously that includes compensation but it also includes your own skills, capabilities and their
own view of what they want to do in their life. So I wouldn't attribute the decline in agencies to the compensation plan.
I would say that our agencies have been going down over the last couple of years. But if you – the other thing to look at
is a number of licensed sales producers. So which is really more important is how many people do we have out there
selling. Matt might want to make a comment about I think – what I would say is if you're really getting at where the
agents heads. Matt might want to make a comment about agency productivity.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Yes.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure. Sure. Let me try to answer it this way. The underlying premise to your question is
that historically, over the last year or two we saw a decline in some of the agent population. And is that continuing or is
that slowing? And I would say first, not all of that was unintended. We had some expected attrition during that period
as we were shifting and trying to get to a more productive agency for us. I would say much like the comments I made
about homeowners and other efforts, the vast majority of that is behind us. We've seen agencies prove that they can be
very effective with our new structure, with our new compensation structure, with our new sport model and with our
new customer value proposition.
So we are seeing a stabilization of agency numbers and, as Tom mentioned, we have a large initiative underway to not
only grow the number of agencies but to grow the number of licensed sales professionals, which is working quite well
right now. We are seeing net positive growth in many states and we have a series of things we are rolling out to
improve the recruiting selection and training and development of those licensed sales professionals and provide
additional support to them and enable them to be as successful as we have been focused on for our agency owners.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: That's helpful. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, on the reinsurance purchases, have you
considered buying more reinsurance to reduce the volatility on the homeowner side since pricing is low right now?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Vinay, thanks for your question. I'll point out it's not really a follow-up.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Sorry.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I would ask our next people – I do want to try to get through everybody.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Sure.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We're always looking at reinsurance and the right way to shed risk or to keep risk in what's
economic and we're comfortable where we're at.

Our next question's from Josh Stirling of Bernstein. Your question?
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Hi. Hi. Thank you for fitting me in. So on Esurance, obviously big uptick in growth in
the quarter, sequentially helpful. Wondering what you've learned over the past year and if there's any couple of specific
things you're doing now that's leading to the acceleration of gross. And then it's not a follow-up but really related. Is
there a target, a GAAP-combined ratio target that we should be thinking about as your sort of short-term operating goal
for Esurance as we look out over the next year or two? Thanks so much.
<A - Don Civgin>: Josh, it's Don Civgin. What I would attribute Esurance's success to thus far is the fact that in a very
thoughtful way, they focus on what the customer value proposition they're building is. So when you look at their set of
features and services that they provide to their customers, they're really quite cutting edge. So first of all, they have a
really strong offering for their particular customer segment. Second, I think the affiliation with the Allstate brand with
Esurance and Allstate Company has played very strongly in the market. That was always something that was a barrier
for them from a conversion retention point of view. And the affiliation with the brand Allstate has helped them, I think,
substantially. And I think the third thing is their advertising campaign, their marketing efforts have been quite
successful. And so when I look at kind of the whole result that we're seeing, not only are we seeing growth, we're
seeing as a result of the advertising, we're seeing better conversion as you can tell from the reports. We're seeing better
retention. And they're getting a better mix of customer. And so with prior insurance and so forth.
So we're feeling good that there are good solid reasons for why they're performing the way they are. The only thing I'd
add on that is, and this is important, Esurance is getting its growth not from Allstate customers. So we monitor it very
closely. And Esurance is taking market share from competitors. There's no transfer between our brands. They're just
quite honestly winning in that customer segment and we feel good about it. As it relates to the target, combined ratio,
we would target an economic combined ratio and then decide how flexible we can be on the GAAP-combined ratio
because as I said before, we're running this on an economic basis. So I would tell you we don't necessarily have a target
GAAP ratio. So as long as the business we're building is good, solid, profitable business we're happy with it.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Got it. Thanks so much.

Our next question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please?
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Thank you. And I appreciate you going a little long today. I was looking at the repurchase and
maybe I don't understand a few things. It looks like on the accelerated share repurchase, I guess you're through $444
million of $0.5 billion. Am I thinking about that correctly? That means you've paid about $48.25 per share, it seems a
little expensive to me given where the stock traded this quarter. Maybe I don't understand how this works, if you can
explain it a little bit.
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So, Josh, we bought back, in the open market for the first couple months of the quarter, a
couple hundred million dollars of shares and then we pre-funded $500 million in this accelerated program and received
9.2 million shares back. We will settle that at the end of that program. And pay either in more shares or they will
hopefully pay us some additional shares or we will pay them a few shares to settle out the deal. If you look at the – both
the earnings release and the 10-Q we have that broken out for you. I'm not sure about the $444 million.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Well, I was just saying you guys said you were through $1.33 billion and $226 million plus
$1.33 billion leaves me at $1.5 billion?

<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So what that is, is you don't get all the shares back for the $500 million. So that reflects
effectively the amount of shares they gave us which was based at $425 million at the price on I think it was March 1.
So it was not $48.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Josh, I would just point out it's going be cheap relative to what the stock is going to be.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: I hope so. That would be my – the goal. The other thing I was wondering just in terms of the
pace, do you expect to be done with the program before hurricane season? Do you expect to be buying during hurricane
season? How does that affect your purchasing habits?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: You mean the accelerated program?
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: The accelerated program and both programs together. Where do you expect to be come July
1, I guess compared to September 30?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: So the accelerated program goes as late as July 2nd. So we don't have control over that. And
after that we will go back to open market purchases. So we generally, if you look in the past two years or three years,
we slow down during hurricane season. So probably mid-July, through the end of September, kind of pending where
the storms are, we buy less and we buy more in the first half of the year and in the fourth quarter.

Next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your question?
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks. Good morning. Just could you give some details on how the Drive Wise program is
rolling out and what you expect for the next 12 months from that program?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Hey. Good morning Adam, this is Tom. I'll make a general comment about Drive Wise and
Matt can talk about the rollout. So there is a difference between Drive – first, for those who are not aware, it's
telematics, which is dealing with the connected car. There is a difference between our program and some of the other
ones out there. And then ours is a – it's called Drive Wise because it is a continuous connection with the customers as
opposed to a moment in time or one that stops at some point once you get down with the pricing. Matt can talk about
what we're doing to leverage and build that strategy out both near-term and longer-term.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure. Adam, so let me just kind of give you a snap – an assessment of where we are right
now. So it's been rolled out in 16 states so far including six in April. And we'll continue to roll that out through the
year. We'll probably have three or four states per quarter. We've seen very favorable early results from a new
business-lift perspective. So as we roll it out, the new customers are excited about it and interested in it. To date, we
have just over 400 million miles that have been driven by customers using the device. And of those receiving a driving
discount, the average savings is actually just about 14%.
So, it is both promoting safer driving behavior and resulting in a benefit to the customers. We've seen a really
interesting dynamic on the enrollment. More than a third of all new customers enroll with Drive Wise when it's
available which is a greater take-rate than we anticipated as we do this. Now we're looking – as we continue to roll this
out, we continue to look at next-generation versions of Drive Wise and ways of making it even more affordable for us,
easier to place into the car with less required interaction on the part of either customers or agents and additional
functionality that not only continues to provide us with information about driving habits that we can use to perfect our
ratings models and to provide better pricing to certain customers, but also that provided additional, tangible benefits to
customers based upon the new connection now that would be available with our data sources and them in their cars.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Great. Do you think that's helping the new issued applications, which really bumped up in the
quarter?

<A - Matthew E. Winter>: There's no doubt that it is – it has some impact but I would say this is a system, Adam, and
it's hard to attribute upticks to any one component. There's lots of things happening all at once, including decline in
taking rate, including tremendously improved agent productivity and agent engagement. There's marketing
effectiveness with new types of ads. There's new generations of agency management systems that are helping the
agencies be more productive. So I think there's lots of things contributing to that new business lift, but we do know that
Drive Wise is providing some lift as well.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS. Your question, please?
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yeah, good morning. Matt, I've asked this in the past on some calls and I'll just ask it again
here. The favorable loss trend you continue to see on the homeowner side, how much do you think of that is your own
underwriting initiatives? And if that's the case, how much of that – how long are we going to see that benefit in loss
trend from what you've been doing with deductibles and roofs and stuff?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Yeah, did we answer your question last time, Brian?
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yeah, a couple or two quarters ago you did. I'm not going to tell you what you said, though.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: I believe I remember what I said every time, which was that – I'm not going to give you
exact percentages but about half is due to sustainable changes in our model. And in our underwriting standards and we
were benefiting from some favorable weather that contributed about the other half. Look, this is a constantly evolving
product line as more and more House and Home gets in the market and as a greater percentage of our homeowners
book is comprised of House and Home product, it will impact our sensitivity to certain weather patterns and to certain
events. And as the weather changes and as we continue to get more and more sophisticated in our risk management and
our concentration limit and the way we use our full portfolio, that's going to change it as well.
You may recall, Brian, that I mentioned that we look at the homeowners issue as a portfolio. So we not only have the
historical Allstate product, we have the new House and Home product. We have our access in surplus carrier in North
Light and we have a multitude of non-proprietary homeowners' offerings provided through Advantage, our brokerage
capability. And so as we continue to refine those and stay on top of the trends, we think we will continue to make
progress. But weather is weather and it's volatile and we saw that this last quarter. We saw water claims pop up. And it
was – we saw freeze in Arizona in the middle of January that created a 300% increase in pipe burst claims in the
month. That kind of stuff happens. And so we just – we'll stay on top of it and we continue to perfect the product and
the underwriting end of risk management as a system.
<A>: Okay. Let's take the last question.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Thanks.
Operator
And our final question today is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please?
<Q - J. Paul Newsome>: Thank you. I'll just ask actually one question. What is, in your opinion, what is the normal
seasonality for the underlying combined ratio? And has that changed as your mix changes a little bit over time?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Paul, I don't think you can actually – in terms of first quarter, relative to – are you trying to
– first quarter relative to our 88 to 90, is that what you're headed towards?

<Q - J. Paul Newsome>: Yeah, and I just want to know – in the past, companies have talked about sort of non-cat,
weather-type impacts that affect things from quarter-to-quarter? I'm just curious; you've obviously changed your
exposures quite a bit over time. If that's changed?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, it's a good question. One that is very difficult and really impossible to answer because
seasonality of course all depends on weather, when you start splitting into what season is it, maybe April spring, maybe
April is still winter, as we saw yesterday. And then, of course, it depends when the weather happens, not just on the day
but the type of day, time of day. So a hailstorm during heavy traffic costs you a lot more than a hailstorm at night
because cars are in garages. So there is – we've tried to, and continued to try to answer your question so that we can
look in granularity at the level of profitability in our various states. It's really impossible. So far we've not been able to
crack the code despite lots of computer and intellectual horsepower.
<Q - J. Paul Newsome>: Thank you.
Thomas J. Wilson
Okay. Thank you all. Overall, it was a good start to 2013. We remain focused on executing our strategy which is
unique products and services to distinct customer segments. Then we have our five priorities which we'll continue to
report back to you on. Thank you for a little extra time today. We'll talk to you next quarter.
