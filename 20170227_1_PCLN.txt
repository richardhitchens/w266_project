And now, I'd like to introduce The Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Jeffery Boyd, Glenn Fogel and Daniel
Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen.
Jeffery H. Boyd
Thank you very much, and welcome to The Priceline Group's fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined by Group CEO,
Glenn Fogel; and Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some brief opening remarks, Glenn will provide a business
update, and Dan will give the detailed financial review.
The group performed well in the fourth quarter, with both room night growth and earnings exceeding our expectations.
This is a fitting conclusion to a strong year where the benefits of favorable industry dynamics, the scale of our
accommodations business and solid execution by our teams allowed us to record impressive organic growth with
attractive margins.
At the same time, our brands made substantial investments in marketing, supply, content and product innovation, to
position the business for continued growth. As we look forward, we will continue to pursue the strategy of driving
growth and attractive margins, while investing for the future.
I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their support during my tenure as Interim CEO, and
congratulate Glenn on his appointment as Group CEO. I will now turn the call over to Glenn for the business update.
Glenn D. Fogel
Thanks, Jeff. And I and the entire company want to thank you for the leadership you provided over the last eight
months as Interim CEO. It's an exciting time to become The Priceline Group CEO, and I look forward to working with
the talented leadership teams at our brands.
I'm pleased to say that the company is performing well and is in a strong competitive position. We have substantial
momentum as we execute against a very large market opportunity. I'm happy with the progress our brands made last
year and even more thrilled about the groundwork we are laying for continued growth in the future.
I'm now going to talk a little bit about our individual brands. Booking.com executed another strong year in 2016, with
accelerating room night and gross bookings growth. Booking.com added over 289,000 properties over the last year, an
increase of 33%, driving real choice for its customers. Booking.com now has over 1,155,000 hotels, apartments, homes
and other places to stay in over 220 countries and territories across the globe. And the platform includes approximately
591,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties. That is a 49% year-over-year growth rate.
Booking.com properties represent a combined total of approximately 25 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this
total, 17.2 million are within our traditional hotel partners and 7.8 million are bookable rooms or units in homes,
apartments, villas and other places to stay. We continue to expand aggressively into the alternative accommodations
market and we believe we offer more choices on an instantly bookable, no fee basis than anyone else.
For priceline.com brand, 2016 was a year of investment. With the new leadership team in place, Priceline made
progress rebuilding its technology platform and completely overhauling the front end consumer experience on both
desktop and mobile. These fundamental changes have enabled us to increase our experiment velocity and introduce
new features more rapidly.
Also, we are excited about our expanded [ph] Best Deal (05:22) brand campaign which started in February. This
consumer value proposition is an important evolution of the priceline.com brand, and we look forward to it contributing
to future growth.

KAYAK recorded another solid year for the group, posting good top and bottom line growth. We're positive about
KAYAK's prospects, as it remains the only true multi-product, global meta-search platform today.
KAYAK furthered its global footprint this year expanding into APAC and Latin America. And we recently signed a
definitive agreement to acquire the Momondo Group, a leading European travel meta engine to enhance KAYAK's
position in the European market.
We are pleased with Agoda's performance in 2016, posting solid growth and profitability despite operating in a
challenging market where aggressive discounting is prevalent. The team executed well in mobile and made smart
investments in pricing strategies, user improvements and brand advertising campaigns in target markets. And in 2017,
the Agoda team looks forward to continuing to build a very strong global merchant supply.
Rentalcars.com executed exceptionally well in 2016 and delivered a very good year despite the turmoil and impact of
the Brexit vote. Rentalcars.com met some key metrics of 2016, which included growing its mobile mix, increasing its
share of direct business, improving the customer experience and growing the number of suppliers on the platform.
These achievements will continue to pay dividend for the business in 2017 and beyond.
OpenTable achieved several important milestones this year, which we believe positions the company for long-term
sustainable growth. The company launched its global platform in October, which enables diners to search and book any
restaurant in any of its domains. We believe this is a fundamental first step in providing a truly integrated global
platform. The OpenTable network continued to grow in 2016 with over 40,000 restaurants utilizing its online
reservation system.
As we look forward to the balance of 2017 and beyond, The Priceline Group will continue to follow the strategy that
has made us successful. Our supply chains will continue to aggressively add suppliers to our network, giving our
customers more and more choice. Our front end customer service and IT teams will continue to integrate and work hard
to expand our lead as the best place for customers to book. Our marketing teams will bring more customers to our
desktop and mobile sites and promote our mobile apps, while optimizing our return on investment in order to deliver
profitable top line growth with market-leading margins.
In summary, I would like to thank my colleagues for delivering another great year. Their hard work and passion is the
foundation upon which our business has been built.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review.
Daniel J. Finnegan
Thanks, Glenn. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the first
quarter of 2017. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior-year comparable period unless
otherwise indicated.
I highlight that as we've discussed the last couple of quarters, the non-GAAP figures for our Q4 results and Q1 forecast
includes stock-based compensation and do not reflect the reduction to income tax expense related to available NOLs.
Q4 was a solid close to a very good year for The Priceline Group, with acceleration in Q4 room night growth to 31%,
compared to 29% in Q3. The 31% room night growth rate is the highest quarterly room night growth rate we've
achieved since the first quarter of 2014.
For full-year 2016, room night growth of 29% accelerated by 380 bps compared to 2015 and represents a year in which
we believe we grew our market share in the U.S. and internationally through outstanding organic execution by our
brands.
Performance was strong across each of our key geographic regions, and this momentum is carried over into Q1, as I
will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance. Rental car day growth also accelerated to 14% in Q4, compared to
13% in Q3.

Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down slightly for Q4 versus prior year on a constant currency
basis for the consolidated group, which was slightly below our forecast. Foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted
growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for our Q4 results as compared to prior year and to our forecast.
Q4 gross bookings grew by 26%, expressed in U.S. dollars, and grew by about 28% on a constant currency basis
compared to prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due
to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings and slightly lower
accommodation ADRs.
Gross profit for the quarter for Priceline Group was $2.3 billion and grew by 21% in U.S. dollars and by about 24% on
a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit, as a percentage of gross bookings for Q4, is 58 bps
lower than prior-year Q4. The decrease is due in part to book versus day time lag, with accelerating gross bookings
growth in Q4 and an expanding booking window.
Other contributing factors for the variance are discounted closed user group rates, business mix and the level of
accommodation participation in preferred placement and commission override programs. We believe that our
commission rates are defensible over the long-term based upon the significant value we deliver to our travel partners at
a relatively low distribution cost.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $2 billion, which grew by 23% in U.S. dollars and by about 26%
on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $293 million,
which grew about 9% compared to the prior year.
Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable,
grew by 12% in Q4 compared to the prior year. GAAP operating income grew by 20%, and GAAP operating margins
decreased by 29 bps compared to Q4 last year due to performance advertising, partly offset by leverage in brand
advertising and non-ad operating expenses.
Performance advertising de-leverage was impacted by lower advertising ROIs, an increase in share of business coming
through performance advertising channels, and acceleration in gross bookings growth that will partly benefit gross
profit in subsequent quarters when travel takes place, but results in more performance advertising expense in Q4.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $869 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $795
million, and grew by 22% versus prior year. EBITDA margin performance was better than our forecast due mainly to
gross profit growth and advertising efficiency that exceeded our forecast.
GAAP net income grew by 34% and fully diluted EPS increased by 35%, including increased interest expense from our
bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count resulting from stock repurchases. Non-GAAP net income
per share was $14.21, up 32% versus the prior year, exceeding our guidance for the quarter and FactSet consensus of
$12.89.
For full-year 2016, adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 billion grew by 19% and represents a 40% EBITDA margin. I'd like to
thank our people around the world for their talent and hard work to deliver such strong performance from both the top
line and bottom line perspective.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $1.1 billion of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2016, which is an
increase of about 26%. For the full-year, we generated operating cash flow of $3.9 billion and spent $268 million on
CapEx and land-use rights, which means about 35% of our gross profit converted into free cash flow.
During the year, we purchased 763,000 shares of our common stock for $1 billion. Our board recently gave us the new
authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of our common stock, which increases our total open stock repurchase
authorization to about $4 billion.
We expect to execute this program consistent with the pattern we've established over the last few years. Returning
capital to our shareholders at pace we think make sense based upon the price at which our stock is trading, liquidity

available in the U.S. without incurring sizable incremental tax friction and potential uses for such capital.
We are hopeful that the new U.S. administration's promised tax reform will give us future access to our international
cash and cash flows, with little or no additional U.S. tax cost. And you also have access to U.S. liquidity and debt
markets at attractive rates, while remaining committed to a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating.
Our cash and investments amounted to $13.9 billion at December 31, 2016, with about $1.3 billion of that balance in
the U.S.
We recently announced the acquisition of the Momondo Group for $555 million subject to regulatory review, which we
hope will be completed later this year. We're excited to add this leading European meta-search business to our KAYAK
portfolio. We intend to use international cash for the purchase at closing, and we expect the acquisition to be modestly
accretive to our non-GAAP EPS in the first year after close. We will not comment further regarding our post-close
strategy pending regulatory approval.
Now, for Q1 guidance. Q1 is off to a solid start with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key
geographic regions despite a year-over-year room night growth comp that is about 400 bps more difficult than Q4. We
estimate that the shift of Easter into Q2 has a slightly beneficial impact on Q1 gross bookings growth, with an
offsetting negative impact to Q2 gross bookings growth. The Q1 impact is offset by prior-year Q1, including an extra
day for leap year.
For Q1 guidance, we're forecasting booked room nights to grow by 20% to 25% and total gross bookings to grow by
17% to 22% in U.S. dollars, and by 19% to 24% on a constant currency basis. Our Q1 forecast assumes that constant
currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by about 1% compared to the prior year period.
The strength in gross bookings comes with associated performance advertising expense, which pressures Q1 earnings
growth and margins because the ad expense is recognized as incurred, but a meaningful portion of these bookings won't
be recognized as revenue until travel occurs in Q2, Q3 and beyond due to the normal seasonality of our business.
The shift of Easter from Q1 last year to Q2 this year will also negatively impact our Q1 gross profit, operating profit,
EBITDA, net income and operating margins and will benefit those metrics in Q2, in both cases compared to the prior
year.
Therefore, for Q1, we expect gross profit to grow more slowly than gross bookings due principally to the dynamics of
book versus day timing I just mentioned and, to a lesser extent, the other factors that impact the gross margins for Q4.
We forecast gross profit to grow by 9.5% to 14.5% in U.S. dollars, and by 11% to 16% on a constant currency basis.
GAAP operating margins, expressed as GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, are expected to be
lower than prior year Q1 by about 540 bps due largely to the seasonal timing issues I just discussed, which creates more
de-leverage in the performance advertising line.
Our Q1 forecast assumes that the long-term trend of year-over-year pressure on performance marketing ROIs will
continue, but to a slightly lesser degree than experienced in the last couple of quarters; and that paid channel growth
will continue to be strong. We expect the pressure on performance advertising efficiency over the first half of 2017 to
be slightly favorable to what we experienced over the second half of 2016.
Our forecast assumes further deterioration in ROIs over the balance of the quarter to provide us with flexibility in a
dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs.
Non-ad OpEx and brand advertising are also forecasted to pressure Q1 margins, as we invest in our brands in advance
of peak travel season and comp against the relatively later rollout of brand advertising campaigns last year. We
continue to expect to have leverage in non-ad OpEx and brand advertising over the long-term.
Q1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $550 million and $580 million, which at the midpoint is down 7%
versus prior year. EBITDA growth and margins are impacted by the same factors I just discussed for GAAP operating
profit.

We forecast GAAP EPS between $7.50 and $7.90 per share for Q1, which at the midpoint is up by about 3% versus
prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50 million shares based upon yesterday's closing
stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we've made to-date.
We're forecasting Q1 non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $8.25 to $8.65 per share, which at the midpoint is
down by about 8% versus prior year. Our forecasted non-GAAP income tax rate is about 19% for Q1 and 18% for the
full year.
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in the
earnings release. Our Q1 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S.
dollars will be negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
I highlight that the basket of foreign currencies in which we transact weakened on a weighted average basis by about
2% versus the U.S. dollar since we reported our earnings last quarter and most analysts last updated their forecasts.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA net
earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between
now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in
general or in the travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital
Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Mahaney>: Great. Two questions, please. Dan, you talked about seeing that long-term trend of
performance marketing de-leverage. You're seeing it less than you have in the past. So any thoughts on why that is? Do
you think that there is, for some reason, less competitive intensity? What would be causing that?
And then, Glenn, if I could ask you, you talked about one of the three priorities being growing the supply base. And is
that something you think you can continue to do largely organically? Are there other options for doing that? And I'm
sorry, I'm going to layer in a third question, which is do you think there's enough brand awareness of the advantage, the
size you have in instantly bookable, non-traditional alternative accommodations? Or is that potential area of growth of
marketing spend for you in the future? Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Well, Mark, on the first part, the trend for de-leverage in performance advertising, we're
pleased to see a little bit of an improvement in that trend thus far into Q1 and forecasted for the remainder of the
quarter. It's a function, I think, of all the good things our brand teams do while continuously adding to the supply
available on our websites to give our customers more choice, continuous improvement in conversion, and then also just
discipline that the marketing teams employ in these markets to try and bring us good top line growth at very strong
ROIs and profitability.
And I think just all those things converging has been helpful for us. The comp, it was difficult for the back half, but it's
also difficult for the first half of the year. So I think it's really more a function of those things that our brand teams are
doing.
In terms of competitive intensity, just from listening to the calls from some of the other players really in the space, if
anything, they appear to be as competitive or even more competitive than they've been in the past. So I wouldn't
attribute the slight favorability in trends to competitive dynamics.

<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: And, Mark, thanks for the call there. I think those are two great questions. And the first one
about growing supply and the question, can we do it organically or not? And as I made the comment a few moments
ago about last year being able to add 289,000 properties was an increase of 33%. That was all organic. We believe that
we can continue to grow the supply gravy organically. And I'll just make the point that we look many, many times
about ways to add to it inorganically through some type of acquisition.
One of the critical things that's very important is, when you go out and you buy a company that has some supply that
perhaps you may not have, you have to think about the way their systems work and how easy is it going to be to bring
in that supply into our system. All the amount of distraction make it worse in just going out and getting those properties
on our own. So as you see in the history of our company, we haven't done a lot of going out recently and getting supply
inorganically. So I think that's the part we're going to go with.
In terms of your question about the brand advantage of the instantly bookable vacation rental product – and I will add
to the fact and I'll repeat the thing about no fee to the traveler. You may have a point there, and I may take this to the
marketing people afterwards because I believe we have the absolute best product in that space out there right now. And
we definitely believe that this is something that we can drive very hard, and it's going to provide a good growth area for
us in the future. Thanks for the question.
<Q - Mark Mahaney>: Thanks, Glenn.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: So do we have the next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thanks. Glenn, congratulations on the job. You're inheriting a pretty well-oiled machine, but
just wondering if you have any thoughts about changes to the strategic direction or the M&A appetite of the company?
And then, one for you, Dan. It looks like your bookings guidance on your room nights is very robust in Q1, but
earnings and EBITDA a little bit below Street expectations. Can you help us at all understand how much gross profit
might be pushed out into 2Q relative to last year or due to Easter or any other factors? Thank you.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Thanks for that question, and it doesn't surprise me that that question would be asked. I've been
in the company now 17 years and started out doing corporate development, M&A and headed on to strategy title
sometime later. And I worked with all the CEOs very closely on our strategy. So what I would say is, while my title has
changed and the role I'm in has changed, the company's strategy has absolutely not changed.
The strategy that we've employed over the last 17 years has been very successful for us and we're going to continue
going forward the same way; and that's using incredibly talented people who are able to come up with very innovative
ideas and implement them to make sure that we're accomplishing our mission, which is to help people experience the
world.
In terms of M&A specifically, I think we've done a very good job of that in the past. We look at a lot of, lot of, lot of
potential deals, but we're careful about it. We understand the risk and we try and be prudent. So that's the type of thing
we've done in the past, and I expect this is how we're going to do it going forward.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: And, Justin, in terms of top line versus bottom line growth for Q1 forecast, I think you
nailed it well. We're pleased with the top line strength in our forecast and the growth that the business has delivered
thus far in the quarter. And that strength in top line pressures the bottom line in the first quarter where we get the gross
bookings, we incur the advertising expense, but a significant portion of them are going to check out in Q2 and Q3 and
even beyond when travel occurs. I guess, the easiest thing I could point to for you is the differential in growth rate
between gross bookings and gross profit. Eventually, I would expect those gross bookings to turn into gross profit.

We last year gave you an estimate on what we thought the Easter impact was, and we quantified it at $40 million. We
haven't done a new estimate on that. We figured we'd let that one stand. So that gives you some sense of what the
Easter impact was in last year, a benefit to Q1. And we would expect that the strong gross bookings performance in Q1
will benefit Q2 and Q3 to a large extent as well.
<Q - Justin Post>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I just wanted to ask you about your views on
meta. I mean you obviously talked a lot about how the business is kind of increasingly shifting toward performance
spend. And we've seen that obviously over the last few years. We can see it in some other company's numbers as well.
So I guess the question is, with KAYAK, which you acquired a few years ago and then recently with Momondo, I
mean, can you make this a much bigger push within Priceline, just given how much you're spending outside currently?
Thanks.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: That's also a very good question, and I think it's fairly obvious that more and more consumers
are liking the meta experience. And our goal is to have the service that the customer wants. We don't force customers
how to enter and do their travel searches. If people want to use meta, we want to make sure we're providing the best
meta, which we think we are doing. So I think in terms of answering your question, we believe that it can become a
much bigger business, but this is going to be determined much more by what the consumer wants, not by what we
want. Is that helpful?
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: It is. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Lloyd Walmsley>: Thanks. Two, if I can. First, if you can just give us a sense for where you're seeing the most
strength in the room night growth, particularly into the first quarter where you're clearly growing nicely in the face of
tough comps. Do you feel like the macro environment is improving or are there any particular geographies you'd call
out, or product types you'd call out that's driving that supply?
And then, I guess a related follow-up, if I can. Can you just give us a sense for volume growth out of some key
marketing channels? Like, do you feel like core search continues to provide nice growth? And are you seeing a ramp in
ad channels like Facebook? Are they starting to become more meaningful? Anything you could share there would be
appreciated?
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Dan, why don't you take that?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Sure, Glenn. Hey, Lloyd. So I said in the prepared remarks that the strength in room night
growth is across all of our key geographic regions. I'd say it's across all channels. I did make the point that paid
channels are growing faster than direct at the moment. And I don't think that's a surprising trend, given the strength in
top line that we're seeing with acceleration over the last few quarters. I think anytime we see that kind of health in the
top line growth, it's largely due to new customers coming to the franchise. And, hopefully, we'll be able to repeat the
trend that we've seen in the past of winning them over to become loyal customers in the future.
So we're pleased across geographies, across channels. From a macro perspective, the reported results and forecast that
we have is strong. And I'd say that what we saw from other players in our space and the large chains from a RevPAR

perspective leads us to conclude that the macro is healthy, particularly in travel.
And then, the volume growth, the paid channels are growing faster than direct. So we're pleased with the work our
brand teams and our marketing teams are doing to continue to drive strong growth, but with very good profitability. We
do care about our margins, we do care about bottom line growth and I think that the teams are striking a good balance
between the two. Core search is still an important part. PPC and Google is our biggest advertising channel. So we're
pleased with the results we're seeing there.
<Q - Lloyd Walmsley>: All right. Thanks, guys.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the first one, to go back to your last comments
on paid growing faster than direct, I guess I'd be curious to know is that true generally across all your markets,
including the more mature European markets? And if it's true in Europe, is there any anecdotes or examples you can
give us of how you're still finding ways to grow even faster paid traffic in even your more mature markets, it'd be really
helpful?
And then, secondly, just to go back to your prepared remarks, you mentioned some commission overrides. What are
those and how should we think about that for 2017? Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: I'm not going to get too much into paid growth rates by market, Brian. That could have
some competitive sensitivity to it, how aggressive we are in one market versus another. You can assume that in the
markets we've been longer, the brand is better known and we typically get more direct traffic without going to specific
growth rates market by market.
And commission overrides are a tool that Booking.com makes available to our supply partners, whereby they can
ratchet up their commission rates that they pay us in order to improve their ranking and drive more business to the
websites. And when the travel macro is healthy and the hotels and properties are successful in filling their rooms,
without employing commission overrides, we typically see them not use those to the some extent. I think that's what's
driving the trend over the last couple of quarters.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. One, on the shared
accommodation piece of the business, I want to understand a little bit the strategic decision to sort of decommission or
de-emphasize the Villas.com brand that sort of re-incorporates all the inventory at Booking.com. Just want to
understand a little bit how you felt that position due strategically for the medium and long-term?
And then, second, on the brand advertising piece. You've talked before about pushing in a brand and what sort of return
you've gotten. Any color you could give us there about what you have pushed in on brand advertising spend? What
that's done for traffic or what that's done to re-marketing would be helpful? Thank you so much.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: I'll do the first one, then I'll let Dan take the second one. About Villa.com, and this just gives
me a good example to show how innovative and how the people at Booking.com are able to come up with new ideas,

experiment, put something out into the marketplace, see if it works, not see how well it's working. And if it's not
working, they're more than willing to pull it down and change it around. And that's really an example of Villa.com.
It was an idea to help us in that non-hotel accommodation carrier. We put it out there, we experiment, we optimize.
And some point, we said, the customer prefers to have all of its inventory in one place on Booking.com, and that's
where we should spend our time, energy, effort in optimizing that. And so, that's what they did. It's one of those things
that just shows – I just love the way the people throughout our organization do, is that they're willing to – if it doesn't
work, put it down, let's move onto something else that will work. And I'm very pleased with the way we are making
that progress with that product, and I think we're seeing some substantial growth.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: And on the brand advertising side, Eric, we think it's important to the long-term health of
our brands to support them and advertise them in various markets around the world. Typically, when you make a push,
it may be ROI negative in the beginning. We're pleased with the continuous improvement and sophistication of each of
our brands to really look at the analytical metrics as they roll out new campaigns to be able to understand the effect of
this and pull back if they feel the creative isn't working and roll out with different creatives. They're testing creative,
running it in digital channels at fairly low cost before rolling it out in major campaigns on television. So I think we're
improving there. We've done a good job in the past, and we will continue to support our brands in brand advertising in
the future.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May of Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to circle back on the comment that you made earlier
about paid channels growing faster than direct right now. Do you think that's being driven more by changes in
consumer behavior? You mentioned greater use of meta. I would include social, greater use of search on mobile et
cetera, or is that being driven more by your marketing efforts that's driving that?
And then, secondly, I think a year ago you made some efforts that have helped to grow your merchant business. Just
wondering how sustainable you think the accelerated growth that you've seen in that channel over the last few quarters
is? Thanks.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Sure, Mark. So the paid channel is growing faster. Time will tell how successful we are in
converting those new customers that we found into loyal customers that come back to us directly, but our track record
in the past has been good in that regard. We've seen good growth in repeat rates. We saw positive trends in terms of
direct to the channel for our business for a good period of time there until we saw such strong acceleration in top line
growth. And I'm not surprised to see some pressure on direct share when you've got that kind of growth. It's likely that
it's going to be new customers coming to the franchise. So we're hopeful, and we'll track that. And hopefully we'll have
some good news to report to you at some point in the future in that regard.
And then, our merchant business is driven by a couple of different factors. So Booking.com has been entirely an agency
business since it was founded, and over the past year has added the ability to process transactions on a merchant basis.
They've done that for a number of reasons, but one of the principal ones was that as they were getting into more
vacation rentals, a portion of these properties don't have the ability to charge credit cards. And so, that would create a
complexity for our guest that's checking in at one of these properties, they're going to have to come with a pile of cash
to pay. And so, we charge the customer's credit card and then we remit payment for the property. So it's really just a
facilitate business, and that's driven some faster growth in our merchant gross bookings.
Interestingly, at the same time, Agoda, which has always been principally a merchant business and has had good book
growth rates for us over the past several quarters, has been adding more and more agency capability by using inventory

that they share from Booking.com. And so, I wouldn't focus so much on is merchant growing faster or agency, but
more how is the total doing. We're indifferent as to the means by which the customer wants to book. If they want to
have us charge their credit card or they want to book agency and pay at the hotel, we're okay either way. And so, that's
what's impacting the growth from quarter to quarter with the merchant rate.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Bieber of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Paul Bieber>: Thank you for taking my question. And congratulations, Glenn, on becoming the CEO. When we
think about the growth opportunities for Priceline globally, what are the geographies where you feel there's the largest
opportunity to gain incremental market share over the coming years?
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Thanks, Paul. There certainly are some areas where we know we should be able to go in and
get some more share, where we think it's an important area to be. I want to be careful with that because I certainly don't
want to give our competitors a road map and tell them where we're going to put our emphasis. But I will talk about
some that is well-known and I'm not giving anything away, that we believe over the next decade, so China will
continue to be one of the largest opportunities for travel growth. And we've done a lot of effort over the last – I've been
going to China for 30 years now. I started going to China when I first came to Priceline to help make sure that we are
part of that market. We're going to continue to do it. We do it in a number of different ways. We have our partnership
with Ctrip, but we also have two great companies that are operating in China. We have Booking.com in there and we
have Agoda in there, and we operate for all different areas.
We were doing the outbound business, that meaning Chinese people want to travel outside. And we've a great
advantage because of the breadth of our properties. We've got a great inbound business because we have the incredible
customer base we have who want to go and visit China. And then, there's the domestic business which is not as big for
us, but we're growing nicely there. So if you're asking me to give you one area which I think everybody knows is
important for travel, China is it.
Now, you also want to look if there are some big markets that – we are the biggest player in the world, but are called
big markets that we're not number one. I'll point out the U.S. We are not number one in the U.S., but that gives us more
incentive to try harder and make more share here. And so, we'll keep working on that. Is that helpful?
<Q - Paul Bieber>: Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Christopher David Merwin>: All right. Thank you. So do you think that the growth in alternative
accommodations has the potential to change the margin structure of the business over time? In other words, are you
finding that younger cohorts of travelers looking to book alternative accommodations are coming to you via direct
mobile channels? And is that helping with advertising efficiency? Or do you think of alternatives as yet another source
of supply that should drive demand through traditional paid channels? Thanks.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: I'd say it's more the latter, Chris. So the alternative accommodations have had financial metrics
similar to the rest of our business in terms of ADR and take rate. One area that the margin can be negatively impacted
for that business is just because the properties are less efficient, in that they're smaller, they may only be single unit
properties.
The touch rate for our supply teams and for our customer service teams, also given just the unique nature of some these
properties and could be a higher level of questions for guests that are looking to stay in one of them, could create and
has created a modest level of pressure in our non-ad OpEx.

Our teams continue to work on ways to make the business as efficient as possible enabling these properties to sign
themselves up, build their own content, trying to continue to make our website more and more attuned to these
differences for this type of business so that customers can self-help themselves in terms of the questions they may have
from a customer service perspective. But in terms of advertising, which is by far and away our biggest expense, I
wouldn't foresee any significant difference for this business relative to our hotel and other accommodation business.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
<Q - Naved Khan>: Hi. Thank you very much. Can you just touch up on mobile, where are you now in terms of the
share of bookings coming from mobile versus desktop? And then, I had a question on Momondo.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: I will take the first one first. And we're not going to disclose exactly where we are in terms of
mobile versus any of the other ways people book, but we will say that we know how incredibly important mobile is to
the business. And as I pointed out earlier in another question about we know where the customers are, and we believe
that customers are going to continue to want to use mobile.
They use it throughout their lives, throughout whatever they want to and then continue to use it for travel. Now, we
believe we have a great advantage because of our scale and the number of technologies that we have in there we can
develop new ways to use mobile, new ways to optimize, experiment to make sure that it's the best process, the best
service for our customers.
This is a great advantage for us. And if you're a small player or a small supplier partner, we're providing a great, great
benefit to these small supplier partners because they can't develop these mobile applications or do these developments
as quickly as we can. So it's an advantage for us in that area. And your second question?
<Q - Naved Khan>: Actually, so just on mobile and just to touch upon the conversion rates there, are you able to sort
of drive significant improvement there because obviously you're getting more efficiency in the marketing channel? So
should we then take that to understand that mobile conversions are actually doing quite well and maybe the gap
between mobile and desktop is narrowing nicely?
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Well, I'll give my comments and I'll see Dan if he wants to add anything. But I think one has to
be very, very careful about trying to figure out in terms of is mobile better, worse for us in terms of health of the
business or not. We continue to try and do the best we can to make sure that the customer is getting what they want and
converting as fast as possible. But don't forget, many, many consumers are going back and forth, back and forth. They
look on their mobile, then they go home, they use their desktop to try and get this attribution to figure out really, what
is the right calculation, we believe it's a difficult, difficult thing. And also, Dan, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: I'd just say that the performance ad efficiency has been under pressure for the back half of
2016, and our forecast is for slight improvement going forward. So there's nothing in there that I'd call out specifically
related to mobile.
<Q - Naved Khan>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, so quickly on Momondo. Can you just sort of talk about how
much of the business is flights versus hotels, and the growth rate in the business today on a stand-alone business?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: We're currently in the standard regulatory review process. So unfortunately it's not the right
thing for us to comment at all on them right now. But we will say that after we've closed on the transaction, we'll have
some more color to give to you about that.
<Q - Naved Khan>: Great. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt of Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott Devitt>: Thanks for taking my question. There's been a long history of consolidation in the industry.
There's also been a few instances of unbundling of assets. And just wondering how you think about the advertising
funnel issue move up in terms of the assets that you have in place there, the competitive advantage that you have
existing versus the value of vertically integrated further up the advertising stack? Thank you.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Yeah. That's a great question, Scott. There has been a lot of that consolidation up and down,
and there's been unbundling. And certainly we've seen acquisitions and we've seen people build things organically. Our
goal is to provide a great service to two sides of the market. One is the person who is traveling and the other is to our
partner supplier. So on the demand side, obviously, we want to try to get that person traveling as quickly as possible, as
fast as possible and provide them with the content they need.
Now, we have started our business down at the bottom where we convert right away. And that is a great place to be
because that's where you can make good money. And we also know that by providing more content to help them make
their decisions earlier will help make them more loyal to us. So we build out that too.
So as anything, we experiment, we test, we optimize and we see are we getting the return we want for the amount of
money and people and effort that we're putting into something. And that's the way we're going to do it going forward. I
will say that I think we're pretty good at it and I'm looking forward to continuing to do it the way they've been doing it
for 17 years.
<Q - Scott Devitt>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie. Your line is open.
<Q - Tom White>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I think last quarter you guys talked a little bit about focusing
more on affiliate deals or distribution deals as a way to drive growth. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you
guys have done that many of those types of deals in the past. I guess, can you maybe just give us some color about how
your thinking there has changed and how you kind of weigh the benefits of those deals versus having to split the
economics. And just curious if this is a channel that will be big enough where it'll have some appreciable impact on
your revenue margins over the next year or two? Or is it still quite small? Thanks.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Thanks, Tom. And since you referenced remarks made in the last quarter, I'm going to pass this
to Dan.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: There's been no big change in our approach to affiliate deals, Tom. We've been focused on
them for a long time now. We have a way of looking at affiliate deals that we want to make sure that we're getting good
branding out of them and that it's a fair share of the economics with the affiliate partner.
So we typically wouldn't participate with a click farmer type of affiliate that doesn't really have a brand and they're just
using our content to potentially compete with us in paid advertising channels and take a slice of our economics. But
deals that we've done with partners like Southwest Airlines, we think those are great. That's a real brand that has
customers. And to the extent they're also looking for a place to stay, we're the perfect partner to help their customer find
that place to stay.
And in terms of the economics, I mean, we don't disclose them obviously, but there's been no significant change over
the last several years. And that wouldn't come out of revenue margin, just to be clear. Our revenue would be the full
amount earned from the hotel and then the amount that we share with the affiliate is recognized as performance
marketing.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
<Q - Mike J. Olson>: Hey. Good afternoon. I had two questions. You mentioned increased discounting Agoda is
facing. And when this happened in China, we saw Ctrip margins get hit pretty hard. How significant is the discounting
in Agoda's primary markets? And do you expect any material impact on Agoda margins as a result of it?
And, secondly, do you consider getting more aggressive with some of the strategies that priceline.com historically
emphasized and essentially go back to the future, I guess, by putting some more resources into opaque or last-minute
models like what companies such as Hotel Tonight are experiencing success with? Thanks.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about APAC in general. APAC is a competitive, competitive market.
And we have a number of people out there who are building their business in ways that they believe that offering a
lower price by using their own money to discount is advantageous for them in the long-term. So at that time, we have to
make decisions whether or not we're going to match or not and I believe I mentioned some of the very good things that
Agoda has been doing is pricing strategies and very effective.
In regards to the priceline.com company, as I mentioned, they've come out with a new brand. They really are coming
out with this consumer value proposition that is really to tell the consumer that we got the best deals now, that these
deals are being provided by the suppliers and we're not discounting them. That doesn't necessarily mean that we are
hurting our margins at all.
In fact, it's a great deal for everybody. The hotel gets their customer, and we get a similar margin that we would get
anyway. So I don't think that you should be too concerned about how much I think [ph] you're really coming out
(53:07) is it going to be a big hit to margins in the long-term. I don't think you should be too concerned about that,
which is I think where you're driving.
<Q - Mike J. Olson>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Peter C. Stabler>: Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones. Dan, in your prepared remarks you
talked about the expanding booking window. I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on whether this is
a trend you expect to continue. And then, this one's probably a lay-up, but Glenn, safe to assume no change in guidance
philosophy given your tenure and Dan's tenure? Thanks so much.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Okay. For the expanding booking window, that is a phenomenon we've observed for a
while now, Peter. And I would expect that it will continue not knowing any reason why it wouldn't. Maybe a change in
the macro healthiness of the travel market could have an impact. We've seen the last several quarters pretty healthy
ADR. So I think it's beneficial for people to book in advance. We have growing numbers of repeat users that are
familiar with our model, love the flexibility that it gives them. And so, I think as people are more familiar and they use
our service a number of times and become direct customers, they're more comfortable booking in advance. So, yeah,
right now I'd say that that should continue going forward.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: And the second question, we put guidance out there because we believe this is what we believe
is the guidance that we put out. I don't really think we're going to make any changes.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Thanks, guys. Maybe a quick follow-up on social. Anything notable to call out format

OpenTable global platform in the quarter. At a high level, what's kind of the next focus for that business specifically?
Thanks.

Facebook to improve their product so that we can get the opportunity to put more money to work there. We're always
looking for anybody who can help us bring us more customers at good ROIs, and produce loyal customers that come
back to us directly. It's still very, very, very early. And we're working hard. We work with them and we're hoping to
have success down the road with them. I can't promise it will happen or not, but we're going to work with them and try
and make it happen. What was your second question?
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Thanks, Glenn. It was on OpenTable you mentioned the global platform launched in the
quarter, rolled out in the quarter. At a high level, what's the next focus for that business specifically?
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Again, we don't like to talk too much about what we're planning doing next. But as we've said,
we retooled the strategy, which is to build the business at a more profitable level, less investment. And we are very
hopeful that we are growing out that global platform and be able to bring to our customers what they want, which is
mainly content and the ability to get reservations for restaurants throughout the world. Now, it's going to take some
time. More time, perhaps, than we thought originally. But we still believe in the product and we believe that when
people are traveling they need a place to eat.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Got it. Thanks, Glenn.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Patterson of Raymond James. Your line is open.
<Q - Justin T. Patterson>: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to circle back to vacation rentals. You've had a lot
of momentum in supply there. Could you talk about the factors driving that and how we should think about supply
growth by geography going forward? Thank you.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Well, the factors that drive the growth in supply for us is no different, whether it be a vacation
rental or a regular hotel, rental car, or whatever hotel. Look, we have people out there who are trying their best to go
out and make sure that the people who have that supply understand the benefits of our low-cost distribution system.
And when we show them the benefit of it, generally people say, yeah, I want to be part of that. Because I see the
incredible number of customers who are coming to our site from around the world, in 42 languages, who want to find a
place to stay, or rent a car, or whatever we offer. So it's no different at all.
Now, you're asking for specific areas that are, again – I want to just make this very, very plain that we believe we need
to be everywhere throughout the world. So I'm not going to say we should be more on this place or that place; we want
to be everywhere because customers are traveling around the world and they want to stay everywhere. And that's what
we're going to do.
<Q - Justin T. Patterson>: Got it. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Erickson of Pacific Crest. Your line is open.
<Q - Brad D. Erickson>: Two quick follow ups. First, are you able to unpack the growth on the room night metric
between traditional hotel versus alternative accommodation? And then, secondly, just curious [indiscernible] (58:27)
about seeing a bit of ROI leverage here on a comparable basis. Just curious how that compares to the alternative
accommodation and what's contemplated in forward outlook? Thanks.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: That's Dan.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Yes. Brad, you see the property growth on our website, and that's been driven more by
vacation rentals. So you can assume that the vacation rentals are contributing nicely to our room night growth. We don't
split out the growth rates separately, but that's been a nice tailwind to our growth rate for several years now as we
continue to have more and more vacation rentals. And it's certainly something that we expect to continue going
forward.
In terms of ROI leverage, we're not going to break that down for you by hotel versus vacation rental. I wouldn't really
think of it that way anyway. I mean, we're out there trying to bring customers to our website that are interested in a
place to stay in Rome, and maybe they're thinking they're going to look for a hotel or two hotel rooms for their family.
And then, because our teams have done such a good job of integrating the vacation rentals into the search results in a
very intuitive way, that customer may just say, you know what, this apartment in the heart of Rome is perfect for my
family. We don't need to stay in two separate hotel rooms. And the price is great and it's got a kitchen, so this is what I
want. So we're not really trying to target separately. There are some key words that maybe lend themselves more to the
vacation rental space, but we look at it from an overall portfolio perspective.
<Q - Brad D. Erickson>: Got it. Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our final question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Kevin Kopelman>: Hi. Thanks a lot. And congrats to you, Glenn. A question on KAYAK. You mentioned that
it's the only multi-product, global meta-search player. Do you see being multi-product as an advantage in meta-search?
And if so, why is that? Thanks.
<A - Glenn D. Fogel>: Yeah, I think it is. When people become loyal to a particular site, that ties meta particularly,
specifically because they are offering great services. And it's one of those things where the people who [indiscernible]
(01:01:09) providing it for our hotel, meta certainly will work for flight one, by being able to provide those great ways
to go out and see those different prices, to be able to see all that different choices, and then go easily to be able to
actually book it, that's the advantage.
Now, clearly, we believe that KAYAK is – with Momondo, you know that's mostly a flight line. You've seen that in the
press, et cetera. But we know that we're good in both areas, and we're hoping to make sure that we continue to do that.
<Q - Kevin Kopelman>: Thanks, Glenn.
