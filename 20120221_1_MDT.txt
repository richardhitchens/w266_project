MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Kristi, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Medtronic third quarter earnings release conference call. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I would now like to hand the program over to Mr. Jeff Warren, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please
go ahead.
Jeff Warren
Thank you, Kristi. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's third quarter conference call and webcast. During the
next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial
Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2012 third quarter, which ended January 27, 2012.
After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments; earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
our revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be
considered forward-looking statements, and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any
forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is
contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking
statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion
of our website at medtronic.com.
Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third
quarter of fiscal year 2011, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.

Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone joining us today.
This morning we reported third quarter revenue of $3.9 billion, which represents 2% growth as reported and 1% on a
constant currency basis. Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $888 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.84 increased 8%
and 9% respectively after adjusting for the one-time tax benefits in Q3 of last year.
From a revenue perspective, this was a challenging quarter. But looking down the P&L, we saw solid performance in
our gross margin, and our team executed to deliver the bottom line.
Our Q3 revenue reflects strength in the majority of our business. But the same time, we faced continued challenges in
our two largest businesses, ICDs and Spine. Similar to recent quarters, our results were bifurcated, with two-thirds of
our business posting strong performances, growing a combined 9%; while the remaining third declined 9%. However,
as I will explain, it does appear that both the ICD and Spine markets are beginning to show signs of stabilization, which
will result in easier comparisons and should improve our growth over the coming quarters.
Let me discuss ICDs first. From a revenue perspective, the U.S. market declined in the mid-teens year over year, a
couple of percentage points lower than Q2. However, our market data indicates that procedure volumes were relatively
stable for the third quarter in a row. And we believe that the sequential market slowdown was primarily caused by
hospital destocking.
Looking now at our own performance, our U.S. ICD revenue was down 14% year over year and was just under two
percentage points lower than Q2. But our implant volumes rose consistently in Q3, and that trend has continued into
Q4. In fact, we are currently seeing year-over-year implant volume growth for the first time in over a year. In addition,
our U.S. ICD pricing was sequentially flat in Q3, improving from mid-single-digit to low single-digit declines year
over year. As a result, we can conclude that our sequential revenue decline was primarily a result of hospital
destocking.
It is also worth mentioning that even though we faced these revenue headwinds, our U.S. ICD share is up over a point
in over past year, and we have maintained those gains sequentially despite competitors' new product launches and
without incurring typical sequential share declines we see at competitors' fiscal year-ends.
Given the fact that the market is showing signs of sequential stability, we are cautiously optimistic that year-over-year
declines in the U.S. ICD market should lessen over the coming quarters. This would significantly improve the
performance of our U.S. ICD business and with a corresponding impact on our overall corporate growth rate. To put
this in perspective, if we can improve our U.S. ICD revenue to flat year-over-year results over the coming quarters, this
alone would add nearly 1.5 points to Medtronic's overall growth.
Turning now to Spine, I was not happy with our overall performance. But let me focus on my comments on Core Metal
and Biologics separately, as each had unique dynamics affecting its performance. In Core Metal, we estimate that the
U.S. market declined in the low single digits, which is slightly worse than Q2. Our business declined 10% in the U.S.
And while we lost nearly a point of share sequentially, we did hold share versus the major Spine competitors on a
comparable basis. A large part of our share pressure continues to come from certain smaller spine companies such as
physician-owned distributors, which utilize business models and tactics that are coming under increasingly negative
public scrutiny. Looking ahead, we are somewhat optimistic given the positive trends we saw in the last month of Q3
and that have continued so far into Q4.
Now while we cannot be certain as to the drivers of these trends, and the market pressures remained with
reimbursement and price, we do know that our new products are gaining traction. Our product and procedural
innovation combined with better sales execution is becoming more visible to surgeons and generating measurable
growth in our new product lines. While our Q4 Core Metal results are likely to still be down year over year, assuming

current revenue trends continue we do expect better performance in Q4.
Let's now discuss BMP [Bone Morphogenetic Protein], where U.S. INFUSE sales continued to deteriorate. In Q2, the
year-over-year revenue decline was in the upper teens, which worsened to 30% in Q3. We saw an incremental decrease
a few weeks after negative and highly controversial data was presented at NASS [North American Spine Society] at the
beginning of November. This impact was more than we expected at the start of Q3. While the largest declines were
realized in late November and December, the declines have been in the 20% to 30% range since the beginning of
January. Until we get definitive answers from the Yale study in the first half of FY 2013, there will be considerable
uncertainty around our INFUSE financial results. As I said previously, we believe in the safety and efficacy of INFUSE
for approved indications, but we want to address any controversies by understanding the facts. That is why we
commissioned the Yale University study, a very credible third party, to systematically analyze all the available data.
In summary, while individually each part of Spine has explainable reasons for their performance, collectively the
year-over-year declines are simply not sustainable over the long term. While we continue to believe in the potential of
this market, we urgently need to see meaningful signs of improvement from our current initiatives. If we do not, we
will need to reassess our strategy and approach for this business.
Before leaving Spine, I do want to highlight the performance for our international Spine business, which should not go
unnoticed. International sales now make up nearly 30% of Spine, and they continue to grow in the mid-single digits. As
we work to stabilize our U.S. Spine business, I expect international Spine to be a consistent and solid contributor to our
company's growth.
Let me turn now to the other two-thirds of our business that is performing very well and growing at 9%. This sustained
performance continues to demonstrate that innovation can drive growth, even in the current market environment both in
the U.S. and around the world. In these businesses, our innovative products are in many cases capturing the interest of
physicians, patients, and hospital administrators. This ultimately allows us to enhance our pricing and grow our market
share.
An example of this is our Revo MRI pacemaker, a significant advancement in pacing that has contributed to over four
points of share gain in the U.S. The market is putting a premium on Revo's unique MRI technology, which has
revitalized pacing and shows us that new innovation can deliver growth, even in a market that is already substantially
penetrated.
In addition to Revo, we have other exciting technologies like the Symplicity system for renal denervation, the
CoreValve transcatheter valve, the RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator, and the Enlite CGM sensor that are
commercially available in many markets today and are driving growth. Furthermore, I am pleased that our Resolute
Integrity drug-eluting stent received FDA approval late last week. This next-generation platform offers best-in-class
deliverability and is the only drug-eluting stent approved for use in patients with diabetes.
And finally, our international regions again delivered solid mid-single-digit growth, including strong double-digit
emerging market growth. Taken together, our portfolio of exciting new products and improving comparisons in our
challenging markets should position us well to deliver improved growth over the long term.
More generally, we remain focused on the three key areas I've been emphasizing over the past eight months: improving
execution, optimizing innovation, and accelerating globalization. Crisp and consistent execution remains critical to
delivering better and more predictable business performance. Some of the efforts in improving execution are starting to
show results. For example, even with the revenue challenges this quarter, the team rapidly made the appropriate
operational changes to deliver the bottom line. We continue to optimize our innovation process with a sharpened focus
on customer economic value.
We have started to operationalize this initiative in the following ways. First, we are incorporating customer economics
in the commercial messaging for our key existing products. Second, we are assembling specific data to quantitatively
measure the economic value of selected offerings to providers and payers. Third, we are engaging strategic customers
and comprehensive Medtronic-wide partnerships to demonstrate the economic value that Medtronic can provide on a
broad scale. And finally, we're incorporating customer economic value as a key criterion in our investment selection

process. This is only the beginning, but we firmly believe that incorporating customer economic value is key to
succeeding in the new healthcare environment.
Let's now discuss globalization. Our biggest near-term opportunity in emerging markets is in our existing therapies,
which primarily address the premium segment. And these therapies have similar margins to what we routinely achieve
in developed markets. To provide some perspective, just improving penetration of these therapies in emerging markets
to levels similar to those in developed markets represents over $5 billion in annual opportunity.
Longer term, the value segment is an additional opportunity, and we are beginning to take initial steps to realize it. We
are laying the necessary groundwork to be the leaders in the emerging value segment through our previously discussed
$1 billion product cost reduction initiative combined with new business models and our investments in emerging
market infrastructure. Through this structured approach, we are putting in place plans to grow our emerging market
revenue to 20% of overall company revenue over the next few years.
In closing, I want to address our capital allocation strategy. We continue to generate significant free cash flow,
generating over $1 billion this quarter. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders,
which still allows us to make the necessary investments back into our business. I have given our business leaders clear
direction to drive more discipline into our external investments, including the need for minimal to no EPS dilution. To
the extent we don't identify targets that meet our strict value creation criteria, we will look for ways to return excess
cash to our shareholders. However, we are somewhat restricted today by the fact that the majority of our cash resides
outside the U.S. I have tasked our organization to look at ways to improve our U.S. cash flows.
Our dividend policy remains an important part of our return to shareholders. We were pleased that Standard & Poor's
added us to their S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, an elite group of companies that has consistently raised their
dividends over several decades.
Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results, and at the end of the call I will make
some brief closing comments. Gary?
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar.
Third quarter revenue of $3.918 billion increased 2% as reported and 1% on a constant currency basis after adjusting
for a $13 million favorable impact of foreign currency. While Physio-Control was part of Medtronic throughout Q3, we
are treating it as a discontinued operation, and our Medtronic revenue results do not include revenue from
Physio-Control.
Q3 revenue results by region were as follows. Central and Eastern Europe grew 28%. Growth in South Asia, Latin
America, and the Middle East and Africa was 18%. Greater China grew 12%. Growth in our Western Europe and
Canada region was 5%. Asia-Pacific grew 2%, including flat results in Japan, while the U.S. declined 3%.
Emerging markets grew a combined 16% in Q3 and represented 10% of our total sales. It is important to point out that
our results in Greater China were negatively affected this quarter by the Chinese New Year, which fell in our Q3 this
year while last year it was in our Q4. Accordingly, we would expect our Greater China growth to accelerate in Q4.
Q3 GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $935 million and $0.88, an increase of 1% and 2%
respectively. After adjusting for certain acquisition related items, Physio-Control divestiture related items, as well as
the non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense, third quarter earnings and diluted earnings per share on a
non-GAAP basis were $888 million and $0.84, a decrease of 4% and 2%, respectively. After adjusting for the one-time
tax benefits we received in Q3 of last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 9%.
In our Cardiac and Vascular group, revenue of $2.029 billion grew 1%. Results were driven by growth in Endovascular
and Peripheral, Structural Heart, AF Solutions, Renal Denervation, Pacing and Coronary, offset by declines in ICDs.
CRDM revenue of $1.192 billion declined 3%. Worldwide ICD revenue of $674 million declined 9%. And we estimate

that the worldwide ICD market declined in the low double digits.
Despite the continued market slowdown on a year-over-year basis, we believe the U.S. ICD market is showing signs of
sequential stability. In addition, the combination of our Protecta ICD, with its shock reduction and Lead Integrity Alert
technologies, along with the long-term proven performance of our Sprint Quattro defibrillation leads, which are also
now available with the convenience of a DF4 connector, continues to perform well, both in terms of share and pricing.
Pacing revenue of $467 million grew 3% in a market that declined in the low single digits. Our U.S. Pacing business
grew 8%, driven by the ongoing success of our Revo MRI SureScan pacemaker. Revo continues to command a
mid-teens percentage price uplift, which is offsetting pricing pressure in the pacing market.
Our AF Solutions business grew in excess of 40%, driven by the ongoing successful U.S. launch and the continued
adoption in Europe of our Arctic Front cryoballoon. We are taking share in the AF market, although we would expect
more moderate double-digit growth in Q4 as we anniversary the U.S. launch of Arctic Front.
Our Cardiovascular businesses had another strong quarter, with revenue of $837 million growing 8%, with 4% growth
in the U.S. and 10% growth in international markets. Coronary revenue of $382 million grew 3%, and we maintained
our number one coronary stent position in markets where we had regulatory approval for both our Resolute Integrity
drug-eluting stent and Integrity bare-metal stent. Worldwide drug-eluting stent revenue in the quarter was $195 million,
including $37 million in the U.S. We were pleased to receive FDA approval of Resolute Integrity late last week, which
we believe will be a meaningful driver of revenue growth and significant share gains.
To put the U.S. opportunity into perspective, in Europe, where Resolute Integrity is on the market and we have more
competitors than in the U.S., our DES share is over double our U.S. share. Resolute Integrity is also the only DES that
has been approved for use in patients with diabetes, which is about a third of the U.S. patient mix. In international
markets, we continue to take DES share due to Resolute Integrity's deliverability and clinical performance. In bare
metal stents, Integrity BMS allowed us to take another three points of share this quarter in the U.S.
Turning to Renal Denervation, we continued to make progress on this multibillion dollar opportunity in hypertension
and expect to generate $35 million to $40 million of revenue in FY 2012. On the commercial front, we introduced our
Symplicity system into new centers in Europe and Latin America and remain focused on expanding reimbursement into
additional countries. We also continue to make progress in our U.S. pivotal study and are tracking towards U.S.
approval in FY 2015.
Structural Heart revenue of $265 million increased 10%, driven by growth in transcatheter valves. We continue to split
the TCV market with our competitor and have clear market leadership in transfemoral, the largest TCV segment. While
the market in Europe was somewhat softer at the end of the calendar year, we continue to focus on deeper penetration
in existing centers, access to new centers, new product introductions, and new access routes, including the subclavian
and direct aortic approaches. Direct aortic had positive multi-center data at the STS [Society of Thoracic Surgeons]
conference and is becoming an attractive option for surgeons looking for an alternative to the transapical approach.
We are seeing strong interest in our new 31-millimeter CoreValve, which treats a patient population that previously
could not be treated by transcatheter valves. And we expect to expand our offering with CE Mark approval of our
23-millimeter CoreValve this spring.
In the U.S., we are pleased with the progress of our CoreValve pivotal trial. Enrollment in the Extreme Risk arm is
complete, and we continue to enroll these patients through continued access. We expect to finish enrollment in our
High Risk arm this summer.
Turning to Endovascular and Peripheral, revenue of $190 million grew 17%. In the U.S., revenue growth of 25% was
driven by the continued success of the Endurant abdominal stent graft. We have now anniversaried the launch of this
product and would expect more moderate growth in Q4. Late in Q3, we received CE Mark approval for Endurant II,
our next-generation AAA stent graft, which we expect will solidify our position as the market leader in this space.
In Peripheral, strong clinical data was presented earlier this month for our complete SE SFA, and we expect to receive
an SFA indication in the U.S. later this summer. In drug-eluting balloons, we continue to post strong double-digit

growth in Europe, and we continue to make progress on bringing this technology to the U.S.
Now turning to our Restorative Therapies group. Revenue of $1.889 billion grew 1%. Growth was driven by solid
performance in Surgical Technologies, Diabetes, and Neuromodulation, offset by continued challenges in Spine. Spine
revenue of $784 million declined 10%. In core Spine, which includes Core Metal constructs, IPDs, and BKP products,
revenue of $596 million declined 6%. Core Metal construct products declined 5%. The global core market remains
challenged and slowed sequentially, with year-over-year growth now in the low single digits. The U.S. market is also
declining in the low single digits, with mid-single-digit pricing declines offsetting low single-digit procedure and mix
growth.
We have a number of initiatives underway to improve our performance, including the upcoming launch of PowerEase,
training surgeons on our new MAST MIDLF procedure, continuing to offer a differentiated navigated spine surgery
solution, as well as the continued rollout of Solera.
While sales of Solera are growing at 10% and garnering a double-digit price uplift, we still have less than half of the
total sets in the field today. However, we continued to roll out new sets, including the 5.5/6.0 larger rod diameters to
treat complex spine and deformity, the portion of our product line most affected by competitive offerings. Over the
coming quarters, we expect Solera to become over 40% of our Core Metal revenue mix, which should help to drive
improvement in our Spine performance.
BKP revenues declined 7%. We have now posted sequentially flat results for three quarters in a row, which is relatively
encouraging given the declines we have seen in this business over the past several years. In the U.S. we are seeing a
modest uptick in BKP procedure volumes. And our new products, including the recent launch of the Expander 2
balloon, appear to be stabilizing price.
Biologics revenue of $188 million declined 20% in the quarter. BMP sales declined 26% in the quarter, including a
30% decline in the U.S. However, it is important to note that INFUSE is one of our lower margin products, muting its
impact on our bottom line. Despite the increased pressure on INFUSE, we were encouraged to see double-digit growth
in Other Biologics, including mid-teens growth in the U.S. We continued to see strong growth in our differentiated
BBM offerings, including MagniFuse, a high performance allograft formulation that was part of our Osteotech
acquisition.
Turning to Neuromodulation, revenue of $419 million increased 4%, led by double-digit growth in Uro-Gastro. In Pain,
we were pleased to receive FDA approval for the RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator with our proprietary
AdaptiveStim technology. We were unable to fully launch this product until the last week of the quarter due to a supply
disruption resulting from the flooding in Thailand. This issue is now resolved, and Q4 is off to a great start. We expect
this breakthrough technology to drive growth and take share in the U.S. market.
In DBS, we continue to see very little impact from competition in international markets, and we saw strong
double-digit new patient growth in the U.S. In Uro-Gastro, the U.S. launch of InterStim therapy for bowel control
continues to go well and is contributing to the success of InterStim.
Diabetes revenue of $367 million grew 8%, driven by double-digit growth in CGM. Our international Diabetes
business grew 16% as we continue to see great adoption of our newest products in these markets. An example of this is
our Enlite sensor, which is driving very strong CGM growth in international markets due to its improved comfort,
accuracy, and ease of use.
Surgical Technologies revenue of $319 million grew 22% including $31 million from our Advanced Energy business,
which is the combination of our acquisitions of PEAK and Salient. Our integration activities continue to go well, and
Advanced Energy is now a $120 million business growing double digits on a pro forma basis. Excluding Advanced
Energy, Surgical Technologies had strong organic growth of 10%, with solid performances across all businesses.
We delivered another good performance in capital equipment, led by our Fusion Navigation System for image-guided
surgery and the S7 surgical navigation system. In addition, we continued to see robust sales of disposables, especially
in ENT power and monitoring.

Turning to the rest of the income statement, I would like to note that my comments exclude the impact of
Physio-Control. The gross margin was 76.2%, up 40 basis points from the third quarter of last year. While the gross
margin did have a 30 basis point benefit from FX, we continued to offset pricing pressure through our $1 billion cost of
goods sold reduction program. We would expect our gross margin in Q4 to be in the range of 75.5% to 76%, which
recognizes more of a negative impact from currency as well as potential obsolescence of Endeavor as we quickly ramp
up the U.S. launch of Resolute Integrity.
Third quarter R&D spending of $364 million was 9.3% of revenue. We remain committed to investing in new
technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth, and expect R&D spending to be approximately 9% of
revenue in Q4.
Third quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.371 billion represented 35% of sales, which is a slight improvement year over
year after adjusting for one-time executive separation costs last year. We expect Q4 SG&A in the range of 32.5% to
33% of revenue, which reflects the impact of several initiatives we are focusing on to leverage our expenses while at
the same time investing in new product launches.
Amortization expense for the quarter was $84 million compared to $86 million in the third quarter last year. For Q4 we
would expect amortization expense in the range of $80 million to $85 million.
Net other expense for the quarter was $67 million, flat compared to the prior year. Net losses from our hedging
programs were $33 million during the quarter. As you know, we hedge much of our operating results to reduce
volatility in our earnings. Net other expense this quarter also includes $21 million in expense from the Puerto Rico
excise tax, which is almost entirely offset by a corresponding tax benefit I will discuss in a moment. Net other expense
this quarter was favorable to our expectations, driven by lower than expected payments of Spine royalties and the
Puerto Rico excise tax as a result of slower end market volumes. Looking ahead, based on current FX rates, we
anticipate Q4 net other expense will be in the range of $50 million to $60 million, including heavy hedging losses in the
range of $15 million to $20 million.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $33 million compared to $70 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the
$21 million non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense, non-GAAP net interest expense was $12 million.
At the end of Q3, we had approximately $9.4 billion in cash and cash investments and $10.2 billion of debt. For Q4, we
anticipate non-GAAP net interest expense will be in the range of $20 million to $25 million.
Let's now turn to our tax rate. Our third quarter effective tax rate as well as our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in
the third quarter was 19.8%. Included in this rate is an $18 million tax benefit associated with a U.S. foreign tax credit
from the Puerto Rico excise tax, which mostly offsets the charge recorded in other expense. Exclusive of one-time
adjustments, we expect our FY 2012 adjusted tax non-GAAP nominal rate in the range of 19.5% to 20%, which
includes the tax credit associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. Our Q3 GAAP results included a one-time deferred
tax benefit related to the estimated gain on the sale of Physio-Control. It is worth noting that the timing of the tax
benefit does not correspond to the timing of the sale gain which will be recorded in Q4 but will not impact our
non-GAAP earnings.
In Q3, we generated approximately $1 billion of free cash flow. We are committed to returning 50% of our free cash
flow to shareholders. Fiscal year to date, we have paid $769 million in dividends and repurchased $780 million of our
common stock. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 75 million shares.
Third quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.060 billion shares. In Q4, we have already started
our share buybacks to offset the dilution from our Physio-Control divestiture, and have bought back over $400 million
thus far.
Let me conclude by commenting on our revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance for the remainder of fiscal
year 2012. This morning, we reiterated our revenue outlook and tightened our FY 2012 earnings per share guidance.
We believe a constant currency revenue growth rate of 1% to 3% remains reasonable. While we cannot predict the
impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to
yesterday throughout Q4, then our Q4 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $20 million to $40

million.
Turning to our guidance on the bottom line, at this point in the year we are comfortable tightening our earnings per
share guidance range. We now expect FY 2012 earnings per share in the range of $3.44 to $3.47 which, after adjusting
for $0.04 to $0.06 of dilution from the Ardian acquisition and $0.10 of one-time tax benefits we received in FY 2011,
implies FY 2012 earnings per share growth of 7% to 8%. Based on our guidance, current FY 2012 earnings per share
consensus of $3.45 appears reasonable.
As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during Q4 nor
do they include the impact of the non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense.
Finally, one housekeeping item; we will be hosting our annual institutional investor and analyst meeting this year on
the morning of Friday, June 1. The meeting this year will be held in New York City.
With that, Omar and I would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. We have a number of people waiting in the
queue, so I would respectively request that you limit yourself to one question and as needed only one follow-up so that
we can get to as many questions as possible. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations
team after the call. Operator, first question, please.
Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Hey, good morning. I'll start with you, Omar. In the opening comments, you sounded less
optimistic, at least near term, on Spine versus ICDs. When you look at Spine, the issue that has really been hampering
the U.S. business is – a lot of it is the pods. If they're allowed to continue operating as they are today, is it realistic to
believe that you can turn this business with technology in the next 12 to 18 months?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: First of all, the pods are still a small segment, a small portion of the overall revenue, although
clearly they're meaningfully affecting our overall share. Now if the pod gains – continues to gain critical mass and
becomes bigger and bigger, then we've got to understand what that operating business model is and understand it more
clearly because right now it's coming under increasingly negative public scrutiny. We don't think some of those
practices are appropriate, and therefore we don't do such things. Now if it becomes really big, then that means that
there's some level of acceptance, in which case we need to reexamine our business model in that area and change our
strategy. But clearly, if it gets really big, it's something we have to pay attention to.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Okay, and then just one quick follow-up for Gary. On the ICD business in the U.S., there are
going to be a lot of questions on that. Just quickly on the OUS, can you say where the market is slowing
internationally? Is it Europe or Japan in your view?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: I think what our data would say is, it's primarily in Europe. And even there, I would say, Matt,
it's probably in Southern Europe more than anything.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Okay. Thanks, Omar. Thanks, Gary.

<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Great, just first a clarification, Gary, on the quarter. You reported $0.84. How much did
Physio contribute to that $0.84 in the quarter?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: I think the quarter was $15 million was the profits from operations that were included in that
number. So as we expected all year, the Physio acquisition, obviously, was completed – or the sale was completed here
in the beginning of our fourth quarter. Our expectation was that the results for the first three quarters, obviously, are in
our guidance and in our results. And then for Q4 here our expectation, as we've talked about, is that we will be buying
back stock to offset the impact of not having that profit in our numbers. So overall, the impact from operations that's in
the $0.84 is about $15 million. The tax gain that we're backing that out, that's a non-recurring item.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Okay, and then a follow-up question on Spine. It seems like your commentary is basically
suggesting to us that we've seen the lows in your Spine growth. Obviously, that business shrank 10% this quarter, but
you made an interesting comment that things in the last month of the quarter looked better. So can you quantify that for
us? How much better were things in that final month? What was the year-over-year growth rate in that final month
given that you called it out? And I'd just love to talk a little bit more about Spine.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Bob, this is Gary. I don't even have the absolute number in my mind as far as where the month
is. I know that trend-wise, just from seeing the data, we saw improvement as we went through January and the average
daily revenue that it was improving. Now it was still down, obviously, so it wasn't – we're not saying it was growing
during that period of time. But the decline versus the prior year was much less, and we saw that improving in Q3, and
we've seen that so far even as we went through here in Q4. And the biggest part of that was actually both on Core Metal
and also INFUSE. As Omar said in his comments, the biggest impact from INFUSE being declined, it actually was
stronger in November and December. It was somewhat less of a decline in January and we've seen a little bit of that
each here even as we start our Q4. That being said, the business is still down. It's just not down as much as obviously
we saw here in Q3.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think the comments that I made on that was primarily around the fact that if the decline
stabilizes, which is what we've been seeing, then at some point in the coming quarters, the comparisons versus prior
year will become favorable. And that's really – and we are optimistic that that will, in fact, happen. INFUSE is its own
thing here because that has different dynamics and that can lead to uncertainty at any time until we get this Yale study
result.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: And then what was Core Metal down ex-Kyphon in the quarter?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: For worldwide it was five – in mid-single digits.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Gary, I wondered if you could give us a little more granularity on gross margins. It was,
obviously, the strongest quarter we've seen in basically six quarters, and I know there's some currency give-and-takes
as well as some divestitures. But it looks like some of that strength will carry forward into the next quarter and your
gross margin guidance for the year probably comes in at the higher end of the range. So can you just help us understand
maybe as you look back over last four quarters, what's driving the GM strength, and do you think some of those trends
are sustainable?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes. First of all, I want to make sure it's clear that obviously the gross margin we're talking
about excludes Physio, which Physio – pulling that out actually improves the overall gross margin for the company by

– it will vary by quarter, but I'd say 50 basis points approximately overall, so that just ratchets everything up.
Now that being said, you're absolutely right. Even with that, the last several quarters we've been holding relatively
steady on the gross margins. And we do expect that that will continue as we go into the fourth quarter here. We have
been able to offset the pricing pressures we've seen in the marketplace with obviously introducing new products that
are seeing our pricing pressure probably less than even what's going on in the market. We mentioned that in CRDM
and even in some cases even in some of the Spine products. With these new products, we are seeing some price uplifts.
That's obviously helping us.
But the main thing I think is, obviously, the differentiator for Medtronic has been the fact that we've been – the cost
out. We've been taking $1 billion of cost out of our product costs over the last five years. We have objectives to
continue to do that going forward and have laid out the plans. And so it has been our expectation that that we can
maintain these gross margins even in this tight pricing environment, and so that is our expectation. I did highlight in my
comments that in Q4, the positive FX benefit is not quite as strong as what we've seen over the last several quarters, so
that's why we were a little bit more cautious in our guidance here for Q4.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay, and maybe just a quick follow-up. I know it's too early to think about fiscal 2013
guidance. But just basically taking Omar's comments as well as some of your comments, Gary, is it reasonable to
assume as we head into fiscal 2013 we see non-ICD Spine performance where it has been, a slight improvement in ICD
Spine performance? And do you remain reasonably comfortable this remains an upper single-digit EPS growth
business? Thank you.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Again, we're not obviously giving guidance for FY 2013 yet, David, and we will do that,
obviously, in the May discussion. But I think that the comment with respect to Spine and ICDs is even applicable based
on Omar's comments and mine even as we get into Q4 here. We do believe that these markets are starting to stabilize.
And as a result, the comparisons for us get easier as we get into some of the next quarters here, Q4 and into FY 2013.
And if our other businesses continue to do well, which they should especially with the new product launches of
Resolute Integrity, RestoreSensor, et cetera, we should see those businesses continue to perform strongly; that that
would start to have an impact on improvement in our overall revenue growth.
And from there, then, we'll clearly continue to focus on driving and delivering a bottom line that's a few percentage
points faster than the top line. That will be our expectation as we go into the future years, as we've talked about
previously. But we're not giving guidance yet as far as what that revenue or earnings per share for FY 2013 is.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Great, thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Hi.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Just first a clarification, Omar or Gary. The third quarter non-GAAP $0.84 you reported,
you announced on the last quarter call that you would call out Physio-Control as a discontinued operation. You did not
include it in revenues this quarter, but you are including the EPS benefit in that $0.84?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: That is correct, Mike. This is Gary. As we did and as you recall last quarter, we didn't know
exactly when the deal would close, and we've been, obviously, including Physio all year in our guidance as we went
forward. We did highlight the fact that once we did saw it, we thought we could offset the profit/loss by buying back
stock. But obviously, until we actually have the acquisition closed, we couldn't buy back stock to offset that. So the
assumption is the operating results from Physio, their operating earnings are in our results, but the revenue because it is
a discontinued operation does not show above the line. We did, in the press release and in our comments here, we did
try to highlight what the revenue from Physio was just so people would have an understanding of that. But that's how

we've done it. The operations are in our guidance. None of the gain aspect related to the selling of the asset will be
included in the results, but clearly the operations were.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay. Let me move forward then, two items. One, Gary, should we assume given the
commitment to return the 50% of free cash flow to shareholders and the need to rebalance your U.S. versus OUS cash
generation that the tax rate, underlying tax rate for the company, moves higher from here in FY 2013 and 2014?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Mike, we don't know for sure what's going to happen on that. We're obviously trying to do
things to not impact the tax rates. Our first things are, obviously, looking at -Omar has a lot of initiatives underway on
working capital to reduce inventory levels, to improve our focus on capital expenditures, so focusing on areas where we
can try to improve the cash mix from an operating perspective without actually addressing it from a tax side equation.
We are doing an analysis, as we indicated, in some of the recent presentations. We are doing some analysis to say what
if we did repatriate certain earnings from certain countries and what would that do to the overall tax rate because some
countries, obviously, have tax rates that are closer to the U.S. and there is a minimal impact in that regard. So we have
not made any assumptions right now. We have not made any decisions in that regard, and I don't know what the tax
rate we can expect for FY 2013 will be. But if we have to meaningfully do some things in that regard, yes, you could
see a slight uptick in the tax rate, but obviously we're going to try to minimize that to the extent we can. So we're trying
to do this without addressing that aspect of it currently, and we'll see how successful we are prior to going to the tax
rate.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay, then last question. Maybe this one is for Omar but whoever can jump in here.
Could you just talk about the pipelines at both CoreValve and Ardian? I think there's some increased concern that
competitors are really targeting those products specifically and introduce products that could potentially leapfrog either
of them in Europe in 2013. So could you just give us a better sense of what is in the pipeline for both of those product
lines?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Look, let me take a shot at it, and then Gary will also talk about it. First of all, our investment
strategy in both those product lines are pretty high. We are determined to maintain leadership. And we'll maintain
leadership by investing in technologies, by creating our own leapfrog technologies, which we've got in our own
pipeline in both of those areas, as well as driving – getting enhanced clinical data through increasing the number of
indications. So in both of those areas, those are priority investments for us. And I'm telling you that we're determined to
keep our lead. We're not going to give this thing up.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes, Mike, I can add a little bit. Again, I don't have all the details on the product technology in
either one of those, but Omar is absolutely right. We continue to invest. CoreValve, obviously, as I had in my
comments, where – there's several different things. We're obviously expanding the number of sizes that are in the
marketplace, which will broaden the market. We are, obviously, coming at it from a different approach, the direct
atheortic approach versus the transapical. We continue to look at new delivery systems, [ph] Tessa has a (46:53)
recapture built into it. So there's a lot of different things that are being done in CoreValve to enhance the product line
overall. And so we believe that we'll be very, very competitive in that marketplace, as we have been, obviously, up to
this point in time.
Ardian, the same thing; the reality is, obviously, those products are just being launched. There are several new
technologies that we're taking with, along with what we acquired from Ardian. And the business unit is trying several
different technologies that we'll probably be able to discuss a little bit more at the analyst meeting in June and to walk
you through, for both these businesses, where we're at. But Omar is absolutely right. We are continuing to invest very
heavily in these businesses and in new technology that will actually be second, third generation types of products.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Great, thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: And maybe one other point on that; we've got a breadth of technologies across Medtronic. And
we've got our CBG business as a pretty dedicated focus in making sure that technologies that are available in one
business are translated to another to give us increased competitiveness, and that's not a minor advantage. That's
something that we will leverage as we go forward.

<A - Jeff Warren>: Next question?
Operator
Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. I was just wondering if, Omar, if you just could comment on whether, with several
months under the belt now, if there's anything that you see that really changes more the strategic direction of the
company?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: A number of things; first of all, I laid out the key areas for focus for us, which I've talked about
many times: improving execution, optimizing innovation, and accelerating globalization. Right now, I'm focused on
still collecting data, but more so operationalizing these areas. And as we operationalize them, I'm finding that these are,
in fact, the right things to do. We need even more detail in each of those areas. The focus on economic value, I find
incredibly important in this environment, and partnerships with major U.S. providers and then also understanding the
[ph] bigger (49:08) ramifications of customer economic value, are things that are very important. And if anything, the
importance of this has been highlighted to me even further in the last few months.
And globalization, the thing for me that was new in the past three to four months was the realization of how much of an
opportunity there is in the [audio gap] (49:25) with our existing therapies around the world. That's just a stunning
number. And based on that, one of the areas that actually has changed is higher priority in finding ways to make sure
that these existing therapies are adequately penetrated in these emerging markets, and then taking a step back on the
value segment and approaching that with a little more time, it gives us a little more time to address the value segment,
and I think that's appropriate.
So I think minor tweaks or whatever perspective you may have on it, major or minor tweaks to the overall strategies,
which I think are the right ones. Execution is critically important. And again, our productivity in terms of R&D
spending is very high on my list. And I think using customer economic value as a center point in our investment criteria
is important, and I just talked about globalization. I think these three are the pillars that we are building our operations
around. And as we go forward, we're fine tuning them and operationalizing them to a fair amount of granular detail.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then at the annual investor conference, will you give longer-term guidance, or
will it just be for fiscal 2013?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: This is Gary. We haven't obviously decided yet what we'll do on that. But my guess at this point
in time is that it will probably just be for FY 2013, but we'll have to decide. It gets back to how comfortable we are
with where the markets are at, to be honest with you. The market volatility has been probably the biggest issue for us
over the last few years, which obviously gives us concern about giving long-term guidance, just not knowing exactly
where the markets are at. So we haven't decided yet. We'll see where we're at at the analyst meeting. Obviously, by that
point, we'll have given guidance for FY 2013. Whether we're providing longer-term guidance will depend on whether
we see our markets really stabilizing.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: And also, how quantitatively we can understand the impact of some of our initiatives, which –
that's not necessarily that simple. But we will try to give you as much data as possible and be as quantitative as we can.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.

Extreme Risk together, and what then that meant for approval for each indication.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: David, this is Gary. From what I understand is that we can file each one of them separate. And
so basically that, with the Extreme Risk arm, obviously, enrollment done; and once we have all the results, that that can
be filed separately without having the High Risk.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay, and then maybe just one follow-up for Omar and then one for you, Gary. Omar, over
the past couple quarters, it sounds like your willingness to look toward divesting businesses or reassessing the strategic
portfolio at Medtronic has become a little bit more flexible than when you first presented to us back in August. And this
time in your prepared remarks, you cited Spine. Maybe just elaborate a little bit more what specifically you're waiting
for to look at other strategic alternatives for Spine or businesses where the opportunities for innovation or incremental
growth just aren't there. And then, for Gary, how should we start thinking about the med-tech tax, which you will be
one of the first companies to present that in your guidance for fiscal 2013? And what initiatives are you undertaking to
offset the dilution from that required expense?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: First, a clarification on what I mean by reassess strategy; sure, inorganic alternatives of all
sorts exist, but I'm going to look at organic alternatives as well, reassess the way in which we're growing our Spine
business. Things will work for several quarters. A certain strategy is not delivering the results we expect, you've got to
do some things different, but organic alternatives are also absolutely in our cards.
I think I made it clear a few months ago. The way in which we're looking at our whole portfolio, and – not only at the
major business level, but within these business, is essentially look at each of the sub-businesses we have and ask three
questions. Are we in an attractive market? Do we have a team – do we feel that we have the capability to win in that
attractive market? And by win, I mean can we become a leader? And three, what is the overall value that Medtronic
adds to that specific business, and quantify that as much as possible? These are the three questions we intend to ask for
every sub-business we have in our portfolio. And we're today putting the processes in place to do this in a consistent
and as quantitative a manner as we can. And based on that analysis, which we will perform periodically, maybe two
times year, we will make decisions. And those decisions will guide the nature of our portfolio.
So I want to be as consistent and logical about this as possible, with a view towards a clear and consistent long-term
strategy as opposed to knee-jerk – what happened in the last few months or whatever, because we're here for the long
term. And we will make the right decisions that favor the long-term benefit from Medtronic and our ability to
participate in growth markets and win in those markets and also add value from our breadth. So that's the process that
we're embarking on, and we'll probably share with you a few more details, at least on the process, at the investors
meeting and more importantly, we'll put it in place as we go forward.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: David, just back to the question on the medical device tax, obviously we're still, as all
companies are, still working on understanding the exact impact of this. And you're correct; we'll be one of the first ones
that will include that in our guidance, because we'll have four months of it in our FY 2013 results. It's still only draft
regulations out there at this point in time. But our expectation, based on what we are seeing and hearing, is that the net
impact of this is probably about $125 million to $175 million for us per year. So in FY 2013, you could assume that it
could be about a $40 million to $60 million impact for one-third of that year, overall.
We're obviously looking at the businesses and ourselves are looking at a lot of different ways to figure out how much
of that, if any, can we pass on? How do we offset the cost associated with that? So we've looked at this as basically one
of the costs we're going to have to cover as we put together our plans for FY 2013 and as we put together our initiatives
on a long-term basis. This is just a cost of – it's going to be a cost of doing business here in the U.S., and we're going to
have to make the tradeoffs, and there's probably going to be things that we can't do as a result of that. But our
assumption is, this is a cost we're going to have to incur.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay, thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question; Gary, one clarification. Were those
numbers that you gave for the med-tech tax before or after tax?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Those were after tax, Larry.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Thanks. Let me focus first on the transcatheter valve market. Gary, you mentioned a
slowdown outside the U.S. in your fiscal third quarter. Could you talk about what you saw there? Was it new
competitors? Was it pricing? And did you see a pickup in January? Was this just temporary, due to budgets in Europe?
That's my first question. Thanks.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes, Larry, our sense is it's primarily more procedure related than anything, and it's primarily
just because of the capitated budgets that many of the countries in Europe obviously deal with. And so, what our sales
force would tell us and what we saw was, the data would tell us is, actually you saw a little bit of a slowdown as these
budgets were fully utilized, and so you saw a reduction in procedures. And also especially I think it was more, again, in
Southern Europe versus even the Northern European countries. So we're not saying that we – we don't think the market
is going to completely slow down, or not going to come back. But clearly because of the capitated budgets and the fact
that they were just completely used into the calendar year, we saw it slow down a little bit. It was still growing, but
obviously a little bit slower growth.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Some of the other markets, you talked about a pickup in January. Are you willing to
talk – did you see a pickup in that market in January, or did that slowdown continue?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: I don't know if the slowdown continued. I wouldn't say it bounced back as much as we saw in
some of the other businesses, which we tend to see more often, for example, this happens in a lot of our product lines,
whether it's pacing or ICDs. It's not just transcatheter valves. But I would say that we probably saw that bounce back a
little bit more in some of those other markets. That might be just due to the fact that those are more mature businesses
and the hospitals know how to handle that. We don't know, but we didn't see necessarily a bounce back in the growth
rates in January yet.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Lastly, Gary, in the U.S., there was some concern about increased seasonality in
calendar year Q4 2011. It sounds like in the U.S., you didn't see a drop-off in January due to increased seasonality. Is
that fair? Thanks.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: No, we didn't see anything really from a seasonality in January for our purpose. I think
historically, we have a couple businesses that there is a little bit of a seasonality that comes into a case because of the
higher deductibles, et cetera, that people will all of a sudden be getting into. So for example, our Diabetes business
always sees November-December being a little bit stronger and January is a little softer, historically. But the
comparisons year over year, we saw the same growth, but that's a normal phenomenon that we'll see. They see a little
bit more seasonality than probably our other businesses, because of that deductible issue.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Makes sense.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Adam Todd Feinstein>: Good morning. Maybe just – I apologize. The question has been asked a lot about this
strategy and just thinking out longer term, and I appreciate all of the details you guys have given. But with respect to
just the portfolio, a lot of the questions were about maybe thinking about selling off businesses, and you talked about
your thought process in terms of looking at the markets and looking at whether you could win.
But thinking about it slightly different, I guess, in terms of some of these businesses being high growth businesses that
Medtronic could create significant shareholder value and maybe some of these segments could trade at five to six times

revenues as standalone public entities. So you're not selling those businesses, but clearly just creating value where
maybe now you're not getting full value for some of the higher growth segments. So I guess, how are you thinking
about that in terms of just the thought process, and do you think you're getting fair value for some of the higher growth
segments?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, I think that's what I tried to address when I said, looking at the overall value of
Medtronic. So we're going through a fairly granular and quantitative approach where we're looking at each of our
businesses, high growth and not, where we're seeing – where we're assessing, what are the unique aspects of being part
of Medtronic? In other words, very clearly, are there technologies that we have in one business that we can transfer
over to another business that's unique to Medtronic and our portfolio products? So that makes a value that we are
providing that the business on its own would not have.
Are there areas where we've taken technologies and actually created new products which are linked in front of the
customer, and so the physician practitioner actually uses two of our technologies together in a way that's unique? Or do
we have plans to create such products, which, again, for a company on its own would have difficulty doing? Do we
have operational and simply cost synergies that are strong and provide extreme value from a profitability and
reinvestment perspective for that company?
So we look at a fairly granular set of criteria, and the four or five such criteria which we want to look at by
sub-business within our portfolio, and in a consistent fashion, grade that. And if at any time we find that overall,
Medtronic is not adding enough value to that sub-business and that business can be better off on its own, then that
becomes a candidate for divestiture, absolutely. By the way, the same rationale we expect to apply for acquisitions, so
the way in which we do acquisitions is also quantify and see their fit with Medtronic and what we can add. So those
questions apply to our entire inorganic strategy.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Adam, just to give you an example, with the Physio-Control divestiture we're in the process of
going through, obviously, I would say Physio-Control is probably the farthest removed of all of our businesses. And I
would tell you, as we go through this process, it's surprising how much we learn where there are more synergies than
we even ourselves understand. And so Omar's point of going back – we're finding out there were a lot of more cost
synergies than we expected, et cetera. And so it's more difficult than you envision just to go out and especially divest of
a business onto itself, if there's not someone there with the infrastructure to support it going forward. So we have to
understand all the aspects of it, but it's not just the cost component, as Omar indicated. It's also back to all the
technology and the customer relationships and what that means. But we are going through this in a very systematic
approach across every one of our products.
<Q - Adam Todd Feinstein>: Okay, thank you. I appreciate the detailed response; and just maybe a quick follow-up.
So based on that, as you think about selling to hospitals in terms of selling bundled products and just the opportunity
there, I was just curious, in terms of just how do you see hospital purchasing going in the future and certainly having
that broader portfolio, just your thoughts there?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: The broader portfolio, obviously, helps there, but that is not the only factor, like I mentioned
earlier. In fact, if we can use technology in some way, it's actually a far more differentiated approach from our
competition in many ways. However, the fact that we have a breadth of our products to a hospital is clearly an
advantage. And we think that, in the U.S., hospitals by and large will be looking at that much more expansively than
they've been before. In my discussions with different CEOs, there's consumer interest in partnerships with Medtronic,
primarily so that we can create economic value for the hospital together, through the technologies that we have. They
realize that, for the hospitals to run efficiently and profitably, they need to partner with broad technology providers and
solution providers, which we're a pretty good candidate for that.
By the way, that's true outside the U.S. as well. It has been the case in Europe for a while, where hospitals look at
companies from a much broader perspective and certainly in some of the emerging markets as well as hospitals are
being set up, the administrative management of the hospital usually looks to companies who have a breadth of
offerings. So we think that that's an advantage, but I do want to point out that's not the only advantage by any means. I
think the technology advantage and the customer focused advantage where the customer – the physician focused

advantage are in many ways even greater than the bundling opportunity. But like I said, that cannot be minimized
either.
<Q - Adam Todd Feinstein>: All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate the detailed response.
<A - Jeff Warren>: We've just gone past the top of the hour. We've got time for a couple more questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Sara Michelmore with Brean, Murray.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: Thanks for taking the question, maybe a question on the Diabetes business. It did look like
the U.S. business there had taken a step down from the last quarter, so wondering if there's anything going on there.
And then I was also looking for an update. I know you have a lot of new products internationally that have helped the
growth rate there and what the status is in terms of getting those products to the U.S. market. Thanks.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes, this is Gary. The U.S. revenue with the Diabetes business grew about 3% in the quarter,
and so it was, obviously, below what we've seen in internationally. I know that's not unusual. We've seen that over the
last several quarters. Our international growth has been more than in the U.S. But you're right; it was a little bit softer
this quarter. We saw a little bit slower pump growth at the end of the year here. And overall their CGM and everything
else was doing fine, but the pump growth was a little bit slower than what we had expected. We don't think there's any
big issue there. We just think it's more due to the slowing economy. The economy still has an impact on this business,
and we think that's part of the issue we saw here in the U.S. overall. So we're not expecting a long-term trend in that
regard. But I think you're going to continue to see the U.S. being a little softer, obviously, than the international market
where we do have all the new products.
With respect to the new products coming to the U.S., and I'm assuming you're talking about really Veo, which is the
low glucose suspend feature, and the Enlite, which is our new sensor.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: Yes.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: We're working with the FDA on that right now. We're making good progress on the IDE
[Investigational Device Exemption] for the U.S. Enlite product. And we're continuing to have conversations with the
FDA on working to get Veo into the marketplace overall. So we're excited about getting those products to the
marketplace as quickly as possible, but that's still a ways out.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: And then just to follow up on the Restore product in the U.S., is there any way to quantitate
what you think that cost you in the quarter. And I was interested in what your latest thinking was in terms of the growth
of the pain market in the U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: As we said, I think the pain market in the U.S. from our data, which we think is growing in the
mid-single digits overall, we obviously did not have the RestoreSensor really. Even though it was approved, we weren't
really able to launch of fully until, as I indicated in my comments, the very last week in the quarter. We had a supply
issue on some of the components of the products coming from Thailand, so that really hampered our ability to launch
the product fully in Q3; and if anything probably actually hurt us because we had people waiting to get that new
product. The good news is that that is resolved. We have launched those products fully now in Q4, and the business is
off to a very good start. We expect we are going to gain share back with RestoreSensor, starting here in Q4.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: Great. Thanks, Gary.
<A - Jeff Warren>: One last question.

Your final question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Joanne K. Wuensch>: Thank you very much for taking the question, two parts. One, you talked about inventory
management of ICDs by the hospitals. Are we at the end of that? And then the second piece of it is, if I heard in there
directly, you talked about minimizing dilution from M&A. Did I hear that correctly? And if so, have you changed your
strategy for M&A?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Let me take the first one, and then Omar can take the dilution question. With respect to the
destocking comment and disti inventory levels overall, Joanne, what I would say is I think this comes – this fluctuates.
As we've indicated before, about 5% of our revenue or about 20% of the CRDM revenue is in bulk purchases that we
have with hospitals. And that's going to fluctuate 10% plus or minus in any given quarter, and we saw it was lower this
quarter for ourselves. I think the competitors mentioned somewhat the same thing in some of their comments.
Is it now at the lowest, in a new low, or could that continue? I don't think any of us know for sure, but that's going to
obviously be up to hospitals and what kind of situation they're in and their inventory levels overall. So it's a normal
fluctuation that occurs in our markets. The good news for us is the implants, the daily implants, as we indicated in our
comments in Q3 and here in Q4, continue to grow and sequentially grow and are actually up over the prior year, as we
indicated in our comments. So that ultimately has to have an impact on where those inventory levels are at. So from our
perspective, that's where we focus. And then the inventory levels are going to fluctuate depending on what the hospitals
want to do.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: On the dilution question, look, to put this in perspective, Medtronic has done several major
acquisitions in the past few years which have been dilutive. These have been good deals. They are strategic for us.
They in many ways can change the way in which medicine is performed and are appropriate for us. However, it takes
time for us to realize the benefits that these deals have promised, and we are in the middle of realizing those benefits.
They're on plan but they take time.
In the meantime, our organic growth has slowed. And so to do more dilutive deals without any real discipline around it
obviously doesn't make any sense. At this stage, what we have in our portfolio, our focus is to translate the deals that
we've already done into real benefits, to realize the benefits that were promised, and we need to demonstrate that to our
shareholders and for us.
And at the same time, we're willing to look at other attractive deals which may well have dilution. But if they have
dilution, then we need to find offsets in the business to fund them. I think again there are always exceptions to this, and
so I don't want to make any hard and fast rules here. But our general direction here is that I really don't want any
significant dilution from any inorganic activity in the near term. That doesn't mean that a deal itself cannot be dilutive.
But if it is, then the business either by itself or collectively, Medtronic, has to find an appropriate offset.
<Q - Joanne K. Wuensch>: If I can follow up quickly, Physio-Control adds how much to gross margins on a
go-forward basis, the sale of that?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: What we have indicated was I think it varies by quarter, obviously, depending on where we're
at, but you're talking somewhere around 50 – 60 basis points.
<Q - Joanne K. Wuensch>: Perfect, thank you very much.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay.

Okay, thank you. Thanks for your questions. And before I end today's call, I would like to comment on Medtronic's
ability to play a leadership role in the changing healthcare environment. I've touched on some of this in the Q&A, but
let me just summarize.
In the few quarters that I've been at Medtronic, it has been clear to me that a large shift is occurring in our industry that
goes straight to the core of our industry's business model. Med-tech has tried for decades by engaging primarily with
the physician, who in most instances evaluated the merits of our products solely on their clinical value. While clinical
value and our physician customers will always remain important, there are additional decision factors and decision
makers that are playing an expanded role in the purchase of med-tech products and services. This has significant
ramifications for our industry. And Medtronic is focused on modifying our strategies to align all the activities in our
value chain to this new environment. This affects selecting the products and services that we choose to develop,
capturing additional evidence of the economic value of our portfolio, modifying how we market our products and
services, adapting the structure and skill set of our sales force, and optimizing our operational efficiency.
Change is never easy and while not all companies will be able to evolve, there will always be winners and losers in any
environment. Our breadth and our customer relationships are unique advantages that allow us to deliver value to the
overall healthcare system. And we will emerge stronger, leading our industry in providing better and more cost
effective solutions to many more people around the globe.
With that and on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and
interest in Medtronic.
