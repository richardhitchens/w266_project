MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Please standby. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners First Quarter Earnings
Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I
would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter
Thank you, Lisa. Good morning and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams
Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites,
williams.com and williamslp.com.
These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; a
presentation discussing these results; guidance updates and growth opportunities, with related audio commentary from
our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, and an update to our data books which contain detailed information regarding
various aspects of our business.

This morning, Alan will make a few comments and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. We also have the
four leaders of our operating areas present with us: Frank Billings, leads our Northeastern G&P operating area; Allison
Bridges, leads our Western operating area; Rory Miller, leads our Atlantic Gulf area, and Randy Newcomer is here
from our NGL and Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to
any questions.
In yesterday's presentation, and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking
statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it.
Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Good morning, thank you, John. Well, first of all, our cash flow metrics for the first quarter remained strong and
in line with our expectations, despite a continued decline in NGLs. Earnings at WMB however for the quarter were
impacted by higher DD&A, including an additional $17 million of non-cash amortization related to the ACMP
acquisition. But we were pleased with the 1.05 coverage at WPZ despite another 21% step down in NGL margins from
the fourth quarter of 2012 and now a 50% decline from the first quarter of 2012.
Looking forward, we see some short-term, painful, but long-term healthy cross currents, as both the NGL markets and
the natural gas markets continue to expand on the backs of low cost supplies relative to global alternatives. The natural
gas market right now is ahead as the demand decisions have already been made in response to an extended low gas
price period. But the NGL demand side will also begin to respond, but perhaps not as quickly, and certainly to more
limited options from market expansions.
As a result, we see a couple of years where NGLs will be oversupplied and producers' response to natural gas price
signals will be more – will be met by most people – would be slower than most people's expectations, just because of
the time it takes to set the flywheel rolling in these large scale operations. Areas like the Marcellus and the Utica will
be advantaged by the benefits of large scale development because those major programs are already in place.
For Williams, this results in great infrastructure investment alternatives to expand in the market access for these
large-scale NGL and natural gas values that still will be ready to deliver quickly against the positive market signals. So
in the short-term, the higher natural gas prices will negatively impact our margins, but longer term, this will drive even
more investment alternatives.
So while our 62% growth in DCF from 2013 to 2015 is certainly impressive, we could see this improve even more, if
the forecasted pricing environment holds up long enough to spur more supplies and more demand, because after all, our
strategy is built around the volume throughput that will come with expanded markets for these great low cost resources
being developed here in North America.
We're excited this quarter to announce the continuation of our 20% dividend growth at WMB through the 2015
guidance, and we look forward to sharing more about our large platform of growth capital projects that supports this
continued growth in 2015 and beyond with you with our Analyst Day coming up here on May 21. And with that, we'll
turn it over for questions.

I'm sorry, are you ready for questions?
Alan S. Armstrong
Yes, we are.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brad Olsen with Tudor Pickering.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Could you provide maybe some kind of breakdown of what is driving the CapEx growth in the
Northeast segment particularly? Is that the result of regulatory hurdles, labor, materials or another factor?
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Yeah, this is Frank Billings. The majority of the capital increase in the Northeast that we're
seeing and forecasting for really 2013 and 2014, and a little bit of 2015, is really targeted for additional capacity
requirements to support the drilling programs for our customers in Northeast Pennsylvania. We're actually expanding
market outlets to support those drilling programs and increasing our takeaway capacity to the current pipeline
connections that we have, as well as setting up for Constitution coming on as well.
The other thing we have is – the other piece of that is we do have our Three Rivers investment in that time period as
well.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great, thanks. And when you talk about increasing takeaway alternatives, is that focused more on
gathering or is there a specific long haul pipeline that you're delivering into more than you expected or where you're
building more capacity?
<A - Francis E. Billings>: It's spread out across the current delivery points that we have today. So we have our
deliveries into Transco, Tennessee, Millennium, we'll have Constitution, and those are the primary ones that we're
going to continue to focus on. And those are the outlets that our producer customers are wanting us to focus on as well.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great. And is there an update at this point on Bluegrass, how the contracting in that pipeline is
coming along? And if Bluegrass does proceed, do you believe that it reduces the demand for local market fractionation
in the Northeast?
<A - James E. Scheel>: This is Jim Scheel. Bluegrass negotiations are going very well. Right now, we have
operations, legal and commercial folks, working to finalize the agreements. It's my hope that we'll be finalizing those
sometime during this month so that we can go out to the customers with tariff proposals early next month. Going to the
next part of the question, yes, I do believe the Bluegrass will provide a great opportunity for Y grade product to move
to the Gulf Coast in order to meet the customer demand for NGLs in the large scale fractionation facilities in that area
of the country.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great, and just one last question from me. In 2014, there was a revision to the Atlantic and Gulf
segment EBITDA. It looked a little bit larger than just commodity impacts alone, and I was wondering if you could
comment on that? And that's all for me, thank you.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Alan, did you want to me to take that?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, please, Rory.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, just a couple of things going on there. Effective March 1, 2013, we have set a new
reserve rates and rates subject to refund. And the main driver there was, we wound up with a the little lower rate base to
work against than we were forecasting in earlier periods. We have a lower maintenance capital spending, and so that
drove the rate base down, which brought that kind of forward-looking base down a bit. And then there is an impact on
Gulf Star. We're probably looking at a couple of months potentially delay there. And that effect is kind of amplified
because of the accounting treatment that we're using with the Marubeni buy-in to the project. As you'll recall, we sold
half of that project to Marubeni, and due to the accounting treatment, it shows the full impact of segment profit, but the
impact on DCF is only about half of that. And Don, if you may have a little more clear accounting explanation of that,
but that's it in a nutshell.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I'll just follow up Rory's comment. Again, we consolidate the Gulfstar project, so we show
100% of it, despite the fact that our ownership is 51%, and our partner, Marubeni's interest, shows up as
non-controlling interest. So you see segment profit move down as we've pushed the startup of that project back by a
quarter. But the net effect of that is about half of what shows up in the segment profit change because of the
non-controlling interest change that offsets it.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning. It's Faisel at Citi. I appreciate the additional guidance on the dividend for 2015.
But I just wanted to ask a few questions on those assumptions in order to get to that number for dividend growth for
2015. I guess if I look at the analyst package and look at your coverage ratio for the dividend payout for 2013 and
2014, it seems like you have enough coverage, but it looks like that assumption is based on a very low cash tax rate. It's
also based on ethylene prices kind of holding up where they are, and I guess it also assumes that ethane rejection kind
of continues for the foreseeable future. I'm just wondering – what gets you comfortable that you have enough wiggle
room through the – over the next few years to increase that dividend all the way to 2015 by 20%. I mean the cash tax
rate looks a little bit aggressive and the ethylene assumption also seems – it seems decent now, but there doesn't seem
to be a lot of wiggle room?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Faisel, this is Don. I'll just take the first part of the question on the cash tax rate and then
I'll turn it over to Alan. But you're correct, cash tax rate through 2014 is fairly low, and even into 2015, it's less than
probably the long term rate. However, we have a forecast that goes out well beyond 2015 and we do account for the
fact that our cash tax rate will be moving up over time. And despite that, we're comfortable that we have the coverage,
the capacity and the underlying growth projects to sustain that dividend growth through 2015, and again, I think, we
feel comfortable that we have strong growth beyond, despite that we're not providing guidance out in that beyond 2015
period.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Faisel, I'll take the question on the pricing, particularly on the ethane and ethylene. At the
WMB level, which I assume your question is pointed to relevant to the dividend, don't forget that we do have ethane
exposure, positive ethane exposure in Canada that is not captured in a lot of that PZ analysis that we've shown in terms
of our sensitivity of ethane to ethylene, such that if you add back in that exposure, now remember that the way that
contract is structured, we have a floor that's a cost of service basis for negative ethane, but if, when ethane goes
positive, then that's long barrels that would offset that otherwise short position that we have against ethane. So at the
WMB level, we're actually fairly neutral there.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: In addition to that, we also have the impact, and it actually showed up pretty significantly
in these numbers as we went to full ethane rejection from our Overland Pass business, where we're showing full ethane

rejection throughout this period. So even though that doesn't show up as direct commodity exposure, it's pretty
significant in terms of its impact over those two-year periods. So if you really look at the full balance of our exposure
there, I would tell you we're – from a cash flow standpoint, we're pretty well neutral relative to that ethane assumption
at the WMB level. And so – and it's to the ethylene and propylene margin we're certainly showing that reducing by
about 10% from what we saw here in the first quarter of 2013. So certainly wouldn't suggest that that's not without risk,
but frankly, we're seeing a lot of pull through on the ethylene side right now, on the demand side for ethylene. So at this
point in time, we think that's a sound assumption on our part.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And Alan, just to make sure I understand the guidance going forward for 2013, 2014,
and 2015, the ethane equity sales that we saw in the first quarter and the ethane production numbers we saw in this first
quarter, are we to assume that those numbers are going to continue at the same first quarter numbers kind of going
forward, which would be a drastic sort of reduction in volumes over the fourth quarter of last year, and all of last year
for that matter. So I just wanted to make sure I understand that number in the guidance?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That is – I will tell you, even though we've said we will expect – our pricing is done on a –
in terms of what we put out is done on an annual average basis, and I would tell you it won't be that smooth, and there
will be periods where we have recovery and there'll be a short period in there as prices inch up, and then we'll see
rejection turnaround. So when we say, full rejection, we mean that in the sense that the pricing signal on an annual
average basis we'll keep that. But we'll see spotty impact. I think we had some periods of recovery here recently here in
the second quarter as well. So we'll see periods where we go in and out of recovery and rejection. But we think there's
plenty of supply to hit that bid very quickly out there in the markets and I think one of the things that's kind of reset that
market a little bit from what we would have seen maybe five or 10 years ago is there's a lot of ship or pay kind of
contracts out there, such that the variable expense to a producer is higher than what it used to have been, so they're
making a decision against the ship or pay contract, which is kind of lowering the point at which people will go into
rejection. And we, as Williams, really don't have that. And so we're right on the edge there and really looking at
variable expense, with the exception of the little bit of impact or benefit we get from the Overland Pass transportation.
So I think that's keeping that pricing level down below where you normally would see it – for to encourage ethane
recovery.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood. Thanks for the time, guys.
Operator
Our next questions from Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: My first question is just on the IDR waivers. Alan and Don, you had 1.05 coverage in the
first quarter. What made you feel like you need to do the IDR waivers through the year and how much of this was just a
reduction in price assumptions or how much of it was kind of your view that volumes are not picking up quite as fast as
previously thought?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Steve, I'll take that. I would tell you very clearly; the pricing is by far, the primary driver
for us on this. I'm actually encouraged and I think there's a good chance that we'll see volumes respond even more
positively than we have in our forecast. But I would say, we're at a little bit of a cross current here in the market where
gas prices picked up, and yet the producers were not seeing that response from the producers quite quick enough. I
think they're kind of looking at this pricing and wondering, if it's for real or not, in terms of this price pickup on natural
gas and they're not quite ready to put the capital back behind what might be a blip in price. I think if that continues that
we'll see that.
Nevertheless, I would tell you that partially because of that response, we're showing higher gas price throughout this
period, which is a big driver of that lower margin, and as we said here in the second quarter, we watched butanes drop

by $0.01 a day for almost 30 days in a row. And so I would just tell you it's hard to build a lot of optimism in that
market and that pricing looking forward and we certainly don't have a good answer. Other than exports picking up
some of that, we don't have a good answer, because we continue to see the incredible amount of NGLs that are
available in places like the Utica and the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford. And we just see those supplies continuing to
roll in. And so, yes, we've got expanding markets in the way of exports, but there's a tremendous amount of supply
continuing to build here for the next couple of years. And we're going to need to see very large scale solutions develop,
like the Bluegrass project, to really provide big enough market access for these products.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. And then, I believe you mentioned, Alan, also on the podcast just some of the lower
segment profit guidance in 2014, including some changes in service dates for projects. If you can elaborate, what is
driving a little bit of that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. I think the primary driver there for 2014 was the Gulfstar project that got mentioned
and again that just hit segment profit by the larger number and you cut that in half when you get down to DCF, that's
probably the largest impact project that we have for 2014 and I think that's really the primary driver.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. And then final one from me, the other thing you mentioned was being a little bit
disappointed with the Ohio Valley cost environment, higher costs than you had thought. Can you talk a little bit also
about what is driving that? How you see that playing out over the next six, 12 months?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. I'll take that and Frank can fill where I miss here, but I would just say, we have really
poured into that. But I think one of the things that might – some of the way that language came off, a lot of the cost
increase we're talking about, just from an accounting perspective, is much higher depreciation expense. And so that's
really one of the primary drivers of expense on that.
But I would tell you that we're working very, very hard to get our operations in line up there. And we're really trying to
not spare a whole lot of expense on that, we're certainly mindful to it. But there is so much value in getting that system
up and running and getting it up and reliable that we are – we're bringing in a lot of resources from other parts of the
country and really working hard.
That's a very high margin business for us, as you can imagine, on the one hand, and in addition to that, it's certainly a
reputational issue for us as well in terms of serving the customers out there. And so, we're working hard. There's a lot
of issues to overcome out there, as a lot of that system really wasn't built in a robust enough way to handle the
variability that we've seen in production out there. And so we're working hard to overcome that. And, so I would just
say, we're going to get there and we're having to pour the coals to it on the expense side right now to overcome some of
that.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
And we'll move on to our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks. I just wanted to come back to the 2015 dividend. What is the coverage, by the way, as
you define it, that you're looking for in 2015? I think you're at sort of 1.3 or 1.34 on 2013 and 2014, but what's your
coverage on 2015 that you're seeing?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Ted, we've not put that out yet, we'll put it out on Analyst Day, but we're comfortable we
have more than adequate coverage in light of the assumptions that are embedded in our forecast. And again, we didn't
put out all of our 2015 detail and keep you interested and coming to our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it, I will be there. Thanks. Just on Bluegrass, again, I'm trying to understand the mechanics
of kind of how the contribution that we'll get from Boardwalk. As I understand it, they will contribute the pipeline,
you'll contribute the cash, is there any kind of crossover where on capital or what not, they need to participate, maybe
walk us through that. And, then, also this idea, that ATEX at the enterprise line might run more than just ethane. How

do you see that as impacting the Bluegrass Pipeline?
<A - James E. Scheel>: I'll start with the first question. Again, this is Jim Scheel. The anticipation right now is that
Williams and Boardwalk will be 50/50 partners in the Bluegrass pipeline. Boardwalk will contribute part of Texas gas
that will have a value in the joint venture; Williams will true up through capital contributions for new construction.
We'll be equal owners throughout the pipeline as well as fractionation and storage facilities.
To the extent there is customer demand for a export facility we'd also anticipate sharing ownership in that on a 50/50
basis. That's the expectation today and that's what we're working towards currently with them in those negotiations. As
far as ATEX going into additional products, actually we would support seeing some of those opportunities to provide
clearing for near-term liquids out of the Marcellus to meeting customer demand. So I won't speak for Enterprise, but
that would be something that, I think, would help the market in the Northeast in the near-term.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a big picture one, it sounds like you have a lot of
great growth projects, a lot of capital going in. Is there any sense that you feel capital constrained at all? I'm just
wondering if there is projects anywhere that you might be turning down or maybe the pipeline into Florida that folks
are working on. Just kind of how you're thinking about, how much capital you have available relative to the opportunity
set?
<A - James E. Scheel>: Well, we certainly are in a position to allocate capital and we consistently do. And I would just
tell you, we're very – very wary of risk as we do that, and so I would say, we're allocating on a risk adjusted return
basis. And that's a good situation to be in, but we certainly are in a regular process of allocating capital and turning
down alternatives that are put in front of us today, which are above our current cost of capital, on the one hand, but on
the other hand, we've certainly loaded into our equity, pretty heavily last year. And we've got such a great set of
projects that provide so much value, that if we execute on those, that anything that can get in the way of that kind of
value being realized is something that we're going to guard against pretty heavily.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, that's it from me. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning, Sharon.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: I was just wondering, if you could talk about, I guess, the decision to undertake Bluegrass at the
WMB level. And whether you envisioned this project to, I guess generate primarily fee based cash flows that would be
appropriate as the dropdown to WPZ at some point in time?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, this is Don. I'd just say that we felt that WPZ had a pretty full plate in terms of
projects to develop and finance. And that Williams had some excess cash flow, and the Bluegrass development was
good place to put it. So clearly, it's a perfect dropdown candidate or it could even be jointly developed in time, but that
was really the thinking around the decision to, at least initially, fund that at Williams.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And then, I guess, just looking at the cash balance that you guys have and did project the
excess cash flow at WMB, do you envision, I guess any equity requirements to fund CapEx that's at the WMB level
right now?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, there's no equity requirements contemplated in this plan that we put forth, but we
wouldn't speculate as to what could occur, but again, I think as Alan mentioned, we're – we have a vast array of
opportunities. We're allocating capital very carefully looking at risk as well as strategic value and near-term value as
well, and deciding what the funds. So, it will be based on the facts and circumstances on what comes forward.

<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And then if you could just provide some color on the operational issues experienced at Ohio
Valley and how that's being resolved?
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Sure. This is Frank, again. Right now, we're really working to debottleneck the system with
some near-term projects to kind of get some – take some quick wins. But really we're beginning to implement our
long-term operating philosophy for the area that really focuses on removing the fraction of gas stream that wants to be
liquid under the conditions we're realizing in the gathering system. We're still going to move those hydrocarbons to
Fort Beeler and Oak Grove, but we're going to pull them out of the gas – gathering line and put them into our liquids
line, and then handle the separation of product upgrading at those central facilities at Beeler, Oak Grove and
Moundsville. The primary benefit that we're attempting to do is remove those liquids that are pooling in the line and
driving up the operating pressures of the system, to the point that, the liquids are curtailing the volumes.
Another significant benefit of the change in philosophy is really a significant reduction in our pigging activity which
has been impacting our reliability, but also creates a lot of operational complexity. As an example, we're going to get
operating expense improvement as well out of that, because today we've probably pigged out, pigged those systems
three times a day. And with these changes, we'll be able to do that to potentially once a month. So we'll have significant
reduction in those things that could impact our pressure, but what we find is, when we pig the system today, we don't
get very lasting benefit, given the operating conditions. And the other thing that we're really setting up for, and you've
got to remember that systems only really been out there 12 months or a little over 12 months, but we have a wide
variety of temperature and pressure that we see over a calendar year. And what we want to do is set up a system that we
feel, we can operate safely, consistently and reliably, 365 days a year. So we feel like, we've got the right half forward
and we're going to begin to implement some of those significant changes throughout the summer months.

We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with the Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: A couple of quick ones. Don, did I see correctly that you all are guiding to slightly higher cash
tax rate expectations versus the fourth quarter guidance. And what's driving that? And then Alan, I had a quick question
about the IDR forgiveness, after that?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah, Craig, I think there was a very minor change in cash tax rate, and that's usually just a
function of CapEx and taxable income, so I wouldn't read anything more into it than that. So it's just a tweak based on
all of the other changes we made in our forecast.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. And Alan, on the IDR forgiveness, I mean, frankly as a one-time event as you fill in for
commodity margin with your huge fee-based growth CapEx pipeline, a couple of $100 million as an NPV is irrelevant
on a pre-tax basis. The question, though, would be is – is this really a one-time event as you are guiding to just over one
times, 1.03, I think in 2015 PZ coverage, or could you envision a circumstance where this might have to be repeated?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well I think you could certainly describe the time where we might repeat it, if we saw,
conditions occur, but that's certainly not what our plan suggests right now, and I think, we have a fairly conservative
plan out there. I think it's really just a result of the amount of heavy investment that we're going through, right now, on
the capital side to take advantage of all of these great opportunities. And so, we are very much investing into what we
think is a great strategy, and – but that, obviously, has required a lot of equity issuance at WPZ to fund all that. And
that's certainly put a lot of pressure on that coverage, and you couple that, of course, with a rising gas price, and a
drastically, lowering NGL prices. And you know that's the circumstances we find ourselves in for 2013. None of that,
from my perspective, overshadows the great growth prospects that we've got going on in the fee-based business, and I

think our effort here is just to bridge into that more fee-based model that we're moving to. And so, I think in the future,
there will be less variables, as we become less and less reliant on the NGL margin. I think there'll be less variables that
would drive us that would require us to do that. So I think that's the way I would answer that.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Craig, I'd just – this is Don. I'd just remind you and the others on the call, that again,
Williams owns 68% of the LP units and the IDRs. If you look at our guidance, we enjoy 73% and I think, of the cash
flows out at WPZ in 2013, and I think it goes up to about 76% by 2015. So the amount of IDR reduction that's given
back to others is, call it, 25% of the total 200. So really. The lion's share of that is really staying in, and to the benefit of
Williams, it's just putting it in a different pocket.

We'll take our next question from Brett Reilly with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Brett Reilly>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Brett Reilly>: Can you just add a little bit more color on the OVM, lower volume assumptions more in the
2014-2015 timeframe, recognizing the issues you face today?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. We look at what's going on in 2013. I think if you look back at some of the producers
behind our system, they've openly said that they're scaling back 2013 drilling behind OVM. As a result, they're in
response to the current operating capacities that we have there. There's still probably 100 million a day of volume that
we're going to unlock over the next four to six months. So we feel like we can bring to bear, but we really feel that the
producers are really focused on the drilling programs for 2014 and 2015. And, given the things that we're doing up
there, I think we're going to allow the producers and Williams to get to the levels that we've previously forecasted. I
think in 2014, our volume projection is not off that far. And, I know we have a little bit of a step down in 2015, but I
really think that's less – that's probably less a response to known information. I think it's really just, when we try to just
project what we think the producers can actually do out of that area and given their volume profiles, we're really just
trying to forecast more what we see the activity being. But really, we're going to get out of – we know we're going to
have reduced volumes in 2013, for the known things we have, but we feel like we'll have the system capable of moving
the volumes that we've had in our previous forecasts. And I think we've stayed pretty close to that level in 2014.
<Q - Brett Reilly>: Okay, got it. And with the additional capital being spent in that area to resolve some of the
bottlenecks today, is there an opportunity at all to recover some of that cost or is this all incremental capital just to get
or satisfy the current contracts?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That's a good question. And actually what we're doing is, we want to make – we do have to
do some of these things to make certain that we stay in compliance with some of our current contractual obligations for
pressures at some of our field receipt points, but we have had some discussions with producers to looking at value
trades that could either be – maybe some acreage that is currently not dedicated or some other ways to get some
improvements in revenues as a result of the improved level of the service that we're going to see out there.
<Q - Brett Reilly>: Got you. And then maybe looking to the Western part of the portfolio, any update on
re-contracting some of those commitments you have out there, so that it's more fee-based versus commodity-based?
<A - Allison G. Bridges>: This is Allison Bridges. Certainly, we are proactively negotiating contracts with producers
as they are coming due. And I think that they are interested in moving away from pure keep-whole deals. So we're
looking at different ways of contracting whether it'd be fee based or based on the price of gas or other items.
<Q - Brett Reilly>: Okay. And then, last one for me, the $2 billion bump in your growth capital opportunity set at the
MB level, is that really just a function of Bluegrass or is there a few other moving pieces within there?

the expansion of the scope of the Bluegrass system to include, I think as Jim described, fractionation storage and
export.

We'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Back on the cash, on page 79, the 2014 ending cash balance of $308 million at the WMB level.
How much of that is Canadian and how much of it's domestic? And then, just along with that, with the Bluegrass
project expected to come online in 2015, I would expect a significant amount of CapEx in 2014. So how do you kind of
bridge that gap at the MB level?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Becca, the bulk of that cash is Canadian cash. How do we bridge that gap? Well, it'll
certainly be from capital raising and it could be debt, it could be equity. We'll determine that when we finalize our joint
venture agreement, and officially sanction the project.
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Becca, a couple of things on that capital. I don't think we've disclosed. I think Jim took a
question earlier around Boardwalk contributing to the pipeline and us contributing the capital, that's not an accurate
representation at all, of the funding situation there. And I think the question was that, Jim didn't say that, but that was
what the question implied. And, so there is a contribution of the pipeline, but there's – and there's some recognition of
that in value, but the sharing of the capital, obviously, is a lot more evenly split on the pipeline. As well, as I would just
say, a big chunk of that – we'd love to be in the field constructing in 2014, but I'll tell you, more likely most of the
construction dollars will actually be in 2015 and the project is scheduled to come on very late 2015.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. And then, on the Northeast. The segment data shows that I think a loss of $9
million in segment profit, and the guidance is $100 million for the year. Can you talk to us about how that ramps up, is
it, ratable to get to the $100 million, or is it more backend loaded?
<A - Francis E. Billings>: I guess I'm not – I need to see – I'm not quite certain of the information. Are you looking at
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: She's looking at the first quarter versus your annual guidance.
<Q - Becca Followill>: I'm looking at the adjusted segment guidance that's in the PZ first quarter data book that's on
page five, it shows guidance for Northeast G&P is $100 million for the year, versus, sorry, I've got so many pieces of
paper around here. I think the first quarter was a loss of $9 million.
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Okay, let me see if I can get that in front of me.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Why don't we take...
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. And then, while you guys are looking, Geismar in your call, in your podcast ,you talked
about cost overruns at Geismar. Can you quantify how big those are?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Well I don't think we have disclosed that. I would tell you, it's still a little bit of a moving
target at this point, but what we do know is that some of the estimations of the amount of steel and amount wiring and
so forth came in at a higher level. So you can see on page 61, there you can see kind of a new range for that, but I
would tell you we are pretty far along on it in terms of the project itself and have a very good idea that required

additional materials and labor on that. And, so that's reflected in there, but I don't think we've disclosed the actual
amount on that, but again, you can get a very good feel for that on page 61 in terms of the range there.
<A - Francis E. Billings>: And to your question on the first quarter versus the year guidance, this is Frank, again. I
think what you're seeing in the first quarter is, we had some slip issues and we also had the rupture on the pipeline
system in the Ohio Valley that hit some of the first Q [Q1] guidance, but if you look at our business up there, other than
the kind of the what we are experiencing LBM, our business in Northeast Pennsylvania around our Susquehanna
County supply hub assets as well as our LMM business, is performing pretty well. And we should be seeing good cash
flow and segment profit coming out of those areas. So it's not back end loaded. We should see it start to come back
quarter-to-quarter over the rest of the year.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. And then the last one is on the IDR support. You talked about up to $200 million
that is really going to fluctuate depending on how much WPZ needs. So as we model that, do you look to you guys
wanting to target throughout the quarters at 0.9 times coverage or what kind of coverage would you give support to or
what kind of – how much cash to get to what kind support level on the IDRs?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Becca, I think we've maintained some discretion over that, but we have 1.05 coverage in
the first quarter. We'll look at what the second quarter results are on a year-to-date basis as well as our outlook for the
balance of the year and we'll make a determination. I wouldn't expect that necessarily we won't try to put each quarter
exactly where we would expect the full year to be, but we'll look at kind of year-to-date actuals as well as the outlook
for the year in determining how much to waive each quarter to get to the full year effect that we're looking for.
<Q - Becca Followill>: The $200 million only applies to 2013, not to 2014, is that correct?
<A - Francis E. Billings>: It is for the next four quarters, so.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Four quarters, okay.
<A - Francis E. Billings>: It would available, as you can see right now, we're not forecasting that we would need that
in 2014, but it is available.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Our guidance includes a waiver for each, well, for the next three quarters. So if you look at
Q2 through Q4, and the actual payment for Q4 would extend into early 2014, that's what's in our guidance model.
However, the commitment is up to $200 million over the next four quarters, and we're targeting a 0.90 coverage ratio
for 2013, and again, we didn't model any direct waiver beyond the next three quarters, even though we mentioned four
quarters, potentially.

Our next question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Appreciate the time here. I think most of the questions here
have been asked, but maybe just a couple of cleanup, and first, just to clarify the projected spending on Bluegrass, that
anticipates the 50/50 structure or is that being showed more 100% at this point?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: It's in a 50%, Carl, but it's not in our guidance. It's only in the disclosure of projects that
are beyond the guidance set of projects.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay. And then, lastly, if I could just clarify and appreciate the extra information on Gulfstar,
this is with respect to 2014 WPZ guidance. Is it possible to clarify – maybe Gulfstar is the only major project of note,
but is it possible to clarify of the reduction in 2014 segment guidance, and so I understand, this is the segment, not the
DCF, how much of that came from the collective shift of in-service dates?

<A - Rory Lee Miller>: I'm not sure. I have that. This is Rory. I'm not sure, I've got that. If I had to guess, I'd say it's
around half of it, and then the other biggest driver would be, the other item that I mentioned, is about going through our
rate case, and our reserve rate and just dealing with a little lower rate base.
But the Gulfstar project is going extremely well, I was down there last week, and looking at the hull – the project looks
fantastic. It's – and a lot of these projects are very complex, and we think it could be a couple of months' delay on there.
So that's about half of that change.

Our next question comes from Selman Akyol with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Most of the questions have been asked. In terms of Geismar, do you have a turnaround schedule
for this quarter?
<A - Randy Newcomer>: This is Randy Newcomer. We're – right now, we're planning, we're finishing up the detailed
planning around the turnaround and the integration of the expansion, but that will happen – the tie-in of the expansion
will happen during the turnaround. Right now, we're anticipating, bringing the plant down for maintenance and for
tie-in of expansion, in the latter part of August. So it will be a third quarter kind of event.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: And how long would you anticipate being down at that time?
<A - Randy Newcomer>: We're planning, right now, it's looking like we'll have in our forecast about 50 days down.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: 50 days, okay. Thanks. And then, also in the quarter, in terms of production, given the strength
of margins -I think you were at 246 million pounds this quarter compared to the prior quarter of 261 million pounds, I
was – I would have thought you'd be a little higher than that given the strength in the market. Any comment there?
<A - Randy Newcomer>: Yeah, a couple of things. One is that if you'll recall the price of propane was down very
considerably in the first quarter and propane was actually the preferred feedstock during that time. And so, we ran
heavy on feed, which makes less ethylene, makes more propylene, and actually, higher profitability. So that's a part of
the reduction in the volumes in the first quarter. The other one was, we had some furnace issues that kind of kept us one
furnace short for most of the quarter, and those have since been resolved.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: All right, thanks. And then, just more of an industry question. I guess we've been hearing that
ethane rejection's been running at about 175,000 barrels per day. Does that seem like the correct number? Could it be
higher than that, from what you see?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would say – from the vantage point that we have the areas that we have, I would say that's
probably fair, of the ethane that's positioned to be recovered today. Obviously, if you included all the ethane that's
being rejected up in the Northeast, it would be considerably larger than that, but I don't think anybody's really counting

that, because it hasn't been in the market previously. But, I do think that looking if you track propane volumes and then
track those relative to ethane volume, you can get a pretty good idea, even though as people reject ethane, as I'm sure
you're aware, it does lower propane recoveries a little bit. And so, I think that's a good indicator, but I would say from
our vantage point that 175,000 is probably in the ballpark, it might be a little north of that, but that's probably a pretty
close estimation.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: All right. And then, finally just for clarification purposes, you guys talked about your forecast
being based on ethane rejection. Is that at the same level going forward for the next several years or do you have that
declining in your forecast?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, we have the same. Really, when we estimate that, for us we're basically just looking at
our plant economics and our variable cost economics and determining what we're going to do, obviously, not
determining on what the whole market will do. And as I mentioned earlier, I think there is a lot of contract structures
out there where there might be percent of liquids contracts where the producer might be – sorry, the processor might be
driven economically to continue to recover, because they don't have the shrink risk or there are take-or-pay or
ship-or-pay obligations where the variable decision, if you will, is lower, and so, they'll take a lower, because they're
going to have to pay the transportation, fractionation, anyway. Therefore, it will take a loss on the ethane. And so I
think those are driving some of those decisions, but for our decisions, we basically are forecasting that we'll be in full
rejection at all of our plants throughout the period. Now as I said earlier, I can assure you that will not be the case, that
there will be periods where we're up a little bit as margins pop-up and we'll take advantage of those, but as it's modeled
in our plan right now, it isn't full rejections.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: All right, thank you.

We'll take our last question from Helen Ryoo with Barclays.
<Q - Helen Jung Ryoo>: Good morning, actually most of my questions are answered, but just on accepting rejection,
is any of your keep-whole contract on your processing plants have must – on those contract is there any must recover
ethane volume or could you just sell them at methane price when you have that negative spread?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, well, really the way that works from a contract standpoint is we just replace any BTUs
that we take out. So if we didn't take the ethane out, we'd just leave the ethane in and we don't have anything to keep a
producer hold on. So we're not really exposed on that provided that we reject it, it's just we only have to replace any
BTUs that we take out.
<Q - Helen Jung Ryoo>: Okay, and then, so, I guess, that the full ethane rejection that you saw in the quarter, it's
mainly effecting just the Overland and Conway fractionators.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That's correct. Now the Overland Pass line, of course, collects the ethane from our
Colorado – sorry, our Piceance and our Wyoming plants, so that's Opal, Echo and the Willow Creek facility. And those
are a large producer of our equity ethane barrels, it's a very large portion or equity ethane barrels. And so those are in
rejection, but remember, that those go into Overland Pass, they're not actually fractionated at Overland Pass – sorry,
they're not actually fractionated at Conway. They're fractionated by ONEOK and at their fractionation facility in the
Midcontinent, typically. So those are – those are two unrelated issues, I would just say. Conway is seeing the impact of
rejection in the Midcontinent, most of its barrels and its NGLs come in from barrels that are produced in the
Midcontinent area.
<Q - Helen Jung Ryoo>: Got it. And do you have any take-or-pay type contracts on the Overland pipeline?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, we do not.
<Q - Helen Jung Ryoo>: Okay, great. And then, just a follow-up or it could be a clarification, but, I guess, did you
change your Marcellus gathering throughput expectation for 2015, compared to the previous quarter data book. And if

so, how much of that is driven by, I guess the spending reduction in the Laurel Mountain that was mentioned?
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Sure, give me just a second to pull up my notes.
Operator
And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan
Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Let me get the answer – finish the answer to that question. There was a few things that were
– that went on in the data book to data book. To your specific question, the largest volume reduction was probably
around Laurel Mountain Midstream. And what we did there is, we have basically forecasted, given that's a dry gas
system at this point, and really in anticipation of Chevron switching their drilling program into the wetter areas over the
next few years, pulled out volume out of that area, but we also pulled back some capital as well. So it was a decision to
reduce the capital that was associated with some of that volume growth. In ABA, what we did is we used to prior
reporting, we actually had some volumes that were coming out of the Williams zone system and then flowing into the
Laser system, even though it was the same MCF, we were showing those as being two volumes. So in the current data
book, we've made a change to pull – to pull that out and we're also doing some re-contracting on that business. So it
was being accounted for because we were getting a fee from Williams, and then we were having a fee from Laser. So
we made that change. So that was probably the two largest ones, and then, obviously, we did a little bit of a
modification in Ohio Valley which I mentioned earlier.
<Q - Helen Jung Ryoo>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Sure.
Alan S. Armstrong
Okay. This is Alan Armstrong. I'll go ahead and close out the call. Thank you very much for your continued interest in

out for these very low cost resources here in North America. And we are still very lucky to be so well-positioned in the
locations we are to be a major player in providing this infrastructure and excited to see the kind of very long-term
growth trajectory we have, not just a flash in the pan kind of growth, but very long-term growth trajectory that's going
to come off of these major investments that we're making here both last year, this year, and into 2015. So again, thank
you for joining us. And we look forward to seeing you on May 21.
