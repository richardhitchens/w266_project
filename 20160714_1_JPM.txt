MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second quarter 2016 earnings call. This call is
being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan
Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on
our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55 and a return on tangible common
equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter particularly given the backdrop. And while there
were no significant items shown here on the page, our underlying performance was even stronger if you exclude the
impact of other notable items, primarily credit, legal and tax, all of which you will hear about as I go through the
presentation.

And that strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IB fees
compared to the first quarter. As well as strong core loan growth of 16% reflecting good demand across both consumer
and wholesale, and record consumer deposit growth up $54 billion.
Before I go through the results, let me turn a moment on two topics that are top of mind. First, an update on wholesale
credit. You will see that the total wholesale credit costs this quarter were approximately $200 million. Within this,
charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by oil and gas and metals and mining. And those charge-offs were
very substantially offset by reserve releases, so they were previously reserved, which means the underlying, the net $50
million reserve build, we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million, principally one energy
name downgraded in the CIB.
Although the oil and gas sector remains stressed and reserves will continue to be idiosyncratic, overall trends have been
somewhat positive, with oil prices continuing to stabilize and firming sentiment in the sector, improving access to
capital markets. In addition, outside of energy, we still have not seen contagion or deterioration in our wholesale or
consumer credit portfolios.
Second, on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk off environment. And following the decision,
the markets were quite volatile as expected, and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermarket. The
market functioned quite well, absorbing the volatility. And despite the significant increases in volumes, our systems
were stable and we continue to support client activity with decent trading performance.
With respect to next steps, as you know, the ultimate relationship between the UK and the European Union, broadly,
and access to the single market and passporting will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period depending on
when Article 50 is invoked. We continue to work on plans for the full range of outcomes, but we will be appropriately
patient. The most important point is that we remain committed to fully supporting our European and UK clients across
businesses, and we will be fully able to do this. And while executing against certain of these options would be complex,
ultimately, we will protect the franchise and minimize any friction cost, so that they will be manageable for the
company.
Moving on to page two, revenue of $25.2 billion was up $700 million year on year on higher net interest income. For
the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at the Investor Day despite headwinds from a
flatter yield curve. Given that our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front-end of the curve and as industry
deposit re-price to-date has remained low coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth.
Non-interest revenue was flat year on year, with the increase in markets revenue being offset by declines in IB fees as
well as asset management. Adjusted expense of $14.1 billion was down $140 million, reflecting continued progress
against our commitments. We still expect full-year expense of $56 billion plus or minus, as the second half of the year
includes our expectation of an increase in the FDIC surcharge in the third and fourth quarters.
Moving on to capital on page three, the firm's advanced fully phased-in CET-1 ratio was 11.9%, with standardized at
12.1%, both up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital
generation, with RWA remaining relatively flat. Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6%, as capital
generation was offset by balance sheet growth.
This quarter, we returned $4.4 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.6 billion of net repurchases and
common dividends of $0.48 a share.
Finally, we're pleased we did not receive an objection to our capital plan, and the board authorized gross repurchases of
up to $10.6 billion.
Moving on to page four and Consumer & Community Banking, Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.7
billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers. We had record deposit
growth again this quarter, up 10% year on year. Average loans were up 11% with core loans up 23%, driven by
mortgage and auto but with continued strength across all products. And we had record business banking loan
originations of $2.2 billion, up 14% year on year, and with a strong pipeline, up 17%.

We added nearly 2 million households year on year, with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter, reflecting strong
acquisition trends, including the launch of Freedom Unlimited. And finally, our active mobile customer base remains
the largest among U.S. banks, up 18%.
Revenue of $11.5 billion included some non-core items, which contributed a little under $200 million, principally a
one-time gain on Visa Europe and negative mark-to-market on Square. Adjusted for this, revenue was up 2%.
Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth. Mortgage revenue
was up 5%, with rates remaining low, supporting production margins and on growth in NII as we added $14 billion of
high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue.
Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was up but flat if you exclude the non-core items I mentioned, with growth
in Card and Auto offsetting the impact of card renegotiations. Expense was down 3%, driven by lower legal expense
and continued progress against our efficiency commitments, allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and auto
lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day.
Finally, credit trends across the Consumer businesses continue to be favorable, with charge-offs in Card trending up
slightly. Over the last two to three years, we have responsibly expanded our credit box in Card in the prime and
near-prime space. As these vintages season, we would naturally expect a higher loss rate and performance is in line
with our expectations. These loans are coming on at ROEs higher than the portfolio average. So as the mix of our
portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly.
And as such, we built $250 million of reserves this quarter.
Moving to Auto Credit, competitive pressures have caused some lenders to take more layered risk. We have maintained
our underwriting discipline, with average FICO scores and LTVs better than the industry and with a very sharp focus
on avoiding risk layering. Our credit performance is in line with expectations and we built $50 million in reserves this
quarter, largely reflecting volume growth. Against these reserve builds, we saw releases of $125 million, principally
driven by Mortgage.
Turning to page five and the Corporate & Investment Bank, CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.2
billion and an ROE of 15%. In Banking, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven
by lower equity underwriting fees. We maintained share and ranked number one in global IB fees, ranking number one
in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were flat versus a wallet that declined 15%. This quarter, we ranked
number two globally and grew share by 50 basis points.
In equity underwriting, global issuance improved after a weak first quarter but was down from a strong quarter last
year, with fees down 37% in a market down 42%. We continued to rank number one globally, growing share by 30
basis points, and we ranked number one in every product category for the first half of this year. Debt underwriting fees
were down 2% from a strong prior year, largely in line with the market which was down 4%, and we ranked number
two globally.
Moving on to the outlook for fees, given the decline in M&A volumes, lower wallet is expected in the second half of
2016. We expect to see positive momentum in ECM as the new issuance market continues to improve, and we expect
DCM to be broadly in line with the first half, reflecting robust high-grade bond issuance, offset by lower acquisition
finance. Lending revenue of $277 million was down 8%, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans.
Markets revenue of $5.6 billion was up 23% year on year. As I mentioned at the beginning, the Brexit vote triggered a
spike in volatility and volumes across asset classes. We were able to meet our clients' needs, execute their transactions,
and provide liquidity.
Fixed income revenue of $4 billion was up 35% versus a weak second quarter last year. The positive momentum that
we saw in March continued into the second quarter, with strong performance in rates and currencies in emerging
markets on higher client flows. And performance also improved in credit and securitized products, as client risk
appetite recovered in a more stable environment, driving increased primary and secondary market activity.

Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year. With respect to the third
quarter, client activity is returning to more normal levels, and trading performance so far has been fine. Credit costs of
$235 million were driven by a reserve build for oil and gas. And finally, expense of $5.1 billion was down 1% year on
year, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 30%.
Moving on to page six and Commercial Banking. Overall, a solid quarter for Commercial Banking with net income of
nearly $700 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 16%. IB revenue rebounded from the first quarter. It was
up 23% sequentially and flat year on year. And we continue to see strong momentum in loan growth, with average loan
balances up 13% year on year.
Commercial real estate loans grew 18%, reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real
estate banking. And C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both corporate client banking and
middle market.
Revenue was up 4% year on year, driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth. An expense of $731 million was up
4%, reflecting continued investments in bankers and technology. Finally, credit performance continues to be in line
with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points driven by oil & gas, but almost fully reserved and outside
of energy credit performance continues to be strong.
Moving on to page seven and asset management. Asset management reported net income of $521 million with a 29%
pre-tax margin and an ROE of 22%. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year on year, as we continue to feel the
impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity.
Expense of $2.1 billion was down 13% year on year, largely driven by lower legal expense and recall that the prior year
included a non-core loss.
AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.3 trillion were both up 1% sequentially and down 5% and 3% year on year
respectively. We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion, as we continue to see strong net inflows into our
fixed-income products with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to de-risk, resulting in outflows in
equity and multi-assets.
Our long-term investment performance remains good with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second
quartiles over five years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $112 billion, up 4% year on year, driven by Mortgage
up 20%.
Turning to page eight and Corporate, Corporate reported a net loss of $166 million, which included two notable items.
There was a net legal benefit reflecting some favorable developments in the quarter, offset by a number of tax items
including additions to tax reserves with developments relating to open audit periods. As a result of the tax items, our
managed tax rate for the quarter was 39%. Adjusted, it would have been closer to 36%.
Now, turning to page nine and moving on to the outlook, to reiterate, our firm-wide guidance for the full year on each
of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent.
So to wrap up, a strong quarter reflecting our leadership positions and the benefits of our diversified franchise with the
consumer businesses firing on all cylinders and with robust loan growth across all businesses, we had a good result in
markets continuing to demonstrate our ability to support clients no matter the environment.
And just before I open up to Q&A, just for those of you on the phones, Jamie is here. He has a very hoarse voice, so he
will try and use it sparingly. But if you hear him croaky, that's why. Operator, open up the line, please.

<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: I know it's very early and it's probably limited in what you can say because you mentioned it
depends on the timeline of Brexit and how passporting works. But is there any kind of qualitative thoughts you can
give us around the operational and/or legal issues we should be watching as this develops, legal entity restructuring, net
impacts of moving people versus lower-cost geographies, some things like that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you, Brian. I know that everybody is keenly interested to hear what we have to say. But
the truth of the matter is it's very, very early days. The new government is just forming, as we speak. Negotiations need
to be given some time to unfold and take shape. And so it's really too early to hypothesize. We would hope that we can
continue to operate the way we are right now, but we will just continue to evaluate the landscape as I'm sure you will
over the coming weeks, months and quarters and plan accordingly. The most important thing is that we intend to
continue to support our European franchise clients throughout.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: I appreciate that. And maybe switching gears. You mentioned the consumer business was
firing on all cylinders. Clearly, there's some nervousness in the market that the credit cycle is turning, so I wondered if
you could touch on two things, which are maybe a little bit more detail on the seasoning impact you saw – you
mentioned in card.
Is it just seasoning, or is there any like-for-like deterioration? And then, in auto, you mentioned risk layering. What
particular factors are you seeing layered in the underwriting box that make you concerned right now?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So on the card space, we – as you know, we have loans running off. We're replacing them all
of the time over the course of the last couple of years since the end of 2013. We made some changes to our credit box
and our credit risk policies very, very thoughtfully. We've been monitoring it very closely. And what we are seeing in
terms of the loss rates and the seasoning of them is fully in line with our expectations. And these loans are coming on at
higher risk-adjusted margins, so the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. So nothing that would speak to anything
other than our full expectations for our credit risk appetite.
And with respect to auto, not to speak for others, but obviously when you look at lower FICO scores and higher LTVs
in longer terms on top of each other in an environment where you've already seen used car prices soften some and
they're likely to continue to do so it's something to watch. And so we've been very, very thoughtful about that, not just
today, but as we've been going through the cycle and not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms
of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry, but we've been very, very careful in – and low percentage of
subprime origination – very, very careful about looking at those layered risks.
So nothing in our – and remember, for auto this year, I think the charge-off rate is going to be sort of 40-ish basis points
compared to a long run average of more like 60, so we're sort of reverting to a more normal level if nothing else, and
used car prices will ultimately come down and we're being thoughtful about that.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Jim.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Maybe just talk a little bit about the net interest margin and the outlook there. It was down five
basis points. It looked like it was mostly in the funding costs. I just wanted to get a sense of what was driving it. I think
long-term debt was up trading liability costs were up. Can you just kind of give us a sense of what's going on there, and
how to think about that going forward?

<A - Marianne Lake>: So at the risk of not getting overly complicated, the long-term debt expense – so our NII was
flat, with loan growth and NII on loan growth being offset by long-term debt expense, which was largely to do with the
hedging of non-dollar debt and just relative quarter-over-quarter small moves in currency levels and currency basis. So
I would honestly characterize it not to sort of underpay as quarter-over-quarter noise.
Looking forward – and so when you look at our NIM, you have NII flat, you have the balance sheet growing as we
expected both on loans and trading assets, so NIM just naturally is down a few basis points. But we would be looking
for NII to be up slightly in the third and fourth quarter and for our NIM to be relatively stable.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just one follow-up on the prior question on credit, how should
we think about the provisioning going forward in consumer? Is that going to be a consistent build or is that sort of a
catch-up that we saw this quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would say there are going to be two things. First of all, obviously, when you talk about
Consumer, it kind of gets dwarfed by Card, so let's start with Card. We are growing the portfolio. We added 4% core
loans year over year in Card. And so naturally, as the portfolio grows over time, you would expect to add to reserve. So
there will be some of that but I would characterize it as modest.
And then, as these vintages continue to season we've been experiencing very, very low loss rates that start at 2.5%.
They would trend up slightly and so there will be a little bit of rates impact too but, again, as I say with very accretive
ROE. So I would look forward and expect that to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a
combination of those factors but for all the right reasons. And similarly, volume-wise, in Auto, we should see some
adds. But again, in comparison to Card, modest.

Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Hi, good morning. So my first question is, given how well JPMorgan did on the CCAR
relative to last year's results and it seems like RWA and SLR exposure have stabilized over the past few quarters, how
comfortable are you perhaps allocating more balance sheet to the investment bank, given that you seem to be very well
positioned to continue to gain market share, especially in Markets?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So as you know, Erika, everything that we do, we do with a view to, first of all, the client
franchise and making sure we are supporting our clients. And then, secondarily, with a view to all of our binding
constraints, so we will provide capital and access to the CIB but also taking into consideration our overall objective is
making sure that we stay in the 3.5% GSIB bucket. So we will continue to try to find capacity to be able to recycle it
and grow high-ROE, high-ROA business.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Great. And was there anything to call out on the equities, the $1.6 billion equities number
that could be a little more one-time in nature for the quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Not anything significant, no. I think you've got to compare it to the prior year, which was
stronger, particularly this time last year in Asia. And that's less true today, stronger in Europe, less strong in Asia. It's
more of a regional story than any particularly significant items.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay, two questions. One, on the outlook page, I see on the printed page it's the same
as what you had last quarter for the company overall, obviously. But I heard the emphasis on NII was on the plus side,
$2 billion year on year plus. Is that the right nuance that you were trying to communicate?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So let me – two pieces to the story. So yes, the guidance is $2 billion-plus year on year. You
recall when we came into Investor Day we said we would expect $2 billion rate flat, and it looks like rates will be flat
at least in the front end at this point at least for the majority of the year, if not the whole year. But you've seen already
in the first two quarters that, year over year we're up $1.4 billion so we were doing better than that on a combination of
lower deposit basis, reprices, and also strong loan growth. But if you annualize that, that would be too high. We are
going to have some impact in NII of the lower 10-year. It's not significant, but it will offset that to a degree. So we
would expect our NII to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion up year on year, largely strong loan growth, low reprice.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And then on the loan growth side, you've been funding this in part from just a mix
shift, where your loan-to-deposit ratio has moved up very nicely. It's still very low at 66%, but up two percentage
points Q-on-Q and up from 61% year on year, and I'm just wondering – how far do you think you can take that before
you might want to look to fund loan growth with deposit growth more ratably?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay, so I would say we've been doing a combination. We've been growing our deposits more
strongly than the industry, so we continue to be net-net attracting more deposits than the industry and also, as you say, a
mix shift out of securities and into loans. Our outlook for loan growth for the range of the year is to be at the higher end
of our range. We said 10% to 15% core loan growth. And at this point, demand still seems robust, so we would expect
it to be at the higher end of that range, and we certainly have been this quarter.
So at this point, I would say that it's a combination of factors. And remember that the way we think about our
investment security portfolio also takes into consideration how we think about positioning the firm's duration of equity,
so all of those factors will contribute.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good morning, just one more rate question. As you mentioned, you're super-sensitive on the
front end of the curve, and you just alluded to the curve as flatter. I'm curious about that great chart that you rolled out
on Investor Day that talks about we make $3 billion more through 2018 if rates stay flat and $6 billion more if the
curve goes down the implied path. The implied path is now lower. I'm just curious how much those numbers change if
the current curve holds.
<A - Marianne Lake>: If I get this wrong, I apologize, but I think it was actually we make $3.5 billion on the rates
implied and $6 billion on normalized rates. But in any case, let me just talk about rates flat versus implied right now.
And just because things can change so quickly, let's just focus on 2017. Rates flat from here, so with the 10-year at
about 1.5% and IOER at 50 basis points. Because of the loan growth, notwithstanding any sort of long-end pressure, we
would still expect year over year our NII next year to be up between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. Implied, which is
actually not that much different from that so it does have about 20 basis points better long-end rates by the end of 2017,
but otherwise relatively flat through the end of 2017 – would be about $0.5 billion more than that.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: That is perfect. Thank you. Other question was, there are some regulators chirping a little bit
about concerns in commercial real estate. Some of the other banks have mentioned it. You're growing like a weed and
your credit is great. So can we just talk a little bit about what you think you're doing differently to both get that growth
and then what you're doing to avoid mistakes of the past? And that would be good.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Growing like a sunflower, not like a weed.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Fair.

<A - Marianne Lake>: So look, I'll say a couple of things. The first is a lot of that growth is commercial term lending.
And it is the case that we have the technology and a process that has speed and certainty of execution and competitive
funding costs. So it is the case that – it's the value proposition that we're able to bring to clients, I think, that
differentiates us. We're able to close in times that are a fraction of what the industry is.
And secondarily, we're really concentrated on gentrified supply-constrained markets, low-rent stabilized. So these are
not the same properties that had problems in the past. We have – since the previous cycle, we have looked carefully at
our underwriting and there are some things in some regions and some products that we either don't do or don't do
significantly less of. So we're very, very careful. But we're looking at some really good credit quality in our commercial
real estate portfolio right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Hi, Marianne. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on the cost
side of things, where the overhead ratios both in the CIB and the Consumer Bank dropped fairly materially quarter over
quarter. I guess I'm just looking for some guidance here in terms of how much of the expense initiatives that you've
already been talking about both in the CIB and the CCB, how much progress did you make in this quarter on that? And
was that an outsized contributor to the improvement in the overhead ratios?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would say in the CIB it's also a revenue story, so you need to consider both factors.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Sure.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So let me talk about where we are on the expense commitments. And you'll recall that whether
you remember a $4.8 billion number or a $5.5 billion number in total, we're about 70% of the way through delivering
against that across the CIB and the CCB at the end of the second quarter. And we continue to make progress.
In the CCB, obviously, it is generally more progressive. And in the CIB, it's a bit more about technology and operations
and it takes some time to deliver that. But fundamentally, we continue to chug through that and we will get there over
the course of the next several quarters. So I would say in line with our expectations and it is a contributing factor.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. And then just in the CIB specifically, you mention the comp ratio there was 30%
that is sort of at the low end of the range that you typically talk about, which is 30% to 35%. I'm presuming that's
largely driven by the better-than-expected revenues. Was there anything else going on there or was that pretty much a
result of a benign revenue, a relatively benign revenue environment?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would say, the comp-to-revenue ratio is an outcome, just for what it's worth. Obviously,
we try to give the range to give people an idea, but we pay competitively and we pay for risk-adjusted performance, but
there's nothing notable going on. We've been actually at the lower end of our range for a little while now.

<A - Marianne Lake>: So it's always a little tricky. The share thing is going to become clearer with the rearview
mirror than it is necessarily at a moment in time. It does feel like we are doing fairly well competitively, not just against
European banks but just generally, and not just in Europe but generally, because we, as you say, have continued to be
there for clients across products across the globe.
So I would say that we feel like we are doing fairly well. We'll know whether that is share gains when we are able to
actually look at that in the rearview mirror. But there's still plenty of competition out there, and so we're just focused on
serving our clients the right way, but it does feel a little bit like we're doing well.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And I know you were asked already about Brexit. Maybe if we can hear from you, Jamie, about the
implications of Brexit. Marianne, you said, "minimized friction cost." If you can just give us some sense of what that
means. You've given us a lot of guidance about the recent quarter and the year ahead, but you have what could be a
monumental event and you haven't really talked to investors about that since Brexit has occurred. So how do you think
about currency risk, the cost, the revenues, and are you delaying any investments given the increased uncertainty?
<A - James Dimon>: So I'm going to try to tell you as best I can if you can hear me. So number one, we do think it
will reduce the GDP the UK and the EU a little bit. Obviously, that's not going to affect our business plans though it
will affect the economies a little bit. Number two, we know it is going to create uncertainty for an extended time
period. So we don't think we can answer or make certain all these things you want to know, because there are a lot of
parties involved. We are hoping that the political leaders are very sensible. It makes sense for both the EU and for
Britain to think through the process to make it sensible whatever changes they make to give businesses time, I'm
talking about years, time to adjust to the new reality which we don't know what it is.
I think the most important thing is that we will continue in every single country to serve our clients day in and day out,
but as to the quest, so be it. I'm not really worried about it. It would be nice if it doesn't create a huge turmoil. So I'm
hoping the EU is sensible, but we're going to be prepared, as Marianne mentioned. There are a range of outcomes, and
anyone in our shoes will try to be prepared for each one of them. But we're not going to pull back on serving people in
Italy, Germany, France, UK, or Spain because it might lead to higher costs. I would accept the higher costs as opposed
to disrupt our clients.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And I'd also point out, Mike, that competitively, we're not in a situation alone, and so we're
going to take our time to work out what the right course of action is. And obviously we'll update you as and when that
becomes clearer, but we're not going to be at a competitive disadvantage; if anything, as we talked about earlier, we
feel like we're in a position of strength.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. First, I've had a follow-up, so – on
Brexit. Post this development, have you seen any impact on your banking pipelines? Has this had any impact on
appetite for M&A, particularly if there is a component that involves either the continent or the UK?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The truth of the matter is it's a bit early to say for that, too, and I hate to continue to repeat that.
But I will tell you that, generally speaking, uncertainty is not particularly conducive or constructive for M&A but, in
this case, I think there are some offsets. So I would start with, in terms of the actual strategic dialogue with CEOs and
at the boardrooms, it is as good as it's ever been. And if you think about just the other factors that would be supportive
of M&A, so like cheap financing globally, low organic growth, good multiples, solid economy in the U.S. and globally,
notwithstanding, a bit of a steam taken out in Europe or the UK, all of that should continue to be supportive of strategic
M&A.
Yeah. And so at the end of the day – and currency could be supportive of cross-border activity. So there are puts and
takes. I'm certain that there will be some people who think carefully through the right timing and what to do but at the
end of the day, the strategic proposition should ultimately win out in most cases.

And similarly, volatility, generally speaking, is not particularly conducive in terms of ECM but investor appetite is still
there and there have been deals priced post Brexit. So it's a little early. There's still activity. Volatility is reasonably
subdued at this point and I think because there are no event calendars out there right now, there's still quite a lot of
opportunity in the space. Obviously, DCM, low rates would be a tailwind notwithstanding the M&A and ECM
landscape.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Great, thank you for that, and then one more on credit here. So it seems as though
we had 30-day delinquency rate actually go down quarter over quarter. So it seems like maybe – in the Card, sorry,
business. So it seems like maybe it's a cure rate issue. Is that the right assumption? And then could you give maybe a
little color on how much the non-prime growth has driven in recent vintages versus prior?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I'm going to start with the second part of the question. So we are still very much
concentrated in the prime and near-prime space but we have a higher percentage of our origination in the near-prime
space reasonably meaningfully higher over the course the last couple of years. So where we may have previously been I
think 40% above 760. Now it's less than that and more like 20% or 30% below 700. But at the end of the day, it's still
pristine credit relatively speaking.
With respect to the delinquencies, is it a cure rate issue? Not specifically, no.

Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, Marianne. I'm not sure if this is too early but when you think about expenses
longer-term beyond this year, if you think about 2017, if we find ourselves in a similar revenue environment next year,
when you wrap in your cost-save objectives and where you want to be on investment spend, do you think you'll be
shooting for expenses to be kind of in the same range of that $56 billion next year if things don't change on the revenue
front?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So look, we're not really doing much in the way of 2017 guidance right now. It will ultimately
honestly depend on the opportunities we see in front of us to continue to invest and to add customers and I think we are
at a very good run rate of investments. We've increased reasonably significantly in terms of marketing dollars and also
lease growth, and that will drive profitability in the medium to longer-term. So it's possible; if we see the opportunity to
continue to do that, we would do it, but we have no specific guidance yet.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: The revenue environment can change reasonably quickly particularly as you know with rates
to a lesser degree market. So we're not going to sort of overreact to a short-term phenomenon.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Sure. Just one near-term. You talked at a recent conference about the tax rate going
forward. Just with the kind of issues you had this quarter with the tax rate looking at 39% you said it would be 36%,
what should we think about going forward? Is it like in that 36%?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Taxes might slightly go – generally speaking, the reserve changes are somewhat episodic.
Outside of those, yes, 36% is a good central case for our managed tax rate.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Marianne, I had a question on outlook. You reaffirmed the income guidance of $50 billion,
plus or minus, for the full year. And I'm trying to gauge, just given the tough start to the year in trading in 1Q, the
subdued second-half M&A commentary and second-half trading seasonality that we would typically expect, the $50
billion target does appear somewhat ambitious and I didn't know if you felt like that was a fair assessment or just given
what you're seeing across the businesses that the $50 billion is still readily achievable?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So starting with the qualification that, obviously, as you suggested, it's going to be
market-dependent, but also remembering that we knew when we gave the guidance that we would expect the second
half to be seasonally lower. So here's what I would say. First half, markets challenged; second half, market's better,
net-net first half of market – so first quarter, market's challenged; second quarter better; net-net first half relatively flat
year over year. So call it a wash, with the acknowledgment that we knew we would expect seasonal declines in the
second half of the year.
Mortgage better; so you may recall that we said we would expect mortgage revenues to be down year on year actually
by a reasonably significant amount. Given obviously where the rate environment is as well as some positive MSR
results in the first half of the year, we would expect mortgage revenues to be more like flat. And against that, to your
point, lower IB fees and lower asset management revenues given the environment. So the way I would characterize it is
there are puts and takes, but net-net it's still a reasonable central case, so we are not changing it. But it's
market-dependent.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thanks, Marianne, and just one more for me on CCAR. Just given that you've had some
time to digest the latest set of results, the improvement in PNR was probably the most impressive aspect of the release,
at least based on our own findings. But from what you could gather based on your own internal assessment, what were
the primary drivers of the increase where maybe we have some limited visibility? So just areas like op risk. And does a
favorable CCAR outcome inform your view in terms of which constraint is currently most binding and maybe how you
might change your deployment attack across the different businesses?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay. So if I would say if you look at the last three years of PPNR, notwithstanding that there
have been obviously differences in the scenarios, 2015 CCAR results, so not this year's but last year's, were low. Not to
say that that means that these results are more normal, but I would say, if you look at the three years and look at the
PPNR results now, it's more consistent with the sort of portfolio risks revenue generation we would expect, and you can
see that because it's much more consistent with our results.
So I don't have insights that I can share with you specifically to try and reconcile the Fed's results year on year. Not that
we really try to do that. You're right, operational risk is likely a piece of it, and that was disclosed in that information.
So I would just say there can be volatility, but I feel like this is not an unreasonable place to think that the PPNR would
stop. And it's consistent, as you can see, relatively speaking, with what we calculated.
In respect to what that means for what's most binding. What it does mean is if you look at the analysis that we've done a
couple of years in a row now where we said using the CCAR results from the Fed, what would that imply, CET1 ratio
would need to be to pass. It had previously been a little less than 11% with the improved PPNR and therefore the
improved result at this point, it would be a little less than 10%.
So in that context, as we look forward sometime in the near future, maybe in the third quarter, to getting the 2017
CCAR changes in proposed form hopefully, it will alleviate to a degree a little bit of that pressure. But I still would
suggest to you, as we said at Investor Day that CCAR, depending on how the GSIB surcharges included in the
minimum, may become binding. It's not likely it will become binding, and so we'll continue to take that into
consideration as we go forward. And we are already taking into consideration as we think about optimizing against the
multiple binding constraints we have.

<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Hi, yes. Thanks, Marianne. So a quick question on the mortgage originations. The
correspondent channel didn't change all that much quarter on quarter, although I would have thought with seasonality
and a pickup in refis, that would have increased in the second quarter. Can you talk about how you're thinking about
correspondent mortgage originations? And given that refi volume looks strong at the start of the third quarter, should
we expect a pickup in correspondent in the third quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we think about using all of our channels based upon obviously the demand and our capacity
and our appetite to want to continue to close strongly for our customers. We've obviously also been focused in the
anticipation of it becoming a more purchase-oriented market very much on building out the retail channel and the retail
distribution channel, and that's been very successful. So there's less correspondent contribution this quarter. It is a lever
we will likely use going forward.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. And I know you can't really discuss too much on the legal side, but is there a right
way to think about legal expenses going forward, like an ordinary cost of doing business for a bank your size? Is it 1%
of revenues as an ongoing run rate for expected legal expenses going forward, or is it not the right the way to think
about it and it's just episodic?
<A - Marianne Lake>: At this point, we would still say it will be episodic. And while we are hopeful that the overall
structural cost will start coming down or has come down, and that's a good thing, there will still be potentially some
puts and takes in the legal space. There's no real way, obviously, of forecasting a run rate. I would just do what many of
you have done I think and go back and look up what the legal expense looked like in the years preceding the crisis and
make your own determination whether it's going to be structurally a little higher, but it probably wouldn't be multiples
of that.

Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks, good morning. Hey, Marianne, I was wondering just if you could – I know it's a little
backward-looking now and you've made your points already about what normal trading seasonality could be. But can
you help us understand the products that drove the really strong FICC trading and what happened in June? Was it
volumes? Was it spreads widening? And then I guess I would actually ask what you typically consider what normal
JPMorgan seasonality is, as you mentioned.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay. So it was particularly strong in rates, but nevertheless also very strong year over year in
currencies, emerging markets, credit trading, SPG, so it was pretty broad-based. But remember, you also have to think
about it relative to the equivalent course of last year, and we didn't have a particularly strong second quarter last year.
So on a relative basis, that is an important factor, but it was pretty broad-based. I would – it – more volume than
anything.
And then seasonality, I'm sorry. Look, it's anyone's guess, and I think you can go back and look over time. But last year
we saw – we had a weak second quarter, as I said, and so we didn't see as much seasonality. But if you look at the last
quarter's run rate, I don't know that that would be a bad place to start. Last year's third quarter run rate would not be a
bad place to start.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Understood, okay. And the second question just is on the wholesale reserve, you mentioned – it's
been nice to see the energy prices start to stabilize, and it seems like you were able to stabilize the amount of reserve
build outstanding aside from that one credit. What needs to happen for you to get even more comfortable where you
could see some of that reserve start to come out, underneath the context of that you're also growing the wholesale
business extremely fast as well?

<A - Marianne Lake>: I'm going to start with a couple of general comments, which is we talked about the fact that the
charge-offs that we've experienced in the quarter were credits that we had previously reserved for. So we're at the point
now where at least as a basic matter, as we're experiencing charge-offs, we feel like we're in a reasonably good reserve
position, notwithstanding that idiosyncratically there may be additional adds. I think what we would need to see is
continued firming of sentiment in the sector, continued access to capital markets to allow companies to repair their
balance sheets, and continued stabilization, if not improvement, in oil and gas prices. And so everything is constructive
on that path, but it needs to continue along the same path. And yes, we are growing our portfolio. And so even if it were
not for energy, we would, all other things equal, be adding to reserves. But there are also times to pay down. There are
a lot of puts and takes too.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Hi, Marianne. Thank you. Marianne, can you give us some color? Obviously, your consumer
loan growth has picked up quite nicely. You pointed to it's going to be at the higher end of the range for the year. What
are your guys saying on consumer behavior? Has it improved and they feel stronger about their own job prospects,
which is enabling them to borrow more? Are there any metrics that you guys are looking at from that end?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So just to say, we obviously have our own spend data to look at, and it continues – the card
spend is up 8% year on year. Energy continues to be a tailwind for consumers. The labor market continues to be solid
and improving, and sentiment is still good, housing still improving. So really, just looking at the same things you're
looking at, and we obviously have a slightly different lens to it. But all other things equal, consumers are in very good
shape, and demand is there for the product, and we've been investing outside of consumer in new products and – inside
consumer, sorry, in the Freedom Unlimited space and also in marketing. So we're growing not only because the
demand is there, but also because we're investing.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: I see. And then coming back to credit, obviously your first quarter results had the results of the
targeted Shared National Credit exam for oil. Traditionally, obviously, we have the Shared National Credit exam every
year, and second quarter results normally reflect that exam. Do your second quarter results reflect the Shared National
Credit exam, or is that going to...

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great, thanks. Marianne, just a couple of quick follow-ups on the Auto Lending business.
The originations came down a bit, and you talked about the dynamics around that previously in the quarter and at the
Investor Day. But when I poll auto lender or auto dealers, they say that where they had primarily seen you retreat was
from very high FICO, sort of super prime new lending and leasing, but that their experience with Chase remained very
consistent in the mid-FICO range, and I just wanted to see if that was consistent with your view internally.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Not specifically. I'm not sure. I hadn't polled the dealers myself, but we continue to have very
high FICO scores and, no, I'm not aware of that, but I can't comment.

<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, hey. Thank you very much. One of the things about what we saw in mortgage rates, I
mean, the 10-year dropping down to record levels in mortgage rates probably following right behind it. Can you give us
a little outlook? Are you seeing an uptick in refis? We've seen the refi indexes go up very high. And any outlook on
where you think the mortgage market's going to be in the next quarter or two?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so we are expecting refi to be stronger in the coming quarters. And the mortgage market,
as best we can tell, will be around $1.7 trillion, $1.8 trillion this year.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And the other – your follow-up question is, there are some news articles out there about
JPMorgan securitizing conforming loans. This hasn't really been done a lot by anybody. I don't know if you can address
that, the economics behind that or what the thought behind that instead of getting Fannie and Freddie wraps and just
securitizing them yourself.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. So we've done one and we're looking at more securitizations in the mortgage space, and
we're keeping a vertical stripe. We're retaining the loans on our balance sheet or the securities on our balance sheet, I
should say. And in doing that, we have been able to get private capital to take the majority of the lower credit risk and
get better capital treatment for ourselves in terms of the RWA that it attracts.

like 20% to 30% had FICO scores below 700. And I didn't know if that was for new originations or for the portfolio
overall that you're referring to.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks. Wanted to ask you a little bit about the focus everybody has on the flattening of the
treasury curve, but yet, earlier, you were able to say that going into next year, you would see a 2016 NII growth of $2
billion to $2.5 billion, only really fall to $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which means that that flattening of the yield curve is
very manageable. Just talk about asset yields as your earning asset yield actually went up one basis point and what
you've been able to see in the market versus what's happening in the treasury curve.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I mean, I'll just start by sort of orientating you on why that would be the impact for us. And
if you look at our balance sheet and you look at what we have in fixed rate loans versus what we have in either IOER or
in LIBOR loans, it's about $650 billion, and so we're much more sensitive to the front end of the rate curve. And if you
look at our earnings at risk disclosures, where 100 basis point parallel shift would be around $800 million (sic) [$3.1

billion]. And so obviously, we haven't seen and won't hopefully see anything of that order of magnitude. So that kind of
gives you an ability to sort of size up, notwithstanding compounding, why you've only seen our NII relative to prior
expectations come down by that much.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: In this particular quarter, your funding costs went up. Is that a lag effect from what – the rate
hike in kind of December still just now coming through or was there something else maybe more unusual about the
funding costs that we saw – that drove the margin down this particular quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So I think earlier on the call, somebody else asked the question and I made the comment
that it's really more related to the results from hedges of non-dollar debt, long-term debt. And so in the first quarter, the
dollar weakened. In the second quarter, it strengthened, and with some currency bases in the first quarter that we didn't
see in the second quarter, it really is – not to dismiss it, but it really is accounting and nothing really else than that.

Okay. Your next question is from the line Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hey, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Hi again. Just a follow-up on the card new originations. I know one of the key
things that you've done for many years is to focus on relationship lending, relationship offerings. And so our – when I
hear the 20% of the new originations are below FICO of 700, is that a shift from the relationship strategy that you have
or does it reflect the fact that you do have significant relationships on deposits, et cetera, with folks in that FICO band?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, no shift from our desire to want to be with engaged customers, and our rewards
programs, our products are all geared towards that. So it's really just a credit decision, and yes, we do have
relationships with many, many customers in that still near-prime space.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Thanks.

And your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Hi, thank you. As a follow-up, Marianne, your Consumer business obviously has been very,
very strong. Can you share with us, the update on clear exchange? It's expected to be rolled out later this year, and what
that might do to even grow the mobile business even more than it's growing now?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So look, obviously, P2P payments is – P2P real-time payments are very important to our
customers, so therefore, it's important to us. It's also important for us in the industry that it's done in a safe and secure
way. And so early warning, the full protection that they are able to provide, as well as bank level cyber security and the
absence of a need to provide your bank credentials, we think, is very strongly positive for our customers. And we
expect to see volume grow across that. As you know, we have QuickPay already and we saw reasonably significant
volume, $21 billion on QuickPay last year and growing. So I would expect to see more and more P2P payment, and it's
good for our customers, it's good for us.
<A - James Dimon>: So if you look at the whole payment space, Chase Paymentech is gaining share. ChaseNet is
doing very well. Chase Pay, we've signed up lots of different people, and one piece is the P2P. So today, right now, you
– Chase QuickPay, it's very easy within Chase to Chase. It's now just as easy to go from Chase to a bunch of other
banks, that I won't name now. And we've just started rolling out. And soon, it will be rolled out to 60% of American
banking accounts, and then we're going to make it available to all banks. So you will be able to go P2P, real-time,
through Chase QuickPay via special app for Chase QuickPay. It will also be branded another name, which isn't out yet,

which I think will be rolled out shortly. So I think it's a great success that the banks can get together and do this, and
this will be a great service which I think shows you the banks making progress on what you would've called prior
FinTech.
