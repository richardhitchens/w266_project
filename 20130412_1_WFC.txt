John G. Stumpf
Thank you, Jim, and thanks to everyone for joining us today.
In the first quarter, Wells Fargo generated another record quarter of earnings, and we achieved our 13th consecutive
quarter of earnings per share growth. We've achieved these results by doing what we have always done, remaining
focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers and helping them succeed financially. We accomplished this
in an environment that I think we would all agree wasn't ideal for generating earnings growth, demonstrating the
benefit of our diversified business model.
Our business is diverse in many ways. We are geographically diverse. We have over 80 different businesses that
perform differently in various economic environments, and our revenue is split fairly evenly between interest and
non-interest income. That kind of diversity lowers risk and enhances earnings stability and growth.
Let me start by highlighting examples of our strong performance in the first quarter compared to a year ago. We earned
a record $5.2 billion, up 22%, and also grew our earnings per share by 23%. We reduced our expenses and improved
our efficiency ratio by 180 basis points to 58.3%. Our core loan portfolio grew by $50.9 billion, up 8%. Our credit
losses reflected the benefit of a slowly improving economy and the high quality loans we've been originating over the
past few years. Our credit losses in the first quarter declined to 72 basis points, the lowest level since second quarter
2006. And our net charge-offs were down 41% from a year ago.
We also continued to benefit from our wonderful deposit franchise, growing deposits by $80 billion, up 9% from a year
ago, while reducing total deposit costs by five basis points.
Our growth reflects the benefit of our relationship model, as demonstrated by achieving record retail banking cross-sell
of 6.1 products per household. We also grew wholesale banking cross-sale to 6.8 products. And
Wealth/Brokerage/Retirement [WBR] cross-sell increased to 10.3 products.
We grew our return on assets, or our ROA, by 18 basis points to 1.49%, and our return on equity increased by 145 basis
points to 13.59%. We continued to increase our capital levels, growing our estimated Tier 1 common equity under
Basel III to 8.39%.
Returning more capital to our shareholders remains a priority, and we're extremely pleased that we were able to reward
them in the first quarter by increasing our common dividend to $0.25 per share. Our 2013 capital plan enables us to
further increase our dividend rate to $0.30 a share in the second quarter, subject of course to board approval, and also
increase our common stock repurchases in 2013 compared to our 2012 repurchase levels.
We're obviously off to a great start in 2013, and I couldn't be happier with the ability of our team members to continue
to make more loans and grow deposits, increase cross-sell, and reduce expenses, all while we continue to invest in our
franchise and adhere to our risk management discipline.
Let me conclude by taking a moment to share my thoughts on some industry issues and our current view on housing. A
topic that has been in the headlines a lot lately is important to Wells Fargo, our industry, and the economic recovery of
our country. That is, "Too big to fail." I believe our first priority as a country given the economy's tepid growth is
restoring economic health to America, including consumers and businesses large and small. Banks fuel and support
economic growth, and we need banks of all shapes and sizes to serve the diverse needs of a diverse economy. All banks
add value, and big banks have unique resources and capabilities to help the economy, including coast-to-coast
convenience, a broad range of products and services, and technology innovations serving large and small customers
alike.

There are ongoing discussions about the need for more regulation and other changes. We do not need additional
legislation aimed at big banks. Important and significant regulatory changes have been made since the financial crisis.
And we need to give existing regulations a chance to work, especially now when all our energy should be focused on
creating growth and new jobs. No bank should be considered too big to fail, and no taxpayer money should ever be
used to support a failing institution. Some claim that we receive a subsidy or have an unfair advantage from being
perceived as too big to fail. We disagree.
Wells Fargo supports economic growth in our country in a variety of ways, including employing one in 500 working
Americans and paying more than $10 billion in corporate income taxes last year. We are the nation's largest small
business lender, and increased new loan commitments to small businesses by 24% in the first quarter compared with a
year ago, and have grown loans to our middle market customers for 11 consecutive quarters. We also funded one in
four U.S. home mortgages in 2012, a total of over 2 million mortgage loans that helped our customers buy a home or
refinance their existing home at much lower rates. This is great for the overall economy because housing has led almost
every economic recovery in recent history.
The momentum from the housing rebound during 2012 has remained strong in the early months of 2013. Our near-term
outlook is for steady gains in home sales, building activity, and price appreciation. Housing affordability remains
excellent. The overhang from unsold properties is gone, and demographics are favorable.
Thank you again for joining us. Tim Sloan, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our results
this quarter. Tim?
Timothy J. Sloan
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the first half of our
quarterly supplement starting on page two, and then John and l will take your questions.
Wells Fargo had another outstanding quarter, with record earnings of $5.2 billion, up 22% from a year ago and up 2%
from the fourth quarter. Earnings per share reached a record $0.92, up 23% from the first quarter last year. We have
now achieved 13 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth and eight consecutive quarters of record EPS, quite
an achievement given the environment during that period.
Revenue was down this quarter, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter, a decline in equity gains from elevated levels
we had in the fourth quarter, and an expected decline in mortgage volumes. We were not surprised by these declines.
We had anticipated them, and we are very pleased with the strong fee growth we generated in a number of our other
businesses. Our quarterly results also reflect lower expenses, strong credit performance, and increased capital levels. As
John highlighted and you can see on page three, we had year-over-year growth in pre-tax pre-provision profit, net
income, EPS, both total and core loans, deposits, and a higher ROA and ROE.
Slide four highlights why we've been able to generate consistently strong results, the diversity of our revenue. We
remain balanced between fee and spread income, and our sources of fee income are highly diversified. Mortgage
banking accounted for 26% of our fee income this quarter and was 13% of our total revenue. We could not be more
pleased with the performance of our mortgage business.
What may surprise some of you is that trust and investment fees accounted for 30% of our fee income in the first
quarter and has generated more fee income than any other category, including mortgage, for the past four quarters. We
had strong year-over-year fee growth with a number of our businesses, with deposit service charges up 12%, brokerage
up 12%, trusts and investment up 6%, Investment Banking up 37%, card fees up 13%, merchant processing fees up
23%, and mortgage servicing income up 25%.
With over 80 businesses, they're not all going to grow every quarter. We are excited about the market share and
cross-sell growth we achieved this quarter across a number of our businesses. The diversity of our revenue enables us
to make the right long-term decisions and be disciplined in managing risk.

Overall, this was a pretty straightforward quarter from a balance sheet and an income statement perspective, but let me
highlight some key drivers to our results on the next two slides. On page five, you can see we continued to have
balance sheet growth this quarter, growing both loans and deposits. Even though we purchased a total of $17.8 billion
in agency MBS in the quarter, our short-term investments and Fed Fund sold balances increased by $6.5 billion as
average deposits continued to grow. We grew our securities available-for-sale portfolio by $13 billion, up 5.5% from
the fourth quarter. This is our largest linked-quarter increase since the fourth quarter of 2011. We took advantage of the
rate backed up at various times within the quarter as rates rose and yields became more attractive.
Turning to the income statement on page six, I've already highlighted some of the factors affecting the decline in
revenue we had this quarter, and I'll talk about net interest income and non-interest income drivers in a minute.
Non-interest expenses declined as expected, reflecting the elimination of elevated items we had last quarter and the
addition of some seasonally higher benefit costs in the first quarter.
Our effective tax rate this quarter was 31.9%, which included the benefit associated with the realization for tax
purposes of a previously written down investment. We expect the full-year effective tax rate to be higher absent
additional discrete benefits.
Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page seven, period end loans were up $33.5 billion
or 4% from a year ago, and grew by $392 million from the fourth quarter. Loan growth included the runoff of our
liquidating portfolio, which declined $17.4 billion from a year ago and $3.7 billion from the fourth quarter. Excluding
these liquidating loans, our core portfolio grew by $50.9 billion or 8% from a year ago, and was up $4.1 billion from
the fourth quarter. Our linked-quarter loan growth was impacted by the very strong quarter end growth we had last
quarter, and the fact that we were able to retain and add to those loan balances is a real positive.
Commercial loans grew $516 million in the quarter on growth in foreign loans. We saw declines in foreign loans
throughout most of last year. And the growth we achieved this quarter was in trade finance, reflecting increased
economic activity in Asia. Consumer loans declined $124 million, with growth in first mortgage and auto offset by
declines in junior lien mortgages and expected seasonal declines in credit card and student lending. The growth in first
mortgage loans benefited from the retention of $3.4 billion of new conforming fixed rate production. We currently do
not plan to retain additional first mortgage production, although we have the flexibility to do so if conditions change.
We continued to grow deposits in the first quarter, with period end deposits up $7.9 billion from the fourth quarter.
Average deposits were up $71.2 billion, or 8% from a year ago, and up $10.1 billion from the fourth quarter. We also
grew our primary consumer checking account customers by a net 2.1% from a year ago. These are basically active
customers who transact with us regularly.
We continued to lower our deposit costs, with average deposit costs of 15 basis points in the first quarter, down 1 basis
point from the fourth quarter and down 5 basis points from a year ago. We've successfully grown deposits while
reducing our deposit costs for nine consecutive quarters. Our ability to lower deposit costs while consistently growing
deposits reflects our longstanding relationship focus and pricing discipline.
As shown on page nine, tax equivalent net interest income was down 2% from the fourth quarter, primarily due to two
fewer days in the first quarter. Without this day count impact, net interest income would have been essentially flat.
Average earning assets grew $21.6 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting increases in short-term investments, loans,
and available-for-sale securities.
Our net interest margin declined by 8 basis points from the fourth quarter to 3.48%. This decline was driven by three
primary factors. First, our continued deposit growth caused cash and short-term investments to increase, reducing the
margin by 3 basis points. As I've highlighted in the past, our deposit growth is obviously beneficial to deepening
customer relationships and does not negatively impact net interest income, but, it is dilutive to the NIM. Second, 3
basis points of decline was due to lower variable income, including PCI loan resolutions and periodic dividends.
Finally, 2 basis points of the margin pressure was driven by the ongoing repricing of the balance sheet in this low-rate
environment, net of the growth in loans and AFS securities. Growing net interest income remains our focus, which we
believe we can grow even in this low-rate environment.

Non-interest income was down from the fourth quarter on lower gains on equity investments, which were highlighted
last quarter as being above average, and the expected decline in mortgage, which I'll highlight on the next slide.
Because of the seasonality of many of our businesses and the lower day count in the first quarter, it's best to look at the
year-over-year growth rates to demonstrate the momentum we've had in many of our businesses.
Deposit service charges increased 12%, reflecting customer growth and product and pricing changes. Brokerage fees
and trust and investment management fees grew, reflecting strong net asset flows and higher equity valuations.
Investment Banking fees were up 37% from a year ago, as we continued to do more business with our wholesale
customers. Card fees were up 13%, with growth driven by strong new account growth and higher credit and debit card
spend.
On page 11, we highlight some mortgage trends. While mortgage revenue was down this quarter as expected, we still
had strong originations of $109 billion, our sixth consecutive quarter of more than $100 billion in originations.
Mortgage revenue was reduced by $112 million this quarter from the retention of $3.4 billion of conforming first
mortgages. Gain-on-sale margins remained historically high. And as we've been saying for the past few quarters, we
would expect these margins to decline.
Origination volume for the rest of the year will obviously depend on continued strength in the housing market and
interest rates. But we expect volumes to remain relatively strong given the improved purchase market and the benefit of
the spring buying season. In fact, we've already seen the improved purchase market benefiting our results, with
originations for home purchases up 31% this quarter compared with a year ago. And also many of our existing
customers can still benefit from a refinance.
We added $309 million to our repurchase reserve this quarter, down $70 million from the fourth quarter. Our
repurchase reserve balance increased to $2.3 billion. Our repurchase reserve incorporates current demand levels,
considers all vintages, and anticipates probable future expected demands. Our servicing portfolio continued to perform
better than the industry. Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 6.54% in the first quarter, down 50 basis points
linked-quarter and down from 6.89% a year ago.
Turning to expenses on page 12, first quarter expenses declined $496 million from the fourth quarter, which had
included higher operating losses and a contribution to our foundation. As expected, our first quarter expenses included
$460 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as
$199 million in annual equity awards for retirement-eligible team members.
In addition to lower operating losses and charitable contributions, we reduced expenses in a number of other areas,
including occupancy, outside professional services, contract services, and advertising and promotion. We expect
expenses to be lower in the second quarter, reflecting lower employee benefit expenses that were seasonally higher this
quarter. But there will be normal growth in other areas, including ongoing investments in our business and normal
merit increases.
Our expense efficiency ratio of 58.3% was within our target range of 55% to 59% and was down 180 basis points from
a year ago. We've been focused on reducing expenses for years, as you can see the impact in our results. But we still
believe our expenses are too high and we can continue to improve our efficiency ratio.
Last quarter, we highlighted environmentally elevated costs, and we made progress in reducing these costs this quarter,
as shown on slide 13. And we expect them to continue to decline. We had approximately $50 million of continued costs
from the Independent Foreclosure Review this quarter, and these costs will be fully eliminated next quarter. Foreclosed
asset expense was down $26 million from the fourth quarter and down $109 million from a year ago, reflecting the
improvement in the housing market, which we expect will continue.
Mortgage revenue this quarter was reduced by $250 million for additions to our repurchase reserve not related to
current originations, and was reduced by $58 million to reflect higher servicing and foreclosure costs as some
foreclosure timelines continue to extend.

Turning to our segment results, starting on page 14, Community Banking earned $2.9 billion in the first quarter, up
25% from a year ago and up 2% from the fourth quarter. Retail Banking achieved a record cross-sell of 6.1 products
per household, up from 5.98 a year ago. To better meet our customers' financial needs and improve cross-sell, we
continually invest in our business, including new store designs, improved technology, and adding bankers. We grew
platform banker FTE by 1,528 from a year ago and by 478 in just the first quarter alone.
Our credit card business continued to have strong account growth, with a record of 577,000 new accounts in the first
quarter, up 18% from a year ago and up 31% from the fourth quarter. Our household penetration increased to 34.1%, up
from 29.9% a year ago. Credit card balances are down from the fourth quarter, reflecting normal seasonality; but are up
10% from a year ago, reflecting strong account growth.
We also had continuing momentum in our auto business, and we're now the industry's leading auto lender. We
generated record auto originations in the first quarter of $6.8 billion, up 10% from a year ago and up 27% from the
fourth quarter.
We also successfully met the needs of our small business customers, with business checking accounts up 2.9% from a
year ago. We also extended $4.2 billion of net new loan commitments to small business customers this quarter, up 24%
from a year ago.
Wholesale Banking earned record net income of $2 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from a year ago and up 1% from
the fourth quarter. Wholesale Banking results continued to benefit from steady loan growth, with loans having grown
for 10 consecutive quarters. Industry loan growth remains tepid, but our relationship focus has enabled us to grow
market share, and we've been able to generate middle market loan growth for 11 consecutive quarters. This growth has
occurred as we maintained our pricing and risk discipline. Our risk and underwriting discipline is also reflected in the
$8 million in loan loss recoveries in Wholesale Banking this quarter. The last time Wholesale was in a net recovery
position was nearly seven years ago, in the second quarter of 2006.
Asset management fees were up 8% from a year ago and were up 2% from the fourth quarter. Total assets under
management increased $11.4 billion from the fourth quarter, with growth in all asset types. The growth reflects the
benefit from favorable markets and $4.1 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. Wholesale Banking's continued focus
on building relationships resulted in cross-sell of 6.8 products per relationship, up from 6.6 a year ago.
Wealth, Brokerage, and Retirement earned $337 million, up 14% from a year ago, driven by strong growth in
asset-based fees and higher brokerage transaction revenue. Earnings were down 4% from the fourth quarter, reflecting
seasonally higher personnel expenses and lower net interest income.
Wealth, Brokerage, and Retirement has continued to successfully grow client assets, benefiting from improved markets
and growing market share. WBR client assets reached a record $1.5 trillion, up 7% from a year ago, including strong
growth in retail brokerage managed account assets, up $46 billion or 16%, driven by strong net flows in market
performance as well as growth in average core deposits, up 10% to $149 billion. The growth in managed account assets
in the first quarter will benefit our revenue from advisory fees next quarter since they are priced on a quarterly lag.
In addition, WBR continued to effectively partner with retail banking to meet all the financial need of our customers,
increasing cross-sell to 10.33 products per household, up from 10.16 a year ago.
Turning to credit quality on page 17, we had significant improvement across our commercial and consumer portfolios.
First quarter net charge-offs declined to 72 basis points of average loans, the lowest level since the second quarter of
2006. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only $90 million, or 10 basis points of average loans. Obviously, this is
very strong performance, and we would expect commercial losses to remain low but probably fluctuate around these
levels.
Consumer losses declined to 123 basis points, with strong improvement in our real estate secured portfolios. These
portfolios should continue to benefit from our underwriting discipline and the continued improvement in the housing
market. Reflecting this improved credit performance, we released $200 million in loan loss reserves in the first quarter.
Absent a significant deterioration of the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2013.

Non-performing assets decreased $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter and were down $3.8 billion or 14% from a year
ago, with declines in both non-accrual loans and foreclosed assets. Loans 90 days or more past due decreased $75
million from the fourth quarter and were down 17% from a year ago, with improvement in both commercial and
consumer loans. Early-stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also declined significantly from the fourth
quarter and a year ago, with balances down 19% and with improvements in every portfolio on a linked-quarter basis.
As shown on page 19, our capital levels continued to grow. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio improved to 10.38%, up 26
basis points from the last quarter. The ratio this quarter was negatively impacted by 25 basis points from the
implementation of Basel 2.5, which became effective on January 1. This implementation was reflected in our 2013
CCAR plan and did not impact our ratio under Basel III, as its impact has historically been included in this calculation.
Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III capital proposals increased to 8.39% in the first quarter.
We purchased 16.6 million shares, but issued 39 million shares in the first quarter, which was seasonally high because
of employee benefit plan issuances. Our 2013 capital plan included an increase in common stock repurchases compared
with our 2012 repurchases.
Our capital plan also included a $0.30 per share second quarter dividend, which we will recommend to our board at our
meeting this month. This would be an increase of 36% over the second quarter dividend last year and a 20% increase
over our first quarter dividend this year, which we had increased to $0.25 a share.
Our diversified model provides us with many opportunities to grow earnings, as highlighted by our 13 consecutive
quarters of EPS growth. On slide 20, we summarize some of the momentum we've realized throughout our businesses
that I've highlighted on the call. The market share gains, customer growth, increases in loans, deposits, assets under
management positions us very well for 2013. We also have the opportunity to further reduce expenses, benefit from
improvement in credit, and deploy liquidity prudently to meet loan demand or to invest.
In addition, we believe that the housing market will continue to improve, which will not only increase economic growth
for our country but should benefit our revenues, reduce environmentally elevated expenses, and lower losses in our real
estate secured portfolios.
In summary, we had exceptional results this quarter, earning more than we've ever earned in the history of Wells Fargo.
Our EPS grew by 23% from a year ago, and we reduced expenses by 5%. Pre-tax pre-provision profit increased 2%.
And credit continued to show significant improvement, with losses down 41%. And total charge-offs declined to 72
basis points. ROA grew to 1.49%, within our targeted range of 1.3% to 1.6%. And ROE increased to 13.59%, also
within our targeted range of 12% to 15%. We continued to grow our capital levels while returning more capital to our
shareholders by increasing our dividend and continuing to buy back our shares.
We'll now open up the call for questions.

<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Good morning. My first question, John, is on your capital priority. It's clear that the dividend
is on top of the list and your yield is clearly best in class. However, I wonder how you think about weighing your
buyback opportunities versus strategic opportunities for acquisition because on one hand, most of your shareholders are
clamoring for more buyback and to actually see shares outstanding, the count reduced. But on the other, you have – not
a lot of banks that have your currency; I guess if you could give us an insight on how you're thinking and weighing
these issues. An additionally, does the trajectory of mortgage have anything to do with favoring one strategy over the

<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure, so thank you for the question. We have stated publicly, and I know you know this, that
our payout ratio, we have targeted 50% to 65%. I believe the first call in capital is to grow the business, and we have
ample capital to do that and meet those payout targets.
With respect to M&A, remember that the biggest users of capital on an M&A side would be on the deposit side of the
franchise, of which of course we are at our federal statutory number or close to it. And the acquisitions that we have
talked about being interested in would be mostly bolt-on businesses to our existing portfolio suite of the 80 different
businesses we do here, and predominantly in the United States. So we've done some portfolios in the past. We're still
interested in things around Wealth/Brokerage/Retirement, but I don't see that as a huge draw on our capital. This
company is uniquely positioned that we're producing terrific returns in absolute terms and in relative terms. There's
plenty of liquidity and performance there to meet a number of goals; again, investing our business doing strategic
bolt-ons where they make sense, and returning capital to our shareholders at the kind of levels we've talked about.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Got it. And my follow-up question was for Tim. Speaking of liquidity, I've already gotten a
few questions in my inbox regarding how high your liquidity levels remain. I guess could you give – obviously, deposit
growth continues to be strong. But can you give us a sense in terms of why you're keeping it at this high of a ratio
relative to your earning assets? Is it you're afraid of the duration risk? Does it speak to a question mark on the duration
of deposit flows? Or is it, as John alluded to, warehousing some cash in order to take advantage of some of the bolt-on
opportunities that could be out there?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Erika, that's a really good question. Because our liquidity levels are low, we view that as a
real positive for the company. Clearly, the first call on our liquidity is always going be for our customers, and we've
seen good loan growth year over year. Our core loans are up $50 billion. But even with that, as you point out, we've
seen very strong deposit growth. We did deploy some of that liquidity that wasn't needed for loan growth in the first
quarter at a slightly higher rate than what we've seen in the last year when we saw rates back up. As you'll recall, we
saw rates back up toward the end of the fourth quarter and we purchased some securities. They dipped back down and
then they backed up again throughout the quarter, and we purchased $17.8 billion of MBS.
Our plan continues to be to make the right long-term decisions and the right risk-adjusted decisions in terms of how we
deploy our excess liquidity. We don't want to significantly increase duration. So our liquidity is up. We view that as a
positive, and we're looking forward to deploying it in the future.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Okay, I'll step aside. Thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Thanks, good morning, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Joe.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Now that you're starting to see a more sustained slowdown in mortgage applications, pipeline,
and originations, how are you thinking about the head count in this division, and have you begun to address some of the
variable costs there?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We actually added to the number of team members in the mortgage business in the fourth
quarter because we wanted to improve the customer service in the business. And we've seen a reduction in the time
from app to close go from about 90 days to 60 days, which we view as a real positive and a competitive advantage.

The mortgage business is still very strong. At $109 billion, as we mentioned, it's our sixth consecutive quarter of
originations above $100 billion. And we started this quarter with a fairly strong pipeline at $74 billion on an absolute
basis and relative to almost most quarters we've ever been in business. So the business continues to be strong. And as I
mentioned, we also saw an increase in purchase activity in the first quarter, up 31% year over year.
I think the other positives in the business are we've now seen an extension of the HARP [Home Affordable Refinance
Program] program. And with rates rallying again, we've got more customers that could take advantage of a refinance as
well as the fact that as housing values go up, there would be more customers that could potentially take advantage of a
refinance. So I think we're very bullish on the business.
That said, our expectation is that it's probably likely that revenues and margins will come down a little bit. All that said,
to the extent that it comes down further than we think, we'll adjust cost as our team has done through various cycles on
a number of occasions. So that may happen this quarter; it may not. I hope it doesn't happen because it means revenues
will continue to be growing, so that would be nice.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Right. I guess along those lines too, what about other opportunities to sustain origination
volumes just given some of the capacity issues you've had in recent quarters and maybe perhaps more proactively
marketing to tap into some of this pent-up demand?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Joe, I think that's a really good point. And the way that our team thinks about it and one of
the reasons we want to make sure that we're adequately staffed is that we do view the purchase market as a big
opportunity. And so that as refinancing volume comes down, which it has come down over the last few quarters, we
have our sales folks out there and our bankers out there being more proactive with our customers.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: That's a great point, Tim. Joe, this really plays to our strength, our One Wells Fargo working
as a team. We have 30,000-plus bankers in our stores. Not every one of our customers who calls us their bank has their
mortgage with us. And we've kept our relationships with our realtor friends and our builder friends during the big refi
time, and this is really where it really pays off. And in Tim's comments, he mentioned that purchase volume is up 31%
year over year. So that's really important for us.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Okay, thanks so much.

Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning. Good morning, Tim.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Good morning, John. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit, Tim, on the
factors that helped keep the mortgage gain on sale flat at very healthy levels this quarter and what will be the puts and
takes on that going forward and if you have any outlook there?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, good question. John, because at 2.56%, it's historically high and really right on top of
what we saw in the fourth quarter. Recall that our accounting convention is to recognize gain on sale when we – most
of the gain on sale when we book the loan. And so the primary/secondary spread changes in the quarter and rate
movements was really beneficial.
I think in terms of outlook, let me throw some numbers at you, and then you can conclude what you think the right gain
on sale margin might be. If you look over the last four years, and I'm going to use some yearly averages, the highest
average we had was not surprisingly in 2012, which was 2.33%. The lowest average that we had, which was in 2011,

was 1.61%. And so when you step back and look at 2.56%, I think it's reasonable, as we said in the fourth quarter, to
assume that the gain on sale is going to come down. My guess is it will probably end up somewhere in the range of
between 1.61% and 2.33%, but I don't know exactly where it's going be within that range.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And in terms of the mortgage put-backs, at what point will you know it's okay
to start using some of that reserve? With credit, we can see when the inflows slow and you start to see charge-offs
come down and forward looking. On the put-back front, when do you start maybe consuming or stop needing to add to
that reserve?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: John, I hope it's sooner rather than later, and I don't know for sure. But when we think about
our mortgage repurchase reserve, we not only look at what the current demands are, but also what expected demands
are. And so it has come down now for the last three or four quarters, which we're pleased with, but we just haven't seen
that yet. We need to be very comfortable that not only current demands but also future expected demands are going
come down. Hopefully, it will be in the next few quarters.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: John, an improving housing market sure is a good sign regarding that issue.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yes.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: It's not the only thing that influences it, but that's good news.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And, Tim, one quick follow-up on the share count issue. We know that – you know
that shareholders are hoping to see the share count come down, and it hasn't yet. We know in 2013 your plan involves
more buybacks. So I guess the question is does it also involve more issuance, or do you hope to have the same issuance
this year that you did last year such that your net share count would come down this year given that you're doing more
buybacks?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Right. So, John, I certainly appreciate that share count is a big focus. Candidly, earnings per
share is a bigger focus for us, and we've been pleased to be able to grow that for the last 13 quarters. I think that – when
you think about the fact that last year that we repurchased 120 million shares, the likelihood – again, this is a function
of our share price that we repurchase shares at, the likelihood is that we will probably repurchase more shares than we
did last year and probably repurchase more shares than we issue, and we'll know in a year.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Right.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: But again, our primary focus is going to be growing earnings per share. But make no
mistake; our capital plan calls for an increase in share – total share repurchase dollars versus what we did last year, and
we are going be repurchasing our shares at a greater rate this year than last.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, and one quick follow-up on something you said in January. I think you said
that in January you hoped to grow net interest income dollars even though it's a tough environment and you've got
some pressure on spreads and things like that. You're focused on the net interest income dollars and you're having some
earning asset growth. I know in the first quarter you had day count pressuring the NII dollars. But do you still hope to
grow that in 2013?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, we do. I think that when you look at net interest income, we could have had the same
conversation a year ago and had the same concerns and they would have been absolutely valid. But last year, we were
able to grow our net interest income by over $0.5 billion, and our expectation is that he we should be able to grow it
this year. Again, it's harder to see this quarter because of the two fewer days. But if you step back and look at the last
three quarters, you can see that notwithstanding the decline in net interest margin that the net interest income has more
or less bottomed at about $10.6 billion.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it, okay. Thanks, Tim.

Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Matt. How are you doing?
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good, thanks. Just following up on the net interest income dollar question, as you think
about the relationship of balance sheet growth and the NIM percent, do we get an acceleration of balance sheet growth,
or do we get less NIM pressure to drive those dollars higher? How would you envision that playing out?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Recall that the primary driver for the decline in the net interest margin over – just look over
the last three years, 12 quarters. The decline has been 79 basis points. Almost three-quarters of that decline has been
driven by the fact that deposits are growing. Again, we view that as a very positive sign for the long-term growth of the
company. When you pull that out, that net differential is really the decline in overall margin. So my bet is that if we see
further net interest margin decline, it's probably more likely going be driven by deposit growth than by margins. But
there's no question that the net interest margin in this interest rate environment as the balance sheet reprices continues
to be under pressure. But again, let me emphasize. We believe that we can grow net interest income just like we did last
year, year over year, even in this environment.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then separately, the charge-offs came down sharply. And you commented both
on the commercial piece and broadly speaking on the consumer. But at the level that we're at on the real estate related
areas in the consumer, is this a – I don't want to say normal delinquency. Is this a clean level, or did some of the
upfronting of charge-offs in the second half of last year related to regulatory changes, did that impact these numbers at
all?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, and I wouldn't describe it as upfront. And clearly, there was some OCC guidance that we
had for a portion of the portfolio that we needed to address and others in the industry addressed this. I would view this
as that the charge-off level and the credit performance as just being terrific, and I don't believe that this is the bottom in
terms of consumer loan losses.
Again, the commercial losses are a little bit different story. At ten basis points, it doesn't take a lot of change to increase
those or even decrease them a little bit. But in terms of consumer loan losses at 123 basis points, our guess is that
assuming the economy continues to improve and assuming that we're going to continue to see an improvement in the
residential housing market, which we both – we think is going happen, we should continue to see a decline.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just last clarification, you talked about the tax rate bouncing up a little bit.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Right.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: What number should we be using for the rest of the year?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I don't know what the number is going to be. We just wanted to make sure that you all didn't
use the tax rate in the first quarter and then just annualize it. I think it will be closer to more historical levels that we've
seen in other quarters or other years where we haven't had some tax benefit like we had in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, so maybe 32% to 33% if I look at the last few years?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, that's a reasonable range, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, thank you very much.

<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Moshe.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Hi, good morning. You alluded to purchase mortgage market stepping up. But isn't the scale
tough just given how much of your originations are refis right now? How do you – I guess if we look at let's say
projections for the industry, how should we think about your market share and what that would mean for originations
for the balance of the year?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Moshe, I think you make a very fair point. And we didn't mean by pointing out that purchase
money activity was up 31% year over year that that in and of itself is going to take the place of the decline in refinance
volume because, as we've said and you've seen in our numbers, that our total mortgage volumes are coming down. I
think what we're seeing is that they're not coming down as maybe as fast as some folks might have thought because of
the improvement in the purchase money market.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Got it.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think it's also factual that when you look at the market share that we have in the refinance
market, it's higher because of the size of our servicing portfolio than it would be in the purchase money market. But
again, that's why we want to make sure we have more folks in the business being proactive with our customers so that
we can grow our purchase money activity. John, I don't know if you wanted to comment.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: The way we think about this, we think this is a really important consumer product. And we
have made investments in this business and have performed through a variety of cycles. We happen to think now, yes,
no question that there will be less refinancing. A lot of people have done the refinancing. But even in that area, the
average rate in our servicing portfolio is just shy of 4.7%. The Street rate is at the end of the day 100 basis points less
than that, so there is still refinance volume.
But on the purchase money side, we're going into the stronger selling season now. We have over 6,000 banking stores
or bankers who are dealing with customers every day. We have 10,000-plus home mortgage consultants out with their
relationships. And we will get our share hopefully plus some. If it's not there, we can adjust quickly because we have
the experience to bring our costs down and reflect that. But remember, housing is improving every day. More people
have more equity in their homes. Americans have not lost their emotional attachment to home ownership. That can't be
for everyone, but we want to be there to help as many customers as we possibly can. We like this business a lot.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: And, Moshe, let me give you a couple other numbers to put it in perspective. A year ago, our
pipeline starting the second quarter was $79 billion, and now we're at $74 billion. And 35% of that $74 billion pipeline
is purchase money activity, and that's an increase from about 24% a year ago. So it is having some impact, which we're
very excited about.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Perfect.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: In the overall market, the overall purchase – still it's low by historical standards.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Sure.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: So a normal market is a pretty good market for us.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Two quick follow-ups. One is your correspondent share fell this quarter. JPMorgan reported
today; they're the number two player. Theirs went up. Could you talk about what your thought process is and maybe
related to the issue of whether you're thinking about selling either actual MSRs or a servicing strip if that asset were to
increase from here.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: The decline in share in the correspondent business, there wasn't anything in particular going
on. I think it's just a very competitive market.

But as it relates to the MSR, you probably saw this week that we did sell some reverse mortgage MSR. That really – I
wouldn't describe that as a strategic change in terms of our thought about the overall MSR. That just reflects the fact
that we got out of that business, originating those loans a couple of years ago. And we thought it was prudent to
continue to reduce our servicing activity in that business. There has really been no change in our view of the MSR. It's
still an important asset for the company. And from time to time, we may decide to sell. But again, I wouldn't read too
much into the sale of the reverse mortgage MSR.

Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yes, hi. How are you guys doing? I don't want to keep on harping on the mortgage, but we saw
yesterday that HARP got extended for two years. I think you guys have said publicly that you think the bulk of your
HARP has already been – you already originated or refinanced the bulk of your HARP. Do you think that if there is a
good solid PR program from the White House to get people off the sidelines, do you think that – and a two-year
extension, do you think you could see another wave of HARP mortgages being done?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, I don't know if it will be another wave. Our HARP originations in the first quarter were
10%, which was down from the mid-teens that we saw last year. I think this is a positive. The HARP program has been
a very successful program. I think the numbers nationwide are over 2.2 million homeowners have been able to
refinance via HARP, so it has been a successful program. I don't think it will be a new wave, but a continuation is very
good.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then to follow up on the securities portfolio, was that just being optimistic on the rates
going up because you feel rates will remain relatively flat, or is this something when we see rates go up, we could see
the portfolio grow in that category?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Paul, I think if we see rates go up from here, you could see us being as active as we were in
the first quarter. We had a fairly, on a percentage basis and also absolute levels, pretty sizable backup in the first
quarter. If you recall, there were some days when the ten-year was above 2.20% and MBS was very attractive. And
from our perspective, given the amount of liquidity that we have and given that we want to maintain a pretty steady
duration and we don't want to take excessive credit risks, it just makes sense to take advantage of those opportunities.
We're not going to deploy all of it in one day. But again, given our liquidity, to be able to deploy $17.8 billion in the
quarter on an opportunistic basis was very good from our perspective.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Paul, as Tim mentioned I think in his comments, this is really we think a strength for the
company to have the liquidity available, and we make risk/return decisions every day. And when we think it's favorable
and in our shareholders' interest, we will deploy that. And if we don't think the right risk/return ratio is there, we're
willing to pass and we don't have to do something. But this is a source of strength.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And does it surprise you guys a little bit because I know it does me, where we're seeing the
housing market start to pick up, we're seeing homebuilders building homes, but there's still really not a lot of loan
growth being created. Do you see that changing over the next couple quarters?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Do you mean loan growth for homebuilders or for consumers?
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: No, just for the overall economy. That's one of the areas of activity we're seeing, but it doesn't
seem like to be materializing in the overall economy.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I wouldn't jump to any conclusions about loan growth in the industry in the first quarter. If
you look at the HA data, for the last few years the first quarter tended be a seasonally low quarter. And what I would

do, and again this is just me. I'd take the first quarter decline for the industry and also then add to that the fourth quarter
that we saw last quarter increase and probably average those together. And remember, the fourth quarter of last year
was extremely high because of some of the changes and decisions that folks were making because of the potential
changes in taxes and the code and so on. So again, I think what we're seeing in the industry is steady loan growth if you
average over the last few years at about 1%-ish on a quarterly basis. We've been fortunate because we've been able to
grow a multiple of that.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: If you look, Paul, at some of the drivers, if you look at household formation, if you look at
cost of financing, cost of housing, there's a lot of tailwinds, a lot of favorable attributes. Now nobody can predict what's
going to happen. But if anything today, there's probably a shortage of housing on the market.

Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Betsy.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Just on your last comment, shortage of housing in the market, that's a pretty powerful
statement. Is there any specific geographies that you're seeing that in?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: It's not true in every market and in every price range. But when I'm out talking with realtors
and customers, the amount of supply, especially in the lower end or starter houses, there's not a lot of supply out there.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Go ahead. No, I have nothing...
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: All right. So then, obviously, that has some powerful implications for your business
model over the next year or so as long as we keep rates low, and I guess that's kind of my question. Do you feel like
part of this housing improvement that we're seeing is a function of where rates are, clearly at 3.7%, 3.3%, in that range?
That's got to be fueling part of the boom here. And to what degree are you building your business based on the current
interest rate environment? To what extent – how do you protect yourself for the Fed deciding to stop QE3?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Betsy, I would say that the housing market is as much driven by confidence and by about
improvements in values as it is with rates. I don't know of many people who are on the sidelines and say I'll only buy a
house if the rate is 3.25% and I won't buy at 4.25%. I think it's about jobs, about confidence, about feeling good about
where things are going. Surely, rate is – when you think of when you buy a house, it's what you make, what the house
costs, and what your financing costs are the big three. But housing is improving at different levels, but virtually
everywhere that we see in the country.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: And then, Betsy, the second part of your question, which is related just to the interest rate
risk and how do we protect ourselves, we're actually positioned very well over the medium and longer term to benefit
from an increase in interest rates; again, as long as it's not such a large increase that it affects – negatively affects
economic growth. But we're positioned very well, and it's one of the reasons why we continue to maintain the level of
liquidity that we have.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Great, and can I just follow up on one other thing?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure.

<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: I think you mentioned earlier on that you're not planning on retaining any more of the
conventional production as you have over the last couple of quarters, and I guess I'm just wondering how you got to
that decision. Gain on sale coming down over the next couple of quarters, I would think it would tip in favor of
retaining versus securitizing, but I'm sure you're thinking of a broader range of inputs on that. Maybe you can help us
understand your logic.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure, that's a good question. Recall that the primary driver for the reason why we wanted to
hold some of our first mortgage production in the third and the fourth quarters of last year was because interest rates
and investment alternatives given the level of liquidity were just very unattractive from our perspective, if you think
about where rates were in almost all categories in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of last year. That's the primary
driver, not necessarily the gain-on-sale margin. So as we looked at the first quarter, and we mentioned this last quarter,
we saw the opportunity to invest because rates seemed like they were backing up and we took advantage of that rather
than hold our first mortgage production, so that's going be the driver. It's investment alternatives, not gain-on-sale
margins.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: But certainly if for whatever reason rates would really rally from here and we could see a
repeat of the third and the fourth quarter, we would reconsider holding some of the mortgages again. That remains an
option, and that's another strength of the business.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Correct, we don't preclude that.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right, okay. Yes, because you did get it back up obviously in rates and now rates have
come back in, so you'll be nimble is basically what you're saying.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Correct.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: As nimble as we can be.

Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. Back to net interest income, and you said that's a focus, but at least linked-quarter it stunk.
And I know the day count and you seemed pretty confident that $10.6 billion is a bottom. And I'm just trying to figure
out what would make you so confident? Would it be anything to do with the accretable yield going forward, given
better credit quality? The balance sheet repricing maybe only hurt 2 basis points. Do you feel better there? Or is it
really just you added all these securities opportunistically and that will play out for a full quarter, and we should see
that in the second quarter?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, Mike, I'm always careful not to disagree with you, but I wouldn't say that $10.4 billion
of net interest income stunk. It was down but if you just added two extra days, and it's an issue of the calendar, it would
have been $10.6 billion, And we actually think in the environment, when you look at the entire industry, that that was
very good performance. But having said that, I think that the answer to your second question is it's all of the above. We
have consistently been able to grow our loans at a multiple of what the market's growing. That's number one. And
number two, we are going to continue to take advantage and redeploy or deploy our liquidity when we see rates back
up like we did in the first quarter and we bought $17.8 billion worth of securities.

And so again, we could have had the same conversation. I think we actually did about a year ago when we looked at
where rates were and where loan growth was. We were coming – the industry was coming off a seasonal low just like it
is this quarter. And so our perspective is that we can continue to – we can grow net interest income and in the next
quarter, we'll see if we were able to do it, but that's our goal.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And of the benefit of the securities that you put on, was that mostly the latter part of the quarter
or the early part? In other words, do we actually see it in the numbers yet?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, that's a good question, Mike. Recall that when we talked about our first quarter
earnings, we gave some specific guidance that we had purchased some MBS at the end of December when rates backed
up a fair amount, and then you saw a rally again. They backed up again in early January and we were purchasers. And
then they went back and forth a bit, and then we saw a nice backup about a month or so ago and so we were pretty
active, which is why the average was less than what the total purchases were. And so you're going see more of the
benefit of those purchases as we go through this quarter.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Got it, and then the second question relates to the efficiency target. You are on the upper end of
your target range. And there's the article today talking about your new mini-branches. And I know you've talked about
that in the past, but now it seems like the execution phase. Can you just give some sense of how many of your 6,000
branches might go to this mini form, if it's correct, and they cost half as much and any other color you can give?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure. In fact, Mike, I was in Washington this last week and went by and actually toured our
first neighborhood store, or you'd think it was a branch. And it's a terrific combination of using technology and
convenience both for hours and after-hours, so it really is a dual purpose that way.
Our view around distribution is that it's more of a distribution community where you have stores and ATMs and online
and mobile and phones all working together, and that's part of the magic of how we deepen cross-sell and how we build
customer loyalty. We don't have a plan per se that says so many of the neighborhood versus so many of traditional, but
they all work because even our Millennial customers, who are much more skewed towards self-service and mobile
devices, still want and need stores. And in some places you can't get a 3,000 or 4,000 square foot space where 1,000
square feet works just as well, in fact, better. So look for us to do more. It's a test-and-learn mode, and it's going to help
us grow and deepen relationships.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Marty.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Hey. My question focuses on the operating expenses, and you've talked about the
seasonal impact. If I add those up, there's about $750 million in that number related to the seasonal uptick in first
quarter. That starts to roll out as you move to the second quarter but you mentioned the merit increase. I didn't know
how much, if you could just give us some proportion of the $750 million that might get used up in the merit increase as
you go to the second quarter.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: It could be a few hundred million dollars, Marty. And I think that – I wouldn't take that $700
million or $750 million and just deduct it and say that's what it's going be the second quarter. We're going have an
impact from merit. I think we're also going to continue to invest in both people as well as technology and products. So
we want to continue to grow the franchise. So I wouldn't just deduct that and call that our expenses for the second
quarter.

<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then when you look at the net charge-off rate dropping as significantly as it did, our
provision number that your came through with was pretty consistent with what we were expecting. But the composition
was so different in a sense of net charge-offs being lower and release of or recapture of loan loss allowance being a lot
less. Does the lower net charge-offs and improvement in non-performers eventually start bleeding through into
recapture, or how do you see that playing out in the sense of the magnitude going forward?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, I think you make a fair point. And that's one of the reasons why we reiterated that we
do expect in the future to continue to see reserve releases absent some big deterioration in the economy. So our
expectation is that we will see more releases, Marty. And again, it's going to be a function of the improvement in credit,
and we've seen that now consistently. I think one of the important things to remember is that our reserve releases are a
relatively small part of our total earnings. I think it's less than 5% this quarter.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Exactly. And lastly, I just wanted to ask you about the $74 billion pipeline. Typically
seasonally, there's a swoon in applications and activity, and that starts to pick back up as we get into spring and
summer. That would be a pull-through. You can see originations still hovering in the $100 billion range given your
starting point's already three-fourths of the way there for the quarter. I just thought I'd ask about that, your thoughts
there.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, Marty, I think you're correct in that the pipeline was very strong. It was about what we
saw a year ago at this time. And again, I think that the complexion of the pipeline is a little bit different because a
bigger percentage relates to purchase money activity. I don't know what the originations are going be for the quarter.
I think the other thing to remember, and I referred to it but probably could have been a little bit clearer on that, is that
we have the appropriate level of staffing to take advantage of opportunities out there in the mortgage business. That has
allowed us to reduce the application-to-close period from about 90 days to 60 days. And so you can't really see that in
the numbers, but that would portend some pretty good origination activity. But in terms of what the number is going be,
we don't know for sure.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Appreciate it, thanks.

Your next question will come from the line of Greg Ketron with UBS.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Greg.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: I have a question on servicing. I know you've touched on this a number of different ways.
But when you think about servicing going forward and where it is today at around 70 basis points, if you just look at
the residential side of it and anticipate the rates do drift higher, you've got a slowdown of prepayment speeds,
potentially you could see a pretty sizable write-up in MSR valuations, $5 billion, $6 billion if we got back to 100 to 110
basis points ultimately. Would it be your anticipation that you would recognize most of that or hedge that away as that
develops? Could that be a future source of income in terms of running a balanced mortgage model?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: It certainly could. I don't know if I would necessarily agree with the $5 billion to $6 billion.
But certainly we could see an increase in value of the servicing asset as rates go up. I'd also just want to make clear that
as housing values go up, that actually – when you think about modeling that out, that also potentially has a negative
impact on the servicing value because it's more likely that our customers could refinance as valuations go up. So there's
a little bit of a put and take there. But there's no question that one of the benefits of the balanced model is that when

you've got a servicing asset and rates go up, it becomes more valuable. So that could be a source of earnings in the
future.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Okay. And that's something you wouldn't necessarily hedge away given the fact you were
in the balanced model?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We currently – well, we want to make sure that we've got the mortgage servicing asset
appropriately hedged. And we're not going to speculate on interest rates in terms of how we hedge that assets because
we could be – that asset because we could just as well be right as wrong. My guess is that we will get some benefit, but
it's not as if we're going make a decision one morning to completely un-hedge the portfolio because we think – or the
asset because we think that rates are going to go up. That would be a very, very bad decision.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, let me just reiterate what Tim said here. Part of our balanced model is we don't
speculate. We don't try to speculate in this business around where we think interest rates are going to go. We could
have been sitting here a year ago and said they have to be going up, and actually they went down. So the balanced
model is more around when rates are higher, we have more value in the servicing asset. And when rates are lower, we
tend to do more gain-on-sale with production. Now surely, those two are related to one another, but we're not in the
business of speculating where rates or taking a view on rates and then adjusting the hedge accordingly.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Okay, great; and then, John, a question for you. I know at Investor Day last year, you had
spent time talking about the Wachovia franchise in the Eastern U.S. and how you had the opportunity there. And as you
achieved the record earnings and deposit growth in the revenues and earnings such as Wealth Management, can you
give us some color on how that's progressing, what leverage you are receiving out of the Wachovia franchise at this
point and maybe a percentage of the way through that optimization?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure. Well, first of all, I want to tip my hat to all the team members who helped make that
merger the best one I've been around and was the largest, of course, in U.S. bank history. And it's so rewarding to see
the activity happening in the East with adding stores, adding team members in stores. In fact, if you look at productivity
numbers, sales per day, referrals, cross-sell, the gap is closing rapidly. In fact, some of the best innovations and ideas
we're getting now for future growth come from our newest team members. In fact, it's hard to distinguish East from
West anymore. It's quite pluralistic in its performance.
So it's hard for me to give a percentage. I think we can get better across the franchise. But there is – I just couldn't be
happier with it. And if I had to pick a percentage, I'd say well into the final quartile of performance closing. It's just
been that good. And we continue to add people there, incidentally.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: I had a follow-up question on the MSR. When you look at the MSR and the black box of
accounting that goes around it, it certainly looks like from a historical perspective, it's undervalued. I'm not sure we get
back to $150 billion level of loans serviced for others back in 2006, but it certainly looks undervalued relative to
historical perspectives. I know you have looked at it as a natural hedge or a partial hedge to production activity in a

balanced approach. But what if that black box of accounting creates a timing difference between when that asset is
written up and when the production and gain on sale starts to fall? If that occurs, would you consider more strategic
sales of MSRs rather than the non-strategic sale of the reverse mortgage portfolio you just did in order to harvest the
gain that you can't harvest from an accounting perspective?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So, Chris, let me just push back a little bit...
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: ...in that we don't consider the accounting in and around the MSRs black box accounting. We
follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles that are reviewed both internally and externally, and we think they're
very sound. I know there are some commentators that are out there that get confused by Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles and think that they're hard to follow, but they're not. Having said that, I think the fundamental
part of your question is that when we look at the MSR, it's a – to step back for a minute, when we look at the servicing
business, it's a really good business. The servicing business has been so valuable for us over the last few years. But in
particular, it has been very valuable over the last couple of years because of the fact that it's put us in position to be able
to originate as many refinance opportunities as we have been, which has just been terrific.
The capital implications of the MSR given the new Basel III capital rules makes that – creates an overlay over the asset
itself in that it could be, in certain circumstances, a potential deduct to capital levels. And that's just something that we
need to take into consideration and it's something we think a lot about. And as we've said from time to time, it may
make sense to consider selling some of the MSR. We've sold [ph] SX servicing (1:19:27) in the past. We've sold the
reverse mortgage, part of the reverse mortgage MSR this last week, which we were pleased with, so that could happen
from time to time. But it doesn't change our view that the servicing business is a very important business for the
company and is very valuable at all times, but in particular like the period we've been through.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Thanks, Tim. I wasn't suggesting that you're performing black box accounting. I just meant
the point being is that with the yield on that portfolio being as low as it is, it probably has never been lower, that the
inherent value of that asset over time is certainly going be higher than what's on the balance sheet today.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I completely agree with that.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Yes, I hope you didn't take my question the wrong way.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, I just wanted to clarify; that's all.

<Q - Brian D Foran>: Got it. And then just one follow-up on the general comments about housing improvement. And
when we look at the pick-a-pay portfolio and where it's marked and the accretion, is there any background you can give
us on the home price assumptions embedded in that, or just more generally if your view, positive view of housing
comes to fruition, would the pick-a-pay portfolio perform based on the current schedule of accretion?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think it represents some upside; I don't know. And we were very clear when we updated the
amount of non-accretable – brought non-accretable to accretable and updated the estimate of cash flows last year in the
third quarter; that if we continue to see in improvement in not only the housing market but also in terms of the
performance of the underlying asset because that's a very important part of the valuation, that we could see some
upside. That didn't happen this quarter. But given the continued improvement, it certainly could over the next few
quarters.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: In fact, as I mentioned in my comments, we have a positive view, surely in the near term
outlook, about steady gains in home sales, building activity, and price appreciation. We're seeing that in most of the
markets or, frankly, the lion's share of the markets. And when that happens, good things happen here on all things
related to real estate. It's better for our home equity portfolio, for our reverse mortgage portfolio. It's better for
production activity in the mortgage companies. So surely things are improving.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: And lastly, just if I read it right, I think there was a sale of some of the PCI loans and that I
guess pulled forward some of the accretion. With a rising market, would you expect to continue to sell some of the PCI
loans, or was just that a one-off?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: We'll look at that opportunistically. We had a $150 million gain from that. And that was – and
if we find opportunities, we surely will do what we think makes the most sense for our portfolio and for our
stockholder.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, I think just to reinforce that, we marked this portfolio four years ago, and we just could
not be more pleased with its performance. And the expectations will change over time, but if there's an opportunity to
pull through some of that, our forecasted accretion, we're going to go ahead and do that.

Your final question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey Ken.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks a lot for taking my question, good morning. I just wanted to ask a bigger picture expense
question. a couple of the pieces have been asked. But, Tim, you mentioned that expenses are still too high. We know
about the seasonality that could happen from first to second, and we know you'll make adjustments against the
mortgage business. So what I wanted to try to understand is, when you say that expenses are still too high, what can
you do to work on that underneath? How much from project comp is there still just to recognize? And then what areas
are you actually investing in, and what's the magnitude of that investment versus what you can do to control things
otherwise?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Again, I think that the focus of the company is to improve our expense efficiency. And so
when I say and we say that expenses are too high given the current level of revenue, we think that we want to continue,
we can improve our efficiency, which is why we have that range of 55% to 59%. There's no one magic change that we
can make that if we can just get through a certain project that it will get us down to 55%. It's really a function of lots of

projects all around the company. It's improving the efficiency of our corporate properties and all of our square footage.
It's improving – it's using technology to reduce costs in our businesses. And so sometimes there's some investment
related to that. It's continuing to make sure that our folks are all in the appropriate locations. And it's little things; there
are literally hundreds of projects going on right now in the company such that we're focused on reducing costs. So I'd
love to be able to give you two big items, but it's just not really the work it works now that we're done with the
integration.
But I would also reinforce that apart and separate the proactive projects that we have, the environmental costs are
continuing to come down. So that we see with an improving economy, particularly with an improving residential
mortgage business, that we could see continued improvement in our environmental costs apart and separate from
anything else we're doing internally. John, I don't know if you want to...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yes, I would add that we are making investments and we want to continue to make those
investments. And we won't be, as I said before, slavish to anything here because for example, we're doing wonderful
innovative things to help customers on things mobile and tablet-wise.
We just talked a few minutes ago about our neighborhood store. We're making investments, frankly, in compliance and
governance, all kinds of different things. On the other hand, some things just because you did it that way for 20 years
doesn't mean you need to do it for the next 20 years. And we're finding different ways to improve customer service,
customer loyalty, deepening relationships, at the same time getting rid of expenses that don't add value. Tim mentioned
a few seconds ago just space. Four years ago we had about 115 million or 116 million square feet. Now we're down to
95 million square feet or 98 million something, it's down 10% – 12%. And yet we have more people, more customers,
more products, more services. And I think that's the magic here to continue to invest. But we do all agree we can still
do more. This is a bottoms-up exercise and it's just part of doing business. There's no destination here. This is a
journey.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: And then – thanks for that color. Just the last offset adjunct to that is then just a lot of the things
you just mentioned, John, are very much about deepening relationships with customers, improving the experience. Are
there any other parts of the investment cycle that are now paying off on a clear incremental revenue side because I
think that's part of the investment part of the process that people also want to appreciate too? What are the investments
that you're making that are also you're actively seeing an improved – getting operating leverage off of?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure. For example, adding more bankers in stores and getting referrals to the mortgage
company; having ATMs that give you paperless receipts; taking paper out of stores and not having to have as many
Brinks pickups; the way people can now buy products and services on their mobile devices and other self-service
activities. It's a number of things that help reinforce this when, where, and how people want to be serviced. So there's
actually a lot of innovation going on in the industry. More happens to be within creating this distribution community,
whether it be in small business, large business, the consumer side as opposed to a different whiz-bang product. It's
much more about the overall service and availability.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Got it. And then last tiny thing, just to follow up to Brian's last question, when you mentioned
the potential for non-accretable differentials to moved back into accretable yield, is any of that potential in your outlook
for improving NII this year?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, not really because recall that in the third quarter of last year where we made the
adjustment and we moved some of the non-accretable to accretable and also increased our expectation of cash flows,
even though when you totaled it up it was over $4 billion in total , because the average life of underlying loans is 12 or
plus years, the incremental increase in terms of net interest income or net interest margin in any given quarter is
actually relatively small. It will have some impact, but it's not a primary driver for why we think net interest income
can go up in this environment.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Yes, perfect, understood. Thanks, guys.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thank you.
