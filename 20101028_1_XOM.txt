MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Today's call is
being recorded.
At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and
Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations
Good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is
ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2010. We will refer to the slides that are available
through the Investors section of our website.
Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two. Statements of
future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual results including resource recoveries, volume
growth, and project outcomes could differ materially due to factors I discuss and factors noted in our SEC filings.
Please see factors affecting future results and the Form 8-K we furnished this morning, which are available through the
Investors section of our website. Please also see the frequently used terms and the 2009 financial and operating review
on our website. This material defines key terms I will use today and shows ExxonMobil's net interest in specific
projects.
Moving to slide three, we have provided an overview of some of the external factors impacting third quarter results.
We continue to see the effects of mixed economic activity, with ongoing uncertainty in the United States and Europe

offset in part by stronger growth in the developing world, mainly in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions. The
pace of the global economic recovery and the resulting near-term supply and demand balances have been impacted by
these effects. Crude oil prices remain well above levels of a year ago. Natural gas prices and downstream margins have
also shown improvement relative to 2009. Chemical margins have improved relative to last year but have been
negatively impacted by new industry capacity coming online.
Now turning to the third quarter financial results as shown on slide four, ExxonMobil's third quarter 2010 earnings
excluding special items were $7.4 billion, an increase of 2.6 billion from the third quarter of 2009. Earnings per share
excluding special items were $1.44, up $0.46 from a year ago. The corporation distributed more than $5.2 billion to
shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, 3
billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to increase to $5
billion in the fourth quarter of 2010.
CapEx in the third quarter was $8.8 billion, up 2.3 billion from 2009, primarily due to the inclusion of XTO activity
and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. We continue to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help
meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas, and finished products.
Our cash generation remains very strong. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $12 billion, and debt was
just over $18 billion after reducing the XTO debt assumed in the acquisition by over $3 billion.
Moving to slide five, ExxonMobil's earnings excluding special items increased 2.6 billion from the third quarter of
2009, reflecting strong results across all business lines. Upstream earnings increased $1.5 billion, driven by higher
crude oil and natural gas prices and significant volume growth. The downstream saw notable improvement over the
2009 third quarter with an increase in earnings of $835 million, largely due to stronger industry refining margins.
Chemicals continued its solid performance as earnings increased $353 million on stronger margins. Corporate and
financing expenses were $506 million during the quarter, up $23 million versus the third quarter of 2009.
As shown on slide six, ExxonMobil's earnings excluding special items declined 210 million from the second quarter of
2010. Upstream earnings increased 131 million, primarily due to volume growth, while downstream earnings were
down $60 million due to lower industry margins. Chemical earnings decreased from the second quarter by 139 million
on lower commodity margins. Compared with the second quarter of 2010, corporate and financing expenses increased
by $142 million, mainly due to the impact of retiring a portion of XTO's long-term debt.
Moving next to the upstream results on slide eight, during the quarter ExxonMobil began production from the Odoptu
field, the latest development phase of the Sakhalin-1 project in far eastern Russia. This region is one of the most
challenging sub-Arctic environments in the world. The project is performing well, and current production is
approximately 50,000 barrels of oil per day. Employing world-class extended reach drilling, the project started up on
schedule and within development cost expectations. Since startup of the first phase at Chayvo in 2005, the Sakhalin-1
project has produced over 270 million barrels of oil for export to world markets.
Moving to the United States, our LNG terminal at Golden Pass on the Texas Gulf Coast recently received a
commissioning cargo. Once commissioning activities are complete, the startup of this terminal will represent the final
stage of the integrated project between ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum that includes the entire LNG supply chain,
production, liquefaction, LNG ships, and LNG receiving terminals. Our four trains in Qatar with annual capacity of 7.8
million metric tons each are all running at capacity. And our Al Khaleej Gas Phase 2 domestic gas project continues to
benefit from strong local demand. These facilities are well positioned to help meet the growing global gas demand in
Asia, Europe, and the United States.
Moving to slide nine, ExxonMobil continues to make good progress in Iraq. We have completed our six-month contract
milestones, including submission of the rehabilitation plan and the work program and budget. We have awarded
contracts for well workover operations, camp refurbishment, and offices; and recently commenced well work and tie-in
activities. We remain on our original timetable for execution and production ramp up.
Moving to slide 10, the initial development of our Kearl Oil Sands project in Canada is on schedule to commence
operations by year-end 2012, with construction now approximately 25% complete. Our original plan developed Kearl

in three phases to produce more than 300,000 barrels of oil per day. However, by leveraging recent learnings, we
reconfigured the project to include debottlenecking and expansion phases, which will increase production to the
regulatory limit of approximately 345,000 barrels per day. We expect the spending profile early in the project to be
higher as a result of revisions to comply with the changing regulatory environments and specific site conditions, with
full lease development still yielding attractive unit development costs.
We also continue to progress our global portfolio of high quality liquids projects. Slide 11 provides an update on
several of these projects. At Hibernia, the South Extension project received approval for the development plan. The
Southern Extension will be produced using the current Hibernia gravity based structure facility, but will require
additional drilling to access the resource. The plan is to drill production wells from the Hibernia platform and water
injection wells from a combination of platform and subsea drilling. Platform drilling for the Southern Extension unit is
currently planned to begin in late 2011 or early 2012.
The Hebron project is progressing and first oil is anticipated before the end of 2017. We recently awarded our front-end
engineering and design contract for the topsides, and plan to award the gravity based structure contract before the end
of the year.
In addition, we continue to progress on a number of worldwide oil drilling programs. For example, we have
recommenced drilling on our Ringhorne platform in Norway, and have an ongoing program at Beryl in the UK sector
of the North Sea. We also have ongoing programs in Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Angola, Canada, and the
United States.
Turning now to our unconventional portfolio and starting on slide 12. The ongoing integration of XTO is progressing
well, and the transfer of existing technology and experience will provide significant benefit. As an example, we are
progressing consolidation of unconventional activities to leverage XTO's experience and operational capabilities in
plays such as the Eagle Ford, Haynesville, and Marcellus.
During the quarter, ExxonMobil finalized a merger agreement with Ellora Energy. This acquisition has increased our
position in the attractive Haynesville/Bossier plays by 46,000 acres and added current production and pipeline capacity.
In addition, our gas marketing team is working with XTO to optimize shipping, processing, and marketing activities
across our United States portfolio.
We are also capturing reverse integration benefits in legacy ExxonMobil operations, both in the United States and
overseas. Recently, a team from XTO shared best practices to optimize our evaluation and development planning
activities in Canada, Indonesia, and Germany. XTO brings a rich data set, including thousands of core samples and an
extensive field testing database, which our research lab will leverage to further our proprietary shale research. We also
continue to see low attrition rates.
Overall, we are very pleased with how the XTO integration is proceeding and the potential benefits we see over the
long term.
Moving to slide 13, in Canada, the Horn River Basin is a world-class Devonian shale gas resource that is currently in
the evaluation stage. We hold over 300,000 net acres and are one of the largest net acreage holders in the basin. In the
2009 – 2010 winter drilling season, we drilled eight vertical wells and two horizontal wells. Completion and testing
operations were completed on the two horizontal wells in August of this year. Five wells are planned for the next
drilling season, which will begin in late 2010 or early 2011. Additionally, we completed the 2009 – 2010 non-operated
drilling program, and testing operations are currently underway.
Moving to slide 14, in Europe we have commenced drilling our first coal bed methane well in Germany and are
implementing a work program to evaluate the shale gas and coal bed methane potential of our acreage. In Indonesia, we
hold prospective coal bed methane acreage in the Barito basin totaling approximately 290,000 net acres. We plan to
conduct pilot tests to evaluate the viability of Indonesian coal bed methane as a gas resource and expect to initiate
exploration drilling in December of 2010 followed by pilot testing in the first half of 2011.

We have drilled our fourth exploration well in the deepwater block SC 56 in the Sulu Sea in the Philippines, and have
discovered natural gas. We have now encountered natural gas in three of the four wells drilled to date and are analyzing
data from all the wells to determine future plans.
Turning now to the upstream operating results and starting on slide 15, upstream earnings in the third quarter were $5.5
billion, up 1.5 billion from the third quarter of 2009. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $13.34. As you will
see in the 10-Q which will be filed next week, third quarter upstream earnings included a positive $150 million
contribution from XTO's operations. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations increased upstream earnings by over
$1 billion. Worldwide, crude oil realizations were up almost $8 a barrel, and natural gas realizations were up nearly
$0.70 per thousand cubic feet from the third quarter of 2009. Earnings further increased by $270 million due to higher
volume and mix effects, driven by project volumes in Qatar and the addition of XTO, partly offset by net field decline.
All other effects increased earnings by $150 million, primarily due to favorable tax items.
Moving to slide 16, oil equivalent volumes increased 21% from the third quarter of last year. Entitlement volume
effects, including price and spend impacts and PSC net interest reductions, decreased volumes by 21,000 barrels per
day, while lower OPEC quota effects increased volumes by 31,000 barrels per day. Divestments reduced volumes by
1,000 barrels a day. Excluding the impact of entitlement effects, OPEC quotas, and divestments, production was up
750,000 barrels per day or just over 20%, with the addition of XTO volumes and project ramp-ups in Qatar partly offset
by net field decline.
Liquids production increased 86,000 barrels per day or nearly 4% from the third quarter of last year as project ramp-ups
in Qatar and the addition of XTO volumes more than offset net field decline. Gas volumes increased over 4 billion
cubic feet per day or about 50% from the third quarter of 2009, driven by Qatar and XTO.
Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on slide 17, versus the second quarter of 2010, upstream
earnings increased about $130 million. Realizations increased earnings by 90 million as stronger gas realizations in
Europe and Qatar were partly offset by lower global crude oil realizations. Higher volume and mix effects increased
earnings by 160 million, driven by lower maintenance activities and project ramp-ups in Qatar and the addition of
XTO. This was partly offset by a decline in seasonally lower natural gas demand in Europe. All other items decreased
earnings by 120 million, due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.
Moving to slide 18, oil equivalent volumes increased over 11% from the second quarter of 2010. Entitlement volume
effects, including price and spend impacts and PSC net interest reductions, decreased volumes by 1,000 barrels per day,
while lower OPEC quota effects increased volumes by 4,000 barrels per day. Divestments reduced volumes by 1,000
barrels per day. Excluding the impact of entitlement effects, OPEC quotas, and divestments, production was up
455,000 barrels per day or just over 11%. Lower maintenance activities and project ramp-ups in Qatar and the addition
of XTO volumes more than offset the decline in seasonally lower demand in Europe.
Liquids production increased 96,000 barrels per day or just over 4%, and natural gas production increased over 2
billion cubic feet per day or about 22%. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and the
IR supplement.
Moving now to the downstream and starting on slide 20, in refining we continue to progress our multiyear program of
global investments targeted at increasing the supply of lower sulfur motor fuels. We recently commissioned facilities at
our Baytown, Texas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana refineries, which will increase lower sulfur diesel supply in the
United States. Our investments in hydrotreating facilities at our Antwerp, Belgium refinery are nearing completion.
And finally, construction has commenced at our Sriracha, Thailand refinery to produce lower sulfur diesel and
gasoline.
As shown on slide 21, earlier this month our lubricants business announced a multiyear sponsorship agreement with
two-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion Tony Stewart and Stewart-Haas Racing beginning in 2011. The new
agreement allows ExxonMobil to build on Mobil 1's Official Motor Oil of NASCAR designation and shows our
ongoing commitment to NASCAR. It also illustrates Mobil 1's lubricant technology leadership while supporting
continued market growth. Mobil 1's association with NASCAR demonstrates ExxonMobil's outstanding product

performance under extreme driving conditions, and showcases the engine protection and fuel economy our technology
delivers to both NASCAR drivers and race fans.
Turning now to the downstream operating results starting on slide 22, downstream earnings in the third quarter were
$1.2 billion, up $840 million from the third quarter of 2009. Higher industry refining margins partly offset by lower
marketing margins increased earnings by $300 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $150 million,
including the benefits from our refining optimization efforts. Other factors increased earnings by 390 million, mainly
due to gains on asset sales and positive foreign exchange impacts.
Moving to slide 23, sequentially third quarter downstream earnings decreased by $60 million. Lower margins
decreased earnings by 390 million, reflecting weaker industry refining and marketing margins. Volume and mix effects
increased earnings by 110 million, largely due to lower planned maintenance activity. Other factors increased earnings
by 220 million, including favorable foreign exchange effects.
Turning now to our Chemical business and starting on slide 25, during the quarter ExxonMobil continued to progress
the expansion of our integrated chemical and refining complex in Singapore. The expanded steam cracker will use
ExxonMobil's state-of-the-art proprietary technology to achieve substantial feed flexibility and increased energy
efficiency. In addition, the expanded complex will produce a range of premium products to capture demand growth in
Asia. The expansion will add over 2.5 million metric tons of capacity per year to the existing site. The anticipated
mechanical completion and startup activities will be phased in beginning later this year and will continue through 2011.
Additionally, as we highlight on slide 26, the third quarter included significant scheduled maintenance activities and
plant improvements as more than 50% of our planned 2010 turnarounds worldwide were initiated this quarter. As an
example, our facility in Kawasaki, Japan doubled its capability to produce lighter feedstocks, which will improve its
competitiveness across broader market conditions. These planned maintenance activities play a pivotal role in our
commitment to operational excellence. In addition, we continue to use these scheduled down times to incorporate
improvements that help extend our leadership in areas such as energy efficiency and feedstock flexibility.
Turning now to the chemical operating results and starting on slide 27, third quarter chemical earnings were $1.2
billion, up 350 million from the third quarter of 2009. Stronger margins improved earnings by $370 million, driven by
continued strong feedstock advantage and higher realizations. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $50
million. Volumes increased 3%, reflecting the Fujian startup as well as continued recovery from the depressed demand
levels seen in 2009. Other effects decreased earnings by a total of $70 million.
While we manage our downstream and chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture benefits from the unique
integration and optimization of these businesses. Our combined third quarter earnings were $2.4 billion, up 1.2 billion
from third quarter 2009, reflecting the competitive advantage of our integrated downstream and chemical business
model.
Moving to slide 28, sequentially third quarter chemical earnings decreased by $140 million. Lower margins decreased
earnings by 220 million, especially in Asia, with the startup of new industry capacity. Positive volume and mix effects
increased earnings by $60 million. Other effects increased earnings by $20 million.
Moving to slide 30, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings and operating performance were strong and reflect the ability
of our business model and company strengths to deliver superior results. We maintain a continuous focus on
operational excellence and improving upon our industry leading safety performance.
We continue the successful execution of our long-term investment plan, and we are moving forward on the flawless
integration of XTO's world-class organization into our existing portfolio of high quality assets. Our performance in the
quarter includes the benefit of strong project and facility uptime in all of our business segments, providing further
evidence of our disciplined and consistent approach across all of our business lines. With our unparalleled financial
strength, ExxonMobil remains well positioned to deliver on our plans.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mark Gilman with Benchmark.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: David, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: I wonder if you might be able to provide a total DD&A number for the quarter and the portion of
that that burdened the 150 million earnings contribution from XTO which you identified, and I have a follow-up.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure, Mark. We don't really disclose the details of our
individual OpEx components, so I won't be able to provide that information today.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: It was a DD&A question, not OpEx.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: I'm sorry, that was your DD&A question.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: DD&A in the quarter overall, and what portion of that burdened the 150 million earnings
number that you identified for XTO.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, if we look at the $150 million, I want to note
that that was a positive number, a positive contribution for the quarter. But again, I don't have a detailed number to give
you on the components of that, including DD&A.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: All right. Let me try my follow-up if I could. You referenced the Ellora merger. I wonder if you
could talk a bit about costs and production impact.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: In the quarter, that acquisition really had a de
minimis impact on both production and cost. If you look at just quarter on quarter given the timing, it was de minimis,
but we are looking forward to the long-term benefits of that acquisition, which as I mentioned, added about 46,000
acres to our portfolio in those plays.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: But no number for what the cost of the acquisition was?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: No, I don't have that number for you.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay, David. Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Good afternoon, David. How are you doing?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Hello, Evan. How are you today?
<Q - Evan Calio>: I'm good. I'm good. I have a question on the buyback. I know it has been described in the past as a
flywheel, but you're increasing the fourth quarter to 5 billion. Primarily given where you're trending, almost 10 billion
under your CapEx guidance on the midpoint, but your uses of cash are likely to exceed operating cash in the fourth
quarter. Are we to read anything into that? Is CapEx coming in lower or are you making more of a statement here with
your buyback?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, let me provide a little bit of clarity on both of
those items. First let's start with the buyback. There is no change. The buyback remains the flywheel of our cash flows.

And as we look ahead in the fourth quarter and look at commodity prices and the business, we have made the decision
to increase to the $5 billion level.
I would say if we take a look at CapEx and start back at the outlook we gave everyone in March, we said we would
spend about $28 billion this year. And although I don't have any firm outlook for the year, I would say if you take the
$28 billion we mentioned and add in XTO, we'd be somewhere in the $30 billion to $31 billion for the year, which
would be consistent with that outlook, and I think we're pretty much on track to meet that. We've seen some upward
pressure due to unfavorable ForEx, but over the course of the year, we'll see a lot of puts and takes. And again, I think
we're pretty much on with our CapEx target that we had mentioned before, and again if you take into account the added
activity from XTO.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Right. Right, okay; a different question, if I could.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure.
<Q - Evan Calio>: A second question on U.S. production; international volumes are really strong, yet the U.S.
volumes, both in oil and gas look a little bit lighter than we would have expected. Has the combined activity slowed
due to the gas price environment or high grading opportunities or maybe even the Gulf of Mexico decline impact? Can
you maybe help me to think about North American volumes?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. When we look at our total North American
volumes, we have seen the impact of both our ongoing operations as well as the addition of XTO. I will tell you
everything is coming on as we expected. There's been no slowdown in activity. In fact, as we've mentioned before,
activity has ramped up over the last several months, and any other offset would be just normal decline in maintenance
across our facilities, but no special effects that I can mention.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay, thank you.

We will take our next question from Doug Terreson with ISI.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: I had a question on the downstream. Specifically, asset sales and ForEx benefits were pretty
significant versus a year ago and Q2. And so I wanted to see if you could provide some segmentation and maybe
geographical color on that figure. Meaning, of the $220 million sequential delta, I couldn't tell from your comments
what was asset sales and what were ForEx and where were they.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: If you look at the downstream earnings sequentially,
in total if you look at that other bar there, the 220 that you mentioned.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Right.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: I can tell you the bulk of that is all ForEx. That's the
real factor in there.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Okay, that's fine. And also, you guys have been very successful with your exploration effort in
the Philippines. And while I realize that we're somewhat early in the play, it also seems to be becoming meaningful.
And so I just wanted to see if you can comment on market potential over there and also the next steps for development
that Exxon has in that area.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, I would tell you it's still a little early. When we
look at the size of that resource and the size of the acreage we have out there, again, as I mentioned in my prepared

We will take our next question from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Dave, you mentioned about the asset sales earlier. Can you tell us what is the actual asset sales
gain in the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Are you looking at upstream, downstream?
<Q - Paul Cheng>: I guess both; I suppose upstream is not having much of an asset sales gain, and the majority of that
is in the downstream.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. If you're looking at the sequential earnings in
the downstream, if you look at...
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Can you tell us what is the actual asset sales gain instead of just looking at say the change?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: I really don't want to get into the details of the
absolute values, Paul. But I can tell you that if we look at that quarter-on-quarter change in the other category, the 390,
the bulk of that is – about half of that is asset gains quarter on quarter.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Asset sales gain.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: And how about in the upstream?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: If you look at our upstream earnings on a
quarter-to-quarter basis, I'll tell you there's really not a big impact there. What we mainly saw there were some
favorable tax items, but nothing else in that other bar really that has to do with asset sales.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: And Dave, do we have any hedging gain or loss related to the legacy hedging position of XTO in
this quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, if we look at the hedging effects, when we look
at those, the impacts going quarter on quarter, we do have an effect of about $50 million that we booked as a gain on
those hedges as reflecting the decline in natural gas prices over the quarter.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: A final one if I could; Sakhalin-1, there has been some news coming out from Russia talking about
the possibility of a change in operatorship due to the increase in the budget, talking about your proposal is a couple of
things from the original budget. We understand there are rumors flying all around over there. Can you give us any
insight? Have you actually been in discussion with the Russian authority or whether there is any truth to some of the
numbers being cited in the press?

<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. Let me provide a little more color on the
Sakhalin-1 project. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, of course we have started up the Odoptu field. That's a
very successful project, on time, on budget, excellent performance, and really continues a string of successes as we've
developed that project going back several years.
As we look at forward and we look at the budget, I can tell you that there have been no material changes to the scope of
work for the Sakhalin-1 project. The consortium is still working within the original budget that was approved by the
ASB [Authorized State Body]. And as you would expect, we're working closely with the government and our partners
to continue the successful development of that project, and those discussions are ongoing. And everybody has the same
objective in mind, and that's to continue the success of that project and delivering the economic benefits that are
derived for all of the stakeholders.
So I wouldn't really comment on any rumors or speculation other than to say we continue to book a string of successes
in Sakhalin, and look forward to continuing producing and developing that resource.

We will take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Doug. How are you today?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Good, thanks. I wanted to circle back on a couple things. On the buybacks, Rex a couple of
weeks back, I guess a month or so ago when we all sat around a table with him, he basically made a comment that you
guys were prepared to do the XTO deal all cash. And obviously you ultimately did it all stock I think on his prompting,
if I remember it correctly. I guess my point is that if you were prepared to do it all cash, how sustainable is this new run
rate of buybacks? Is this more about trying to basically buy back the stock you issued from XTO? In other words, it's
not so much of a flywheel anymore? Can you just give some color around that in the context of the way I have just laid
this out?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure, Doug. Let me provide a little more clarity on
that. There really is no change in our approach to the buybacks relative to any other use of our cash. What you're seeing
here and you saw in our results is we have had very strong net cash generation this year. Again, the business is
performing well. You see the earnings increase. And consistent with the way we've been using our cash and
maintaining our flexibility and strong balance sheet, we find ourselves in a position to increase the buyback rate in the
fourth quarter to $5 billion. But I wouldn't – really I wouldn't try to draw any more conclusions with that or read
anything into it other than we bought back $3 billion worth in the third quarter, and we're going to buy back $5 billion
in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay, great; if I could ask a double-barreled follow-up, if I may.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: They're completely unrelated questions. The volumes, the moves around about sequentially in
Africa and Asia-Pac, can you just give some color as to what's going on there? And if I may circle back on Mark's
earlier question, are you able to give us the cash flow contribution from XTO in the quarter? And with those two, I'll
leave it there.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Let me hit the volumes first. I think you mentioned
specifically in Africa. We did see a decline in Africa on an OEB basis of about 35,000 barrels a day, and that was in

liquids. And that was really just some downtime that we had in Africa as well as normal decline. That bounces around.
If you look over at the sequential move in the third quarter versus the second quarter, you'll see our Africa liquids
volumes are up 32 kbd, strong work programs over there and business performance, so just what I would consider the
normal fluctuation quarter to quarter in what is a very large business for us.
And then could you repeat your question on cash?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Yes, actually on Asia-Pac also...
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: ...because I was under the impression that Qatar was already up full to last quarter, so if you
could give some color on cash flow from XTO, please.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. If you look at the Asia-Pac Middle East
volumes in our supplement, they are up about 139,000 on liquids and another 1.9 billion on gas. That's quarter versus
last quarter. If you look sequentially, we're up also about 60 kbd on the liquids and 819 on the gas. And so yes, that is
basically the projects ramping up and demand in country in Qatar. And we also saw some lowered scheduled
maintenance.
So I think the good news, Doug, is what I mentioned earlier. As we sit here today, all for those mega-trains are running
at full capacity, and the performance and uptime have been outstanding. And so the fluctuation that you see quarter on
quarter sequentially is really just the continued good performance and a little lower maintenance.
If we look at – I think your other question was on cash flow from XTO?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Yes, if it's possible, that would be great.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: We never really disclose details of cash flows on any
particular piece of our business or resource, and so I don't think we're in a position to offer that today.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right. I appreciate your time. Thanks, David.

We will take our next question from Robert Kessler with Simmons & Company.
<Q - Robert Kessler>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Robert.
<Q - Robert Kessler>: Congratulations on the startup at Golden Pass.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thank you.
<Q - Robert Kessler>: I wanted to know what your thoughts are with respect to the average utilization rate of that
facility for call it the next six months or so. Just looking at UK spot prices being quite a bit above the U.S. Henry Hub,
it would seem advantageous to ship most of your cargos to Europe instead of Golden Pass. But is there some other
factor to consider there maybe in the contracts or otherwise that would result in a higher utilization rate at Golden Pass
than one would assume from the spot price differential?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. Let's step back and start with the
commissioning of the LNG terminal at Golden Pass. The commissioning has begun. We've got a commissioning cargo
in there. The ship came in recently. That commissioning process is typically a two to three-month effort, and we're
focused on doing that and getting that done right and making sure all the hardware we put in the ground is working

properly. Beyond that, it's a little too early to be talking about what's going to happen after that. The important thing for
us is to get that thing up and running, and again as I mentioned, make sure that it works.
But down the road, as we've mentioned quite often, we have tremendous flexibility in our ability to place cargos out of
Qatar around the world. We will always be looking for market opportunities that allow us to generate the maximum
value based on those market conditions. And I would expect that strategy to continue going forward without being any
specific on any one country or LNG receiving terminal. We've got a great LNG business. It's very flexible. All of the
assets are up and running. This will be our third commissioning or the commissioning of our third LNG terminal,
which gets everything up and running, and we will see the full benefit and value generated from the strategy that we
will now have in place and finished up on. So we're real excited about this.
<Q - Robert Kessler>: Okay, thanks for that. And then with respect to CapEx, you mentioned the inflationary effect of
foreign exchange on capital expenditures for the quarter. Can you quantify that? And then I'm probably not going to get
too far with the second component to the question, but any thoughts on the rate of change for total CapEx next year
versus this year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, if we look at the effect on CapEx this quarter
from foreign exchange rates, it was about $400 million. And looking for I think the second part of your question, is
next year I really don't have any updated outlook for you. Obviously, we will look forward to updating that and talking
about that in the March analyst meeting.

<Q - Faisel Khan>: How are you doing?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Fine, thank you.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on your LNG spot sales. Can you
give us an idea in the quarter where most of those cargos were headed? Was it Adriatic, South America, or was it
mostly going to Asia where pricing seemed to be a little bit higher than the second quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Faisel, that's an excellent question. I don't have any of
the specific details by geography or by specific terminal. I can confirm that we are making spot sales in all of those
regions that you mentioned and certainly take advantage of market differentials and the ability to optimize and
maximize the earnings out of those shipments. But in terms of getting specific, I really don't have those for you other
than just to pick up on your comment. The ability to move cargos around to take advantage of what various markets
provide is a true strength of the business that we have in place, and we are certainly looking to maximize the value
from that.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, got it. And in the North American gas market, can you give us an idea of where your rig
count is right now in North America and where you expect it to trend by the end of the year?

essentially plus or minus, you would expect to see that in that 70 category. I don't think there will be any major changes
up or down.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay. And then last question, just on the upstream side, was there any sort of underliftings or
unscheduled maintenance or downtime across your upstream portfolio that we may have missed?

versus third quarter last year, we would have had about 50 kbd in that category.

And we will take our next question from Jacques Rousseau with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Jacques Rousseau>: Good morning. I just have a question on the balance sheet. It looked as though your debt
declined from about 20 billion to $18 billion versus last quarter. And you mentioned in your comments that you retired
– or bought back about 3 billion or so of XTO debt. So should we assume that the factor to tie this out is the increase to
short-term debt?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, we did take out about $1 billion of commercial
paper during the quarter.
<Q - Jacques Rousseau>: And is that something you see as an option to help support the buyback program?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: No, I wouldn't look at it in that regard. It's more if
you step back and just look at our overall capital structure, look at the balance sheet, look at the opportunities that the
market is offering us, it was just opportune for us to step into the CP market this quarter and take out about $1 billion at
very attractive rates, but I wouldn't read any more into that other than that. It was just our normal ongoing management
of the capital structure, and again taking advantage of what the market has on offer.
<Q - Jacques Rousseau>: Great, and one follow-up. You had mentioned before in terms of corporate costs I believe a
range of 500 million to 700 million per quarter. Any thoughts on how that may change with the XTO deal?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: No, and I would say if you look back over the last
many quarters, I know that number has jumped around a bit. But I would confirm that on an ongoing basis, you would
expect to see our corporate fee numbers to come in anywhere in that 500 to 700 range. But I don't have any other
guidance. But yes, 500 to 700 is what we would expect going forward.

<Q - Edward Westlake>: Just another way perhaps of getting at the cash flow numbers, could you just give a total
group DD&A? I know we'll get them in the Q next week, but if you just had group DD&A on the cash flow statement
and any change in working capital, that would be helpful.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. If we look at the total DD&A for the company
in the third quarter of '10, it was $3.9 billion. And that was up $1 billion from the three quarter of '09.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: And any changes in working capital?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, if we look quarter on quarter, it was about $1
billion related to a change in crude payables positive.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Okay, thanks very much on that.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: And then just moving to exploration, obviously you have a Black Sea well. I think it was
meant to complete in Q3. Where are we on that? Are we expecting results or have you got some results you could
share? It was a partner well, I think.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. Yes, that was a partner well. We did complete
that well in the third quarter. We did expense that well. However, we did see hydrocarbon shows, which did provide
evidence of a working hydrocarbon system. And we are continuing to further evaluate the data from that well, which as
you would expect will help us in our upcoming exploration program. But yes, we are finished with that well.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Okay, thank you; maybe just one final question.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: On the U.S. liquids, you have 357 in Q2, which was down a bit against Q1 because of
maintenance in the offshore Gulf of Mexico. Obviously you've bounced back a little bit, perhaps not as much as you
would have thought with XTO. Is there still some maintenance impact in the U.S. liquids?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: If you look at our U.S. liquids, we did get a nice
uplift of course on XTO, but that was partly offset by decline across the portfolio.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: So nothing unusual?

<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Hi, just a question about Greenland. I think you guys participated in one of the recent
licensing rounds. Can you give us a sense of when you might begin exploration there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: If we look at our portfolio and particularly hone in on
Greenland, you're right. We do have some acreage in the Greenland area. But I really can't give you a specific
timeframe in terms of when things – specific activities might happen. We are evaluating on an ongoing basis some
seismic work that we've done and interpreting that. But I don't have a specific date, for example, if you were looking at
wells or anything. Still early days in Greenland, a lot of acreage, a lot to analyze, and I would really say we're still in
the evaluation phase there.

on the legacy XTO properties up, down, or flattish?

<Q - Paul Sankey>: David, can I just reach around a bit more in the hedging subject? Did you say that it was a $50
million gain that you got?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Is that the realized gain, or is there – it's just that it's less than you would think it would be given
the position that we know XTO is in.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. Look, Paul, that's an excellent question. And
without trying to get too detailed into what can be some complicated accounting, as you know, we had to mark to
market all of those hedges at the acquisition. And on that basis of what the contracts were hedged at and what the strip
was at the time, as those sales have proceeded along those lines, the difference between the hedged price and the price
that we had marked that at, that would have gone into cash flow and still does.
What you did see across the quarter is that the gas price declined, and therefore it was below the price that we actually
restated those hedges at in the quarter, and that small piece does flow into earnings. So the bigger piece goes into cash
flows; it doesn't go into earnings. And the smaller piece associated with the decline in prices relative to the end June
strip did go into earnings, and that was about $50 million.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay, that makes it a lot clearer to me. And those hedge positions, I think you've stated you will
unwind. What's the status of that now?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, per the schedule you've seen publicly, we're just
going to let those unwind as time goes on.

<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: No, no change in how we're going to approach this
business.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: That's great, David. And the other one from me, I'm not sure if you will give me this, but could
you give us your capital employed on September 30 as broken down by division?

moratorium. The first thing I'd like to say is that we are pleased that the government has recognized the industry's
commitment to enhanced safety standards and response capability in lifting the moratorium. As you would expect, we
are continuing to review the details of the announcement, the changes in the rules, and standards that we'll all have to
abide by. And we're in the process of analyzing that and looking at what impacts that might have on us.
I can tell you as we look forward in the near term, you'll recall that at the time of the moratorium, we were preparing to
drill our next Hadrian well in our discovery in the Gulf of Mexico. And we are planning to submit in the near term our
revised permit application in order to get that drill underway.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Are you seeing any opportunities for incremental drilling opportunities, David?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Without being specific, certainly, and mentioning
anything individually, we are always looking at opportunities that are out there. Oftentimes there are changes in the
market and changes in the business environment that do generate opportunities for us, but I would say nothing special
or different, just doing what we always do, which is looking at what's out there, what's on offer. If we can find a way to
add value to something, we certainly look at it seriously. But that's an ongoing business for us.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Okay, terrific. And then if I could just turn to the Black Sea briefly...
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: ...I believe you contracted a rig to move into the Black Sea. Can you talk about when you might
be able to spud the first well there and what your plan for drilling in terms of timing and number of wells would be?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. I think as we've mentioned before, we do have a
new build rig that's going to be heading into the Black Sea to drill our acreage position there. As we look forward to
next year, I think you would expect to see us being able to spud that first well sometime in the first half of 2011.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: And do you think you'll keep that rig in the Black Sea for a while, David, and maybe farm out
some slots to other operators there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, we'll certainly plan to keep that rig in the Black
Sea for quite a while. I wouldn't want to talk about who is going to utilize what percentage of it. But yes, it will be in
there a while.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Great. I appreciate it, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thank you.

We will take our next question from Mark Gilman with Benchmark.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: David, as activity in Iraq West Qurna ramps up, can you help us with some guidance as to how
you will report your activity and volumes there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. Of course, it's a little early there in the project.
As I mentioned, we have met our six-month milestones. We have awarded some contracts to get the work going. But as
that ramp-up progresses, we would certainly as we head up to our production targets, we would certainly expect to
report the volumes as they're produced next year, so I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary there.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: So you'll report production prior to the time that you earn remuneration fees?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Mark, I'm not sure about the exact details in terms of
the timing. But certainly as we ramp up production and get to our initial production target per the project, we'll be
reporting production volumes.

<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Thank you, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thank you. We've got time for one more question.
Operator
Okay, and we'll take our last question from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Hi, Dave.
A – David Rosenthal>: Hi, Paul.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Two quick follow-ups. One, I presume you don't have much of an inventory gain or loss in the
quarter, do you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: No, we didn't see much of an inventory gain or loss at
all in the quarter.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Okay. And secondly on go back to Iraq, if we assume that – I just want to understand from a
timeline standpoint from the time that you will be able to actually start doing the workover activity and drilling activity
in Iraq, how long it would take before we would start to see that you would be able to get the production up to the 10%
range?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Paul, I don't have a specific timeframe to give you on
when we'll meet any specific production targets. As you know, this is a long-term effort that we have underway. I can
tell you that per our schedule and our milestones and what we were expecting, things are proceeding on track. We do
things have things underway, as I mentioned, contracts let. We would expect to reach our initial production target
sometime in 2011. But in terms of any more specific timing other than that, I really couldn't give you a more specific
date.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Dave, can you tell us whether you actually now start drilling in the field or are you still just doing
the site preparation?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: We have a number of activities that are underway in
the field, some of which I mentioned in my remarks, starting initially of course with a lot of well workovers, and then
proceeding to drilling. But as we sit here today, we're really working on the workovers and tie-ins and the major
drilling efforts are still to come.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: I see, thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thank you.
David S. Rosenthal, Vice President, Investor Relations
Okay, I want to thank everybody for their time today and the questions and appreciate the time on the call.
