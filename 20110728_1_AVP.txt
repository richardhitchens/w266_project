Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter call. Just to summarize the
quarter, as you read this morning, our constant dollar revenues were up 2%, driven by continued strength in Latin
America. Silpada contributed 1.5 points of growth.
In terms of the Beauty category, our Beauty sales grew 1% in constant dollars driven by fragrance and personal care.
Active representatives were flat, and that was impacted by China and North America. The adjusted gross margin was
down 30 basis points as continued effective price management and favorable foreign exchange were offset by
commodity cost pressures. Adjusted operating margin declined 30 basis points due to the gross margin that I just
explained. And our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.49. That's up $0.02 versus a year
ago.
The year-to-date cash flow from operations down $144 million. And the primary impact of that are higher inventory
and pension contributions that we've made in the first six months.
As I look at the second quarter, I think our results were somewhat pressured by weakening macros. We continue to
aggressively drive our 2011 operating priorities to get this business back on track. I'll talk more about that in a minute.
We have had ongoing execution improvements in both Brazil and Russia. But we have seen some slower than expected
beauty market growth.
We continue to see some weak macros in developed markets. And this quarter reflects the heaviest impact of the United
States portfolio shift away from giftables, and we are addressing that starting in September this year and we'll talk more
about that.
But if I take a look at the first six months then, in the first half our results were broadly in line with expectations. Our
previously stated expectations for the first half were that core revenue growth would be low-single digits and that
adjusted operating margin would be about flat. And again, six months to-date, the actuals are low-single digits and
exactly flat adjusted operating margin.
Moving to the second half, then, in terms of our outlook, it continues to be that we target mid-single digit revenue
growth and significant margin expansion. We'll talk a lot about that this morning. But we're going to continue to target
mid-single digit growth driven by a resumption of our active representative. And unit growth via a major field global
activation program, a stronger second half innovation pipeline, as we've always planned, and high impact
merchandising, particularly as we continue to see some of the macros tough out there in some key markets.
We project significant adjusted operating margin expansion in the second half fueled by revenue leverage, gross margin
gains as pricing and FX offset commodity costs in the second half, and continued tight overhead management. And
we're going to talk more and I'll let Chuck talk more later about our operating margin and our assumptions, but our full
year outlook remains unchanged. We continue to target 50 to 70 basis points of operating margin expansion.
Just to remind everybody about the four key pillars and the 2011 operating priorities that the team has been driving:
first, obviously, to restore growth in the all-important markets of Brazil and Russia, to stabilize our North American
business by the year-end, to re-ignite skin care, and to deliver meaningful operating margin expansion.
Specifically in the second half, the playbook in the company underpins our mid-single digit top line outlook. They are a
global field activation program that is boldly designed to re-ignite our active representative growth. They are stronger
product pipeline and innovation, particularly in color and skin care, which will drive pricing and average order. And
importantly, they're very focused on executing high impact offers to help us resume our volume growth.
Just to start with re-igniting active representative growth for a minute, our global Believe incentive is designed to do
that in the second half. This is a global sales force incentive built around the company's 125th anniversary. It targets
second half sales and active representative growth with a you do, you get payout in bonus opportunity. It was just
launched in July in all markets. And this incentive runs through the end of this year.
It is the biggest incentive in Avon's history. It is the richest in the sense that it offers three to five times greater earnings
potential for our field than previous global incentives. Importantly, it's the most balanced. It targets active
representative growth and average order growth. And some of the previous incentives have been more focused against

recruiting, but sales is an equal component here.
It is the broadest incentive, meaning that those who can participate are in sales leadership up line and top sellers in
addition to field managers who are division and district sales managers. And it's the longest incentive. We've had
incentives that last for an average of six weeks. This lasts six months during the most important time as we enter the
important holiday season. This global plan is for 2011, but very importantly plans are underway to make sure that we
anniversary this in 2012 and ensure sustainable growth.
In terms of the product pipeline in innovation in the second half to support average orders growth, we've got a new
Fergie fragrance which builds on our record 2010 launch. It was the biggest fragrance in the company's history at 90
million. So we've got a lot of exciting plans for the second Fergie fragrance as we come out of the third quarter into the
fourth.
Very important in skin care is a breakthrough skin care innovation. It's a key contributor to our fourth quarter pricing
opportunity and our average order for our representatives. This is in the ANEW brand; it is called ANEW Genics. We
have been working on this for several years. It is the first to market youth gene technology. The packaging, the formula
is really at the top of what we have developed to-date. It's much stronger than a year ago, the new launch, and it has of
course very, very attractive growth margins.
A renewed holiday gift strategy is important. We'll talk more about that specifically as it relates to the United States.
But even beyond the United States, if you look at last year's fourth quarter and holiday season, we did not have the kind
of holiday giftables in beauty or otherwise that I think our representatives needed for their earnings and gave that
consumer excitement. So we have fragrance gift sets and a separate exciting re-introduction of holiday giftables in the
United States.
If I just move to fueling unit growth in the second half, high-impact, smart value merchandising is resonant through all
of our brochures as we exit the third quarter and go into the fourth quarter and this really focuses on the under $5
products that are giving high energy, great impulse and helps us resume volume growth.
Color is an important category as well to resuming unit growth. We have two very big launches. On the left you see
Colordisiac Lipstick. This is going to be the biggest lipstick launch in Brazil this year and it launches next month. On
the right you see this is the UK but it launches throughout Europe, this company's most important mascara for the
second half, SuperSHOCK Max, both large unit drivers.
So these global programs, as well as innovation pipelines, build on the heavy lifting underway in the priority markets
that we've talked about. Let me just take you through them for a second. Let's talk about Brazil. In Brazil, we are
making progress on service improvement. The delivery delays are in line with historic norms and they have been that
way for several months now, so we feel good about that.
Our order fill rates are still below the historic average, but gradually improving. In the quarter, representative
annoyance did continue to remain a negative driver of sales, but it has improved significantly versus the last two
quarters. So the heavy lifting in the short term is driving near in-service improvements.
Importantly, though for the medium term, we are launching ERP as part as a structural service improvement. We're
actually launching it Monday. Everyone knows and we've talked about the fact that our existing IT systems are now
stable, they're stabilized but for the medium and long term they're not sustainable at the current and future volume
projections of Brazil. So the implementation of ERP will replace legacy inventory and vendor management systems in
this market with a world-class global standard solution.
Planning for this has been underway in Brazil for nearly two years. As you can imagine, we've had a very careful
assessment of the overall service and business readiness environment in this market and that confirms our comfort with
proceeding next week.
We've got significant experience and capabilities in the company over the last four years gained from prior ERP
installations. We have an amazing team down there that has been working day and night and is ready to launch this on
Monday, and again, thought project complexity is all that ERP installations too and there's that temporary risk of

disruption that might come with any kind of major system installation, but we surround-sounded this and we feel as
good as we possibly could. We think it's the absolute right thing to do. ERP in Brazil is a very major step forward to
ensure service reliability on a sustainable basis in Brazil.
Just to give you an update on where we are in field morale in Brazil, we did a survey again in June. As you know we've
been doing this frequently. We did it in January as we came out of a pretty tough period but I think the positive news
here is that in terms of the number of representatives who say they intend to stay with Avon, a true measure up there
continued loyalty, 86% of all representatives in Brazil, 88% of our top sellers.
There's been a lot of discussion about the Brazil beauty market and so as I look at it, Brazil does in our minds remains a
very key growth market in the category but the beauty industry certainly slowed in the first half of this year. A full
year-to-date beauty market growth number show that it slowed to the high-single digit rate versus I think what all of us
were expecting as we came into 2011 those low-double digits. These numbers show deceleration in both retail and
direct selling growth rate. Retail share is unchanged despite direct sales slowdown but just to remind you that retail
plays right now predominantly in the daily needs, in hair care segments which are not core direct selling categories.
If you exclude Avon, all other direct sales, the direct selling channel Exavon is also down from high-double digits to
high-single digits. The Franchise channel is one that does remain strong, albeit it's only 8% of the total beauty market.
So Brazil's still a good beauty market. We're looking for Brazil beauty market growth still almost twice the global
average, but it has slowed from the very strong pace that it had in the last several years.
Given that though, still we look at Brazil revenue for Avon and we look at revenue growth continuing to improve in the
second half. Our planning assumptions reflect current market conditions and operationally we've got very strong
second half programs in place to drive this revenue improvement. I've just talked you through the global program, but
of course Brazil being our largest market participates very strongly in them. They have major plans against the global
Belief channel – challenge. For them obviously the major color and fragrance innovations are extremely important, and
then of course, specific to Brazil we look to service to continue to recover.
Turning to Russia for a minute. In Russia, our field programs are working in a weakening macro environment. I think
importantly the strengthening field momentum is what we're seeing as our programs take hold. As you know, we rolled
out new changes to our sales leadership model at the end of January and in second quarter; we've seen a four point
swing in active representative growth taking us from negative into positive territory in the current quarter.
Unit leaders and appointments are both growing again so those are positive signs. However, we are seeing weakening
consumer macros that pressured the average order in the quarter, and certainly as we've seen others reporting in this
quarter, I think Russia's macro market is weaker than we would like to have seen it.
But we have strong programs in place to drive revenue growth in second half of the global Belief challenge is very,
very well-planned and activating to mobilize the field on top of the compensation changes we made in this market.
We've got smart value promotions and beefed up our unit movers to engage consumers as the macro environment
continues to be a little bit weaker than we thought in Russia. And here in this market, a stronger color in skincare
pipeline and execution than a year ago will be very important versus last year.
We're going to spend a few minutes talking about the U.S. I'm going to turn it over to Chuck in a minute to give you far
more detail, but let me just give you the headlines here. We are taking bold actions to address the top line in the United
States short and longer term.
In the short term, we're strategically adjusting our portfolio mix to recapture holiday giftable sales. Second quarter
would be kind of the worst quarter where you see the impact of that remix away from Easter, Mother's Day, Father's
Day, et cetera. In the medium term, we're accelerating the scale and the scope of our sales model transformation and we
want to give you more detail on that because it's important. So I'm going to turn it over to Chuck.

Thank you, Andrea. Well as Andrea said, we have initiated a bolder plan for the U.S. We spent the last several months
really reassessing the U.S. plan that we have shared with you in the past and basically we are reaffirming the basic
tenets of that plan. They do remain intact. However, we feel it's appropriate to go much more boldly and much more
broadly in terms of how we're implementing that program.
Now that we've had a chance to communicate it to our field we can take you through it. I think on the last call we
mentioned some of the elements, but we really couldn't give you too many details until we talked to the field.
First, let's talk about something that's more near in or short term and that is that we are recalibrating our approach to the
mix between beauty and non-beauty. Strategically looking at what we did, the move to more beauty was poorly timed.
If you think about it, we were expecting the mass beauty market to grow over the period of the remixing away from
non-beauty. It did not grow and in fact it declined, so we didn't have the ability to substitute beauty sales for
non-beauty.
We also really went too far and too fast taking out the non-beauty and that hurt us in terms of the energy in our
brochure as well as the field and it had a negative impact on the representatives' earnings opportunity. So we made the
strategic decision to rapidly adjust that portfolio mix and reintroduce holiday giftables starting at the end of the third
quarter.
Original targets were about 65% beauty; we now believe that was too aggressive. In the near term we're going to take
beauty down to about 55% of the portfolio and 45% would then be non-beauty. And then over the longer term, beauty
should be somewhere between 55% to 60%, a bit less than the original objectives.
And the giftables program really hits both our beauty products as shown here as well as our non-beauty products and
the non-beauty particularly in the area of seasonal items where we can have strong volumes as well as great energy
through the catalogues.
Moving from the product portfolio to the field transformation, here's where we're really going to be bolder and the
program will be much more comprehensive than we originally planned. It's a multi-year program and it's a much more
extensive sales model transformation.
Fundamentally, if you think about it, it's a restructuring of the field to grow through the leadership format and we're
basing a lot of it by incorporating learnings from the successful Mexican field transformation we went through a few
years ago where we did move into a leadership model. And just a reminder that program in Mexico was led by Jorge
Martinez Quiroga who is the same person that I have heading up the U.S. business. So we have his experience from
that very, very successful transformation.
And we also in incorporating a very extensive change management to communications plan to ensure that our
leadership reps, our independent reps and our district sales managers are totally engaged and informed every step of the
way.
So thinking about what we have today, we have a structure where we have a district sales manager. She has
responsibility for top sellers or top representatives, a significant number of unattached representatives as well as people
within the leadership format and as you think about those unattached representatives roughly half, that's right, roughly
half of our representatives are not currently covered by leadership.
So they only have a relationship to the district sales manager. What that means is each one of those district sales
managers has over 250 on average direct relationships that they have to try to administer and to support with a
significant amount of time administering to the unattached representatives.
We're going to move that to a model which allows the district sales manager to really focus and train their top sellers or
their top representatives as well as her leaders in helping them build out their down line organizations. What this means
is we're going to take all the previously unattached representatives and attach them into the leadership structure and
thereby allowing leadership to take responsibility for developing her down line and growing the independent
representatives within that down line. This allows the district sales manager to really focus on nurturing, developing,
training and helping both her top sellers and her leadership representatives to grow their business.

Same time we're doing this, we're also going to invest in and simplify our sales leadership model in a way that we feel
will really fuel the growth and the earnings opportunity. As I said, 100% of the representatives are going to be attached
to leadership. That's excluding obviously the top sellers, which will continue their current relationship with a district
sales manager.
We're going to make the qualifications to get into leadership easier, make it more attractive for representatives. Once in
leadership, we're going to facilitate faster title advancement by, again, easing some of the qualifications there.
Importantly, we're also going to align the minimum order value for representatives and for leadership. And this is
important because it encourages leadership to really work with all of their representatives as now they will earn on all
sales for those representatives where in the past on smaller sales they had no earnings opportunity because they were
below that to which they would qualify for up line commissions.
And we're going to expand the earnings opportunity to include additional things. For instance, today demo sales are not
included as commissionable sales. In the future, they will be.
In terms of what that means, it means that we should see increased earnings across all levels of leadership, most
significant on the early ranks of leadership for the unit leaders and advanced unit leaders who should see earnings
increases of about 50%.
We also want to make the business with Avon easier to conduct. So we're simplifying the fee structure to a single fee
on an invoice, a fee that is based upon the size of the order.
We're developing stronger training and development by the up line for the representatives as they will have time and
they'll have the incentive to work with their representatives to help them grow their business. This structure will also
allow the district sales manager to have more time to focus her time on the high, value-added activities, less time
administering those unattached reps who are now attached to leadership, more time training and developing leaders,
and nurturing also the relationships with her top sellers.
We launched a pilot in the mid-Atlantic to see if our premises would hold true, and the early results are promising. In
terms of order frequency, number of orders from the first generation, it's up about 11%. And recruiting by leadership,
and this is important if you go to a leadership model, recruiting by leadership is also up during this time period. So
orders are up, and recruiting is up.
We also had polled our district sales managers to see what their feelings are, just a couple of the questions here. One is,
"Do you think that sales performance levels will be higher after completion of this program?" Sixty percent of the
district sales mangers felt that this will deliver stronger sales growth, and another 22% were kind of neutral on the
question, which means only a small percentage, about 14% disagreed.
The second area would be in terms of, hey, can you manage your way through this transition as a DSM? Can you
deliver your KPIs? And here, 70% of the district sales managers agree and almost 20% were neutral, which means
roughly 10 to 12% disagreed in terms of the difficulty of managing their way through the transition. So again, a strong
confirmation of DSM behavior during transition.
All but just a couple of quotes and you can read them later, but just pulling off a couple of highlights here, this is
"Avon is giving us a new lease on life, everyone's excited about the program, it's motivating to my team, I love the
changes, look forward to a great fourth quarter." And I think that's a specific reference to the return to get the bold and
particularly in the non-beauty category.
So remember this is a bold program, it's a multi-year process for implementation. We feel that from the field point of
view, the full implementation, the transformation, will be complete by the end of next year 2012. However, the
portfolio changes I described should start to benefit us in the fourth quarter of this year.
So that's it in terms of what we're doing with the transformation of the U.S. business from the field and product
category side. Now just a couple of slides in terms of the total company's outlook.

In terms of the second half, we do expect to see significant adjusted operating margin expansion. It should be up
significantly due to higher revenue growths with continued tight controls over our overhead expenses.
Our gross margin should also expand. And this is going to come from pricing, both strategic and inflationary to help
offset the commodity cost pressures we are experiencing. We see the last half of the year one of favorable product mix,
as well as some country mix in terms of where the growth is. And then manufacturing productivity continues to be a
key element in terms of containing costs, both through our strategic sourcing initiatives and cost reduction programs.
Another big area of improvement is lower dual distribution costs in Latin America. Here's where we have been phasing
out of old distribution centers in Colombia and Brazil in particularly and into the new facilities. That has hurt us by
about 40 basis points throughout the year. And those dual distribution costs will decline as we go into the end of the
year and will be fully behind us by the end of the first quarter of next year. So in terms of that margin expansion, we
expect to see it in both quarters, third quarter and fourth quarter, however more of it in the fourth than the third.
In terms of what that means for the total year, our total year outlook remains in line with our overall goals. We continue
to target 50 to 70 basis points of margin expansion for the full year. Sure, there're always assumptions, some of the key
ones would be that the revenue growth accelerates as we expect it to over the last half of the year; that the
macroeconomic headwinds, which are around the globe, do not worsen; that commodities do not worsen, things like oil
prices, which in fact are transportation costs, or silver; Beauty category does not slow further in our key markets; and
that Venezuela remains relatively stable as a country.
Before leaving, I guess I'd like to just mention one other item and that's inventory and inventory management.
Inventory has been disappointing. It is a key priority. We did make some progress against the high year-end 2010 level.
But it really isn't enough, and we're stepping up our aggression against this to reduce the inventory levels as we move
throughout the rest of the year. The good news I think is the existing inventory in the high levels, it's all saleable and
we don't see an obsolescence problem. So we're focusing our marketing and brochure efforts on those saleable products
and increasing the flow of them throughout the second half. In addition, the second half sales growth improvement or
increase will also help to reduce the inventory from a planning point of view.
And finally, the second half should benefit from the strengthened sales and operational planning process that we have
in place and one that really is a fundamental focus for the process excellence initiative whereby how we operate, how
we communicate, how we simplify processes and how we take responsibility for inventory management is a key
feature.
Andrea Jung
Thanks, Chuck. Just a closing thought then and we'll turn it over to Q&A. It's a very, very important second half for the
company. We understand that. All of our focus is on accelerating the top line. We are taking the necessary aggressive
actions to restore sustainable growth for the short and long term. A lot of heavy lifting has been going on in this
company in the first six months of this year to get this business back on track.
I feel we're making solid progress although not yet reflected in our revenues, but the foundational changes are in place
and the bold plans are also in place for the balance of the year. So we feel that we are on track to achieve our 2011
goals. So with that let's just open it up, Operator, for Q&A.

<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: You reiterated your back half guidance, but I guess Q2 top line and margin results both
came in below the guidance you gave on the call last quarter. So can you just run through some detail in terms of what
was worse than you expected in Q2 and why it would bounce back in the back half of the year to allow you to still
obtain those second half goals?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah. I think that from a top line point of view, the one you contributed with deceleration in
North America, and I think we've kind of taken you through what the plans are for the second half which should be I
think distinctly different from the first half and the fourth quarter as it relates particularly to average order. I think the
second quarter in the United States was probably the worst quarter we would see in terms of average quarter pressure
from the remix and the takeout of the giftables particularly on holidays like Easter, Mother's Day, et cetera.
So that clearly pressured the quarter, I think, between some of the positives that we're seeing in the resumption of
non-beauty to a very thoughtful level in the fourth quarter. Those are the kind of things that would make second half
different than the first half towards second quarter in particular in the U.S. And on the bottom line as it relates to
margin, its gross margin is expected to improve as strategic pricing, inflationary pricing and the impact of foreign
exchange in the case of the second half versus the second quarter would offset and be stronger than the commodity
pressure.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And then on the U.S., it continues to struggle quarter after quarter here and you
guys have had multiple efforts at revitalizing it and now you've got the further changes you mentioned. Instead of
investing and implementing a lot of time and money here behind the business, do you think at some point you might
need to rethink your level of commitment or focus in the U.S. and just get more aggressive at starting to milk the
business for cash flow or shifting advertising and RVP spending to other higher growth regions?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Let me take that in terms of the U.S. opportunity and I think the things that we're putting in
place with the field transformation, correcting the mismatch, I guess, in terms of the changes, and the product mix, to
me, will portray a stronger, more healthy business that does have sustainable growth opportunity, particularly if we get
the field transformation piece right. I still think that business has the ability to grow at or somewhat slightly ahead of
the Beauty category over the longer term.
I think it's a business that when we get those fundamentals right and have a low double-digit operating margin which
it's a relatively healthy margin. It will be less than the total company, and so we're fully committed to seeing this
transformation through. I believe the excitement that I've seen from the field, the excitement I've seen from my
management team who has done it, and they've been through it before in a relatively similar situation in Mexico with
Jorge's leadership. I am optimistic that this is the right thing to do for the business at this point in time.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And it sounds like the mix changes from a product portfolio perspective should
help right away. How long do you think the field transformation will take in order to take hold and drive improving
results?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Well as we said, it's really a multi-year program. And the transformation and the
restructuring of it goes through the end of next year. So it's 2013 that you would first start to see some results. But even
then, there's a learning curve involved there. It's a 2013, 2014 metric.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz. Please say your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Yeah. It's Deutsche Bank. Can we just stay with the North American business for a second? I
mean do you think that the overhead is right there given some of the growth attributes? Because if my math is right, it
seems like the U.S. is 40% of assets, 21% of sales, and then 13% of profit. So is it really a growth problem or an
overhead problem?

<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Well no, you hit one important point there. And that is that overhead structure and the scale
that we have right now. You can't incrementally cut costs when you see revenues drop $100 million to $200 million
each year. So to make this business sustainable, yes, we have to have the top line growth. But we also have to have the
scale and size right of our overhead structure.
And we have laid out in October of '09 I think it was, a plan to cut the overhead structure by about $100 million or total
cost structure by about that. If $75 million of that has been achieved, the other $25 million comes with some final
supply chain initiatives, factory closure being one of the big ones. I believe that we will have to have some further scale
cuts to get the balance right. So that is on the agenda in terms of the overall program for the U.S., making sure that we
have the right structure for the size of the business going forward.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. Thanks. And then...
<A - Andrea Jung>: Bill, that is right and that is what we will continue to do, but to me, it's a growth problem and a
growth solution.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. And just to follow up on that, is there a right number where the structural overhead
becomes a positive versus a negative in terms of organic growth and this is broadly for the company? So is there an
organic growth number where you're going to positively lever fixed cost as opposed to negatively lever them in terms
of margin?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: No. And by the way, I believe that when you see the beauty market return to sort of
normal, long-term growth rates, which are still in the low to mid-single digit range, I think that's the level at which you
would be able to see favorable leverage versus unfavorable.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: So at 3% growth you can get favorable leverage?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: I don't know whether it's 3% or 4%, but in that range. So obviously you've got to think
about wage inflation versus price inflation, but if you hold all those constant, those are the kinds of numbers I think.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. Then one quick last one. How big was the Silpada write-down in the quarter?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: There was no write-down.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: I thought you did an impairment test and it came in like 13% below or something.
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: No. We did an impairment test that showed that at this point in time, we're very close to
one component of goodwill valuation, but on the earnings side we have a lot of headroom, so there was no write-down.
So we cleared the impairment test this time.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.

<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, from Citigroup. Just going back to the U.S. stuff, my first question is the near-term
impact of the transition on margins. If we assume Silpada's now anniversaried, I think the U.S. is running at a 3% EBIT
margin. Do you think with this transition and the cost of communication and all that, those margins go down further
before they go up?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: I'm not looking for any material margin improvement in the very near term.

<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Okay. And then in terms of just the strategy and attaching all of those unattached reps to
the leadership program, is there a risk that, I don't know, 20% of the reps say, "I don't want to be part of leadership. I
want to be an entrepreneur, so I'm going to go to work for Tupperware or somebody else?"
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: I guess there's always that risk, but most of the other direct-selling models have virtually
all of their representatives into some kind of a leadership position.
<A - Andrea Jung>: It doesn't mean, Wendy, that they have to be part of the leadership opportunity and definitively
have their own down line, it just would mean that in the case, unless you are a top seller, you would be under the
lineage of a leadership representative in terms of your direct line as opposed to directly into a district manager, even if
you're just a seller.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: But it does mean that those leadership reps who then have those people put underneath
them are all of a sudden generating more revenue because they're getting, whether they interact with that person or not
or train them or take them to lunch, they're still getting a piece or a slice of that whatever commission that they
generate?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: They get an incremental piece, yeah.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Yeah. Got it. Okay. And then my second question just switching gears to Latin America,
the 1% unit growth, I would think that at some point with really low level of unit growth there, there ends up being like
negative operating leverage and the Latin American volumes would be at risk so why would I be wrong in assuming
that and then just Mexico specifically, it looks like it's carrying the day kind of in Latin America, what was unit growth
specifically in Mexico? Thank you.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Okay, just first on Mexico, unit growth was 13%? Okay. So yeah.
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Yes, 13%...
<A - Andrea Jung>: Honestly, Mexico continues to produce strong results so reps were up strongly, units were up also
strongly. Venezuela was a big driver of the difference between first quarter and second quarter Latin America units,
Venezuela kind of coming from 40%, down to 15% in total revenues.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Okay, and then the impact potentially if units...
<A - Andrea Jung>: No. Units were down in Venezuela, significantly in Venezuela.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Okay.
<A - Andrea Jung>: But I think if you look at the second half of the year, total company in Latin America would be
included in this as we accelerate the business to mid-single digits. I think it's sort of half units, half net per units, so I
think we do have some volume assumptions of a resumption to volume growth for the company inclusive of Latin
America acceleration.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Okay, terrific. Thank you.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Okay.

<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: It's Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Guys, I guess I just wanted to talk a little bit about
your thought process behind the holiday giftables in the U.S. stuff. I guess the strategy has changed a couple of times
over the years and now you're going back toward giftables and that's fine.

I guess I just want to understand is that because you really liked the add of that business because again it's not supply
chain-friendly and there's not a lot of differentiation, but you've realized you just can't do it and it's not feasible to do
that sort of thing over time or are you doing it because you really see more of an opportunity? I guess I'm trying to
understand if it's a defensive maneuver and it kind of strikes me that just as you get past the anniversary of the toughest
holidays and the U.S. hits its worst quarter, now you're kind of reversing track and going back to these and we've heard
from you so many times in the past that these things aren't really good for the long-term health of the business. So I
guess if you could talk a little bit about your rationale behind it and is it a defensive maneuver, that there's something
that you just can't get away from so you have to go back to it?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: You go ahead.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, I mean Chris, I would say that I think that the strategy for the company, now to come back
to the United States, if we had our clean sheet of paper would not be to have a mix as low in beauty as a percent to sales
as we do and that would not be reflective of the total company average or any kind of new markets that we're moving
into.
Having said that, I think a strategic thought – and we were trying to go to 80% beauty but it's to make a significant
move to beauty was strategically right for the long term but the pace of it and the degree of it and understanding its
impact on actually store energy and current top-selling representatives and their earnings was too much, too fast. And I
think the other thing, as Chuck said, is we're staring down and made the assumptions that there would be a 2%, 3%
mass beauty growth rate in the U.S. certainly as we kind of looked at this in 2009 and we knew that we were going to
have this recession moment, but certainly as we looked out to '11, '12, that the beauty market would kind of go back to
its historic levels in the United States at least in mass.
And you know, it's been unexpectedly depressed for longer than we thought. So we kind of have the headwind of a
category that's not exactly robust, but it's certainly at mass, and the movement out and the halo impact of that on total
rep earnings as well as those representatives who are placing less beauty because there isn't some of the non-beauty,
certainly right now I think is exacerbating the direct sales energy for the existing representatives.
So I feel like it's the right thing to do to calibrate this thoughtfully but strategically back to a level that still gets, as
Chuck said in the long term, to a little bit less than we were talking about – 60%. But it was too fast in this environment
and this beauty market economy with our current top sellers, it's too important a category for them and I think we drove
energy out of the whole book by not having it at the holiday giftable time.
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Yeah. The only thing I would add to that is I think when you think about giftables, it's a
very selective offering of giftables and it's seasonal in its nature. What it is not is – I'm going to call it leveraging the
channel or stuffing the channel, which is a catalog with anything we can put in there to try to generate a sale. So the
business has a very specific purpose in its nature. We're not going to go deep into odd categories like some of the
household stuff that we were in, in the past. We really are focused in our approach.
<A - Andrea Jung>: I think the point is giftables in terms of using the consumption dollar that you would buy and
spend for somebody else. I think what we're not trying to do is really enhance and bring back own self-purchased for
your home. But if you're going to spend money at Christmas and you're going to spend it on somebody else the Avon
store has to have enough of that opportunity, beauty and other, so that we garner that share of holiday spending for
others in one disposable income.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Got it. Thanks. And then I guess, Chuck, why is it so hard to get inventory down? I mean
is it hard to locate where the excess inventory is in the system? Is it a system issue, understanding sales haven't been
probably quite to where you expected them to be, but why is that so difficult?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: I think it's a process issue, not a disability issue or system, I mean we know what the
inventories are. They're fairly obvious. But it really is making sure that our sales and operational planning process is
operating effectively, that we have the right communication between supply chain and the commercial organization,
that we have the right level of responsibility and here, one of the process changes we have made is general manager is
now responsible for the inventories. Where in the past it was kind of – well it kind of belonged to supply chain and

you'd end up with some mismatching in the forecast process. So as I look at it going forward, it's really enhancing the
operating processes across the company, tightening the relationship, one step again between supply chain and
commercial, giving that ultimate responsibility to the commercial head, that's the general manager, these are the things
I think will help us to improve over time.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: I mean is it as simple as they're not talking to each other? I mean you have one – you
have a top line forecast and the operational guys don't want to slow their plant down, I mean or they just don't get that
message?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: I don't want to say they're not talking to each other but I think there's an element of how
realistic of a forecast when you do, do a forecast you want to cushion it a little, how do you get the balance right and
what we have to do is just work with facts going forward.
<A - Andrea Jung>: One of the things that we established that I think I spoke about on the last call and so we
established it at the end of April is a real focus on four processes in improving every aspect of the process and the sales
and operation planning process, which really includes and completely enhances integration from a planning supply
process, who talks to whom. Not that they're not talking but exactly when timing, et cetera, is part of a company-wide
focus and so again, I think you can see that reflected in a few months after the inventory levels in Q2, but all of the
work and the additional people and process we put in on this and the company should help us accelerate a very
aggressive need to work through this inventory and then add some inventory improvement at year-end.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Thanks, guys.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Emily Klingbeil. Please state your affiliation then pose your
question.
<Q - Emily E. Klingbeil>: Hi, Credit Suisse. My first question – let's say both of them relate to Brazil. Our sense is
that your main competitor in Brazil had a very strong performance in April and May, followed by a very weak
performance in June. I was hoping you could talk to me a little bit about the sequencing of what you saw happen during
the second quarter.
<A - Andrea Jung>: No. In our case, I mean I think our dynamic continues to be the primary, I think, driver of Avon
Brazil's depressed rates has been the service environment that we experienced coming out of the back half of last year.
And so when I look at the second quarter, again second quarter was 4% versus the first quarter at 2% and when I look
at it across the quarter, we're just seeing this gradual improvement though not to the levels that they were historically
for sure but it is an improvement versus first quarter.
<Q - Emily E. Klingbeil>: Okay. So month-over-month, it kept getting better for you?
<A - Andrea Jung>: There was not a major falloff compared to the first half of the quarter, if that's what you're asking,
not very long, not at our estimates.
<Q - Emily E. Klingbeil>: Okay. Great. And then my second question was, how are you reacting competitively
towards new launch of the color cosmetics line called Una? We understand that they're doing very well. I'm just curious
in terms of if it's had any impact on your cosmetic side of the business.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, cosmetics is a very important category for Brazil. We have huge color share in the market
and a very, very, big plan for the second half of the year. I think I showed a very important lipstick launch, which is not
just about the lipstick, but it's an entire field engagement around the Color category which over the last few years has
been very, very strong. So we have a lot of competition in a lot of categories in Brazil, in Color in addition. But we feel
very good about our Avon Color brand and we've got a lot of innovation against that in the second half of this year.
<Q - Emily E. Klingbeil>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation then pose your questions.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi. I'm from Bernstein. So I don't mean to be the professional naysayer about Avon, but you did
only grow 50 basis points organically. Free cash flow is disappointing again, and you can't even cover your dividends --
free cash flow probably because everything was negative. North America's down 15% with margins still eroding after
years of a turnaround.
And the response we hear almost echoes of the past. So innovation's going to be the way we're going to drive it. We
have aggressive inventory management, we've heard that for years. North America, your new plan kind of sounds like
your old plan with the word bold mentioned a couple of times. And plus a more costly pyramid structure in the U.S.
So I kind of want to go back to a question I asked a few quarters ago before you really felt the pain that you've felt so
far. I guess I struggle with understanding what gives you confidence that there actually is even an inflection point here
and that you're not just dealing with a structurally disadvantaged company?
<A - Andrea Jung>: We have, I think, the absolute right full plan to reinvigorate the company's active rep growth in
the second half. When we look at all the levers that the challenge for the global sales force pulls, starting in July, we
believe that this will resume active rep growth; it will be a major driver of the acceleration to mid-single digit growth in
the quarter -- the half, I should say. And so the largest component of it is the resumption and the re-ignition of active
rep growth, and that is a company-wide plan in every single market.
And on top of that I think that – and we had talked about it in the fourth quarter of last year that we had some execution
issues in the back half, whether it was depression of normal revenue rates in Brazil because of a service challenge. So
we talked about what those were, and we said that the company was focused intensely, which we have been, on
improving that execution, making sure the pipeline is strong, and making sure we have the right balance for average
orders. So those are the things we're doing, that is the play that we're running. And you've heard what our stated targets
are for the second half.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. And let me just expand if I could on one part of the question, which is just around strategy.
And I guess I'd love to hear if you think you do have a robust strategy. And I say that in the context of a little bit of a
longer timeframe. So not just North America going from non-beauty to beauty and back to non-beauty; not just in the
past going from lower priced products to try to trade people up, which sounded like a good idea with Ultimate Elixir, et
cetera, and then now going back to smart value.
But also ZOG NOG and we never really hear about ZOG NOG again. China with our key strength for growth, and now
it's kind of tucked into Asia-Pacific. Spend on advertising was going to be increased because analytics suggests that
spend on advertising is going to work. I don't think we even heard analytics this time around. But this time we're
actually – forget about the advertising spend, we're putting a lot more into RVP. So it just feels like a
guardrail-to-guardrail strategy. And again, perhaps I'm mistaken but I just – I don't – do you feel you have a robust
strategy?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, I guess I disagree with you. I think that the strategy has been consistent and that we have
not veered off-strategy. The beauty of Avon's portfolio is that we have price points in all tiers. We are a store, not just
one brand to fill one niche and that we have the ability to have smart value products. We look at over $10 products, $5
to $10 products, under $5 products. And depending on the economy and depending on MAC growth, et cetera, that is
how we flow the products.
So I don't think that you have a strategy to be solely and smart value and then we're going to flip over next year and be
in high price. We have all of that. We need to have all of that at the kind of revenue size we are. It's a direct selling
company. There's no larger beauty direct seller company in the world. And we can't just be in one price tier. So I don't
think that's a flip-flop of strategy, whatsoever.

And our stated strategies on geography longer term, whether it be China, whether it's India, those stay in track. Our
advertising is up significantly from when we restructured this business. We made a stated remix in 2011 that we said
and told you about that we were going to remix our advertising into RVP for 2011, particularly because in some
instances, whether it's China's sales transformations or anybody else who's got to get service right or field fundamentals
right, first we understand that advertising is efficient and effective and paying back. And we have more advertising than
most direct sellers in the world by a long shot, and that stays part of our strategy. And we continue to look at
advertising and RVP growing in line with sales as we go forward because they've been an important part of how we
restructured this business in this value change since 2005. So I respect your point of view, but I disagree with it.

Your next question comes from Nik Modi. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yeah, UBS. So just a quick question on skin care, if you can just give us a run down there. I know
there was a re-launch of Avon Solutions in the second quarter; you have the Avon Care launch in the first quarter. I just
want to get your perspectives on that category given it's importance to gross margins.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, skin care was still pressured somewhat in the quarter. It was flat if you would exclude
China, which I think it's about the geography as opposed to the category. In that case, we do look forward to growth in
skin care in the second half.
Solutions restage was launched in Europe in the very back half of the second quarter, and it successfully reversed
double-digit declines in those markets that launched it: Turkey, U.K., Russia. It is launching in Latin America in 2012,
as well as North America. And we've got major, I think, strength versus a year ago in ANEW, particularly in the fourth
quarter.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Stifel, Nicolaus, and good morning. I wanted to go back to Ali's question and just follow
up a bit on that. I keep hearing about the size of the business in terms of that as a strategic opportunity for Avon, but as
being the biggest direct selling company in the world and necessarily the best and part of what I mean is you take a
look at some of your direct selling peers, at least the public ones and they've had pretty substantial amounts of growth
in recent years and even more operating margin expansion.
So I guess when do you get to a point where you potentially reevaluate whether you need to be the size that you are,
including if you get to the end of 2012 when you talk about implementing some of the changes in North America, if
they're not working, is that maybe a time to reassess what's going on there? And then somewhat related to that, beauty
direct selling category trends are definitely favorable worldwide but Avon at least in the near term here has
underperformed. So thinking about longer term expectations, is at least mid-single digit sales growth still the right way
to think about this business?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well when you said that I say that the size of our business is a strategic opportunity, I don't think
I phrased it exactly that way. I mean our size is our size. I think because of the strength over 125 years of the brand, I
think it is complex at this size because we have to have for consumers, knowing the number of representatives we have
and the number of consumers we have, different tiers of price points to offer them in the stores. So that is what I was
talking about in terms of size of business. So again of course, growth levels are going to be different on a $1 billion

company than a $10 billion company, that's true in any sector.
Retail is going to be the same thing as direct sales and so certainly we attribute the size of our business to an
enormously sustainable brand and a channel that is obviously strong in terms of numbers of representatives with a lot
of changes that we have made on it which are different. I mean we didn't grow up a multi-level company from day one
so putting through the changes to evolve to our sales leadership framework as well as the continued evolution of it in
certain countries. It's more complex but I think the absolute right thing to do because I think sustaining a single
level-only company in a business, which we clearly have seen over the last few years, can continue to grow with
another horizon of growth with a multi-level opportunity is what we're evolving to. But we didn't sort of start up this
company as a small seed direct sales company that way.
So those are the complexities, but I think the opportunities that we face in the size of the business that we're at. I mean
again, your question about the United States business; I think we just explained to you the play we are running. We
believe that this will resume again stabilization and then growth in the future in the U.S. If that doesn't work and we
believe it will, I mean that's a different story but this really has to do with sort of trying to see if we think the portfolio
in total should be smaller in terms of running it to be independent.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: And in terms of the long term sales growth algorithm?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: I think that's an appropriate way for us to think about the business. Remember that's how
we planned the business, that's how we cost to the business. It's built upon expansive geographies where you have
different growth rates. It's based upon really beauty category growth rate. It's projected against all those geographies;
the strength of our geographic footprint does allow us to take advantage of strong growth markets. Latin America is a
great example of that. So I think in terms of thinking about costing against the businesses, it's the right perspective to be
in mid-single digits.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Alice Longley. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: Good morning. Hi. I'm Alice Longley, Buckingham. I have a couple of questions really
about guidance. You said that operating margins adjusted, I guess, should be up in the second half. Will they be up if
we look just at the regions alone? And the reason I ask, of course, is that operating margins for the regions alone in the
second quarter were down a whole lot more than the operating margins overall because of the big cuts at corporate. So
I'm trying to understand if the second half improvement will come off from corporate or whether operating margins
from the regions alone might be up as well?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Certainly the improvement that we're expecting in the second half of the year has to come
from the markets as opposed to an expansion of what you saw at global. And then I think what you're referring to is the
allocation system that we have. There are two parts to it. One is what are the gross corporate expenses and then those
expenses are actually – that's an area that we've really focused on in containing and controlling them. And so the gross
expenses are down a bit in the quarter. So that would be the gross number if you look at the appendix charts we set out.
And then the allocation is based upon a formula, if you want to call it that that complies with SEC allocation rules that
you set up at the beginning of the year based upon certain parameters that you're coming out of the prior year. And yes,
based on those initial assumptions, some of the allocations did increase so we had a corporate benefit that had a double
impact. One, it's allocating a bit out, but most importantly, is that the overall gross costs were favorable. But the only
way we're going to get improved margin is to have improved margin regionally.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: Okay. And then my other question to do with guidance is on inventories. Can you give us
a sense of your expectations for when inventories start increasing year over year less than sales?

<A - Charles W. Cramb>: I would like to think as we've looked at this year and the plans we've put in place for the
last half of the year, I'm hopeful we'll have a slight improvement in our coverage, our days coverage, which is the way
you have to look at it, because currency kind of makes those comparisons difficult. And then we're still expecting three
to four to five days year improvement going forward based upon the plans and the processes that we're putting in place.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: Do we get improvement in the third quarter?

Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning. BMO Capital.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Hi, Connie.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Hi. Could you talk a little bit about the believed incentive because as I'm looking at it,
it's going to last quite a bit longer, six months versus your normal six weeks and you say that it offers three to five
times the earnings potential? How do you know that the growth you might get out of this incentive program this year
isn't next year's tough comp? How do you plan to pull it into next year so that doesn't happen?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah. I think I mentioned that we're really planning this not just for one year but really looking at
how we plan the global incentives for 2012 so that this doesn't become next year's comp problem. We don't want to
have that issue, so that we don't have to be discussing this next year. So the team when they started this understood that
they're working really kind of on a multiple-year front in terms of how to really pace and make most efficient and most
powerful the field incentive in the company. So we've taken a lot of its funded by what potentially been regional or
local incentive monies against different incentives and I think the power of putting it behind this and having kind of one
uniform competition and one uniform, very, very exciting set of goals and payouts. I think it's going to give it its power
but we are planning to anniversary this next year.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: But that does that mean that this incentive program continues at the same level
through the first half or maybe through 2012 to establish activity?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well I think you end up with – I mean obviously part of it is just sales. Its sales driven. Their
goals are on sales as well as active reps and obviously looking to drive at very important staff count which is an
important momentum to the business as you close the year and that should drive you through the first half and coming
into the first half of next year against this first half of 2011 should be an opportunity if we have the right staff count
driven by this as we go through the year.

Then when we look at the second half on the incentive itself, that would probably be when we anniversary the second
half incentive. So I wouldn't see the global incentive being for the first half of '12. I would see that based – the growth
there being based on the staff that we bring in during this important quarter from this challenge now.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay. And then just a separate question if I may. I know that you can't really comment
then the FCPA investigations, but we haven't heard about ZOG and NOG and I – in the Q, it says that you're beefing up
compliance and oversights internally. So how much cost, ongoing cost is associated? I guess it would all be booked in
SG&A with compliance and oversight as you tighten up whatever programs you had in place.
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Yeah, and it's not an easy number to say because part of it is what we're doing from an
oversight perspective which is squarely under the offices of the legal department as they develop the training programs,
that they put in a much stronger structure to address really compliance over the long term. And then you have what
happens locally, market-by-market to make sure that we do have a robust internal control process. But we've – in
thinking about it; we felt that hey, the number's probably $7 million to $10 million and $0.01 to $0.015 a share of
incremental cost if we just isolate the cost piece.
<A - Andrea Jung>: In SG&A, yeah.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: And that's an annual number?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Yes. Because it will be an ongoing – it's an ongoing process.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Per Ostlund. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Per E. Ostlund>: Thanks. Good morning. It's Jefferies & Company. Wanted to ask a little bit about the shift from
advertising to the RVP side with the sales leadership and incentives. Can you talk to any market specifics there? Are
you kind of over-indexing the incentives in sales leadership in certain regions and if so, is it because they're currently
underperforming and you're trying to reaccelerate them or is it better performing markets that maybe you're trying to
keep the momentum in? Thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung>: I'll take the latter of your thought. I mean the sales leadership investments; you've got particular
costs in Mexico and South Africa. I think we would both agree that those are good investments and they are – certainly
sales leadership has been a big driver of the Mexican revenues and Mexican rep growth as it has been in South Africa.
So you're going to see higher RVP costs, specifically sales leadership costs in markets like that wherein the early days,
sales leadership is really driving revenues. The advertising remix part of it, I mean it's even a suspension in China. That
was half of the advertising decline in the quarter and I think that was strategically the correct thing to do until we go
through the transition. So those are decisions that are done market by market and it would be different in a different
year.
<Q - Per E. Ostlund>: Sure. Maybe just to quickly follow on the point with China's advertising having pulled back, I
think the mindset there makes sense. Can you kind of update us on the line of sight to stabilization there? Obviously,
we've got a handful of quarters of fairly steep declines and I think that that was largely expected. But has your outlook
in terms of timing on when the transition really takes hold, has that changed at all or gotten pushed out?
<A - Andrea Jung>: I think we still feel that 2012 should be the year that China grows and shows profit. We have
talked about breakeven in 2011, and it looks like we're tracking to that. And obviously we knew that the revenues
would continue to be pressured. We're still hoping and looking for that revenue decline to stem and lessen as we come
out of this year but that 2012 should be the year where we begin to grow and show profit.
<Q - Per E. Ostlund>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante MBA>: Weeden & Company. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Hi, Javier.
<Q - Javier Escalante MBA>: Andrea, a quick question – actually it's more philosophical I guess, is your sales
basically are running flat, up 0.5%. There are steep declines in the U.S. You have increased competition in Brazil.
What gives you confidence that the current level of strategic spending is adequate? If I see the increases in RVP versus
a decline in advertising, your strategic spending was up only $7 million. So you are basically saying that second half
margins are going to accelerate or they're going to expand based on accelerated sales. But how that is going to happen
if you are not spending enough in a tougher macroeconomic and competitive environment? And I have a clarification
on the U.S. later on if you could.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Okay, Javier. Hi. I just – I think you have to look at this as more than one year. We have been
significantly increasing the investments in both advertising and RVP particularly in our key markets ahead of or way
ahead of growth. Obviously, that was a margin decision we made since 2005 and we think it was the absolute right
thing to do for the medium to long term. So we were growing those two investments significantly ahead of sales in
some of our markets just for this – for the reason of making sure that we were structurally a different competitive
investment story. We are broadly comfortable with the overall company's level of investment.
When you look at advertising and RVP, it is significantly more than it was in 2009. In 2010, we did beef it up again. So
I think that the level, the absolute level of investments when you look at advertising and RVP, we're comfortable with
it. We think it allows us to compete in the second half effectively in enough flexibility to invest in the priority markets
that are important where the spending is driving and if I look out, I'm comfortable with the level of investment growing
now in line with sales growth because we stepped it up so much over the last several years.
<Q - Javier Escalante MBA>: And in the U.S., I don't see that you have disclosed this for a while but given that you
are making this big change in the field structure, it would be helpful for us to know how much of the current reps are
basically consumer reps that have chosen not to be in leadership? And number two, whether they propose a structure in
any way is similar to Mexico or it has been or it is different to the one that has been put in place in Mexico?
<A - Andrea Jung>: It will be fairly similar. I mean, not exactly the same but I think it'll be structurally more parallel
to Mexico. And I think that the strong results on a sustained basis in Mexico didn't happen overnight. And Mexico, just
to go back, it took a couple of years to get this thing right in Mexico, but then there's been sustained – we were looking
at rep declines in Mexico and now we're growing in the teens in terms of reps for multiple quarters and a sustained
period. So that's been the change that, again, it's not overnight but that would be the parallel example.
<Q - Javier Escalante MBA>: But these reps that are in the U.S., because leadership in the U.S. has been for such a
long time, and if you can help us understand, those who have opted, I would say, intentionally not to be part of
leadership, what percentage of the reps are in that category? And it's kind of like trying to understand to being direct
selling such a fragile ecosystem the fact of shifting them into a leadership rep to what extent this is now going to create
disruption in the field. I'm just trying to understand that.
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: We don't have hard metrics on who is or who isn't a customer rep. Two things I guess, the
first is that what we did was we had a system where we had district managers doing a lot of recruiting. That by its very
nature resulted in a lot of reps that they brought in staying, being mentored by the district managers, as opposed to
moving in to a lineage structure.
I think the second part of this is, in terms of numbers, I think what you're really getting at is there a risk that we're going
to have a significant reduction in the number of representatives as we go through this transition. The customer rep is a
person who orders, has a very low order value to begin with. So from a value point of view, I don't think it's a material
risk.

Also in terms – it's interesting in terms of the pilot -- and its early days on the pilot -- but in terms of the pilot looking
for gross negatives, as we've gone through the first, I think, it's seven, six, seven campaigns of it, what we have found is
the number of orders hasn't changed any. Now, we haven't got a full alignment and a full transition over for all these
reps. But to me there's nothing right now that would indicate a significant value risk to the business for this transition
because of the customer rep grouping.
<Q - Javier Escalante MBA>: But if you don't know the number, could you at least tell us what percentage of the
sales, U.S. sales, are generated by this however small sector? What percentage of the sales do they generate, the
consumer rep?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Well, because it's hard to define what a consumer rep is. The number I will give you is that
2% to 3% of our sales come in at around that very, very low minimum order value, and that's probably the best
barometer you have.
<Q - Javier Escalante MBA>: Okay, thank you.

Your last question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Linda Bolton Weiser>: Hi, Caris & Company. Can you -- sorry if you'd talked more about Mexico and I missed
it -- but can you talk about whether the strong growth we saw there, both in units and in local currency sales growth, is
sustainable at this mid-teens level or was there something that artificial -- not artificially -- but in a one-time way
boosted the growth exceptionally in the quarter so that we may see lower growth going forward? Is there any color you
can give on that?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, let me just, without going forward, let me just take you back. Q3 2010, 14% growth; Q4
2010, 14% growth; Q1 2011, 16% growth; Q2 2011, 18% growth. So I think that we would call that pretty consistent.
<Q - Linda Bolton Weiser>: Okay. And then can you – on the leadership transition in the U.S., is this going to result
in higher payouts for leadership bonuses, and does that -- that comes out of corporate SG&A -- is that going to impact
your cost structure at all or is it relatively immaterial?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Certainly, there'll be enriched earnings for leadership. And yes, that will come out of, or it
shows up in our SG&A expenses. But in this whole restructuring, we think that will be funded by reduced cost for the
district sales manager fees, which is also in SG&A. So it's a self-funding program.
<Q - Linda Bolton Weiser>: Okay. And then just finally => in Central and Eastern Europe, I guess you said Russia
was down 2% and the whole region was down 3%. So some other countries were worse than Russia. Can you just give
a little color on some of the other areas and if there's anything that was bad?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah. I mean one market that has been tough and hopefully will have a better second half is the
Ukraine. Ukraine has had very, very tough macros, and they were also highly impacted by the social tax changes in that
market. And so Ukraine was significantly negative in the quarter. And as I said, the macros are tougher than I would
like to see particularly in Eastern Europe. And I think all of us are surprised at just people reported results in Russia. I
am pleased though that the field programs in what we control seems to be working quite nicely, so that hopefully bodes
well for the second half.
<Q - Linda Bolton Weiser>: Okay. Thank you.
Andrea Jung
Okay. Thank you. So I think that is it for questions. If you have any follow-up, Amy will take the calls. And I
appreciate everybody's time this morning. Thanks a lot. Take care.
