MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call.
At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and
instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek. Please go ahead, sir.
John Griek
Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's fourth quarter 2016 earnings
conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Steve
Shebik, and me, we will have a question-and-answer session.
Also here are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin,
President of Allstate Financial; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. In December, we announced that John
Dugenske will be joining Allstate as Chief Investment Officer in early 2017. John will join the team next month and
will be part of our quarterly earnings calls beginning next quarter.
Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, and posted the
results presentation we will discuss this morning. These documents are available on our website at
allstateinvestors.com. We plan to file our 2016 Form 10-K later this month.
As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations.
Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2015, the slides, and our
most recent news release for information on potential risks.

Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and
our investor supplement. We are recording this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And I'll be
available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.
And now I'll turn it over to Tom.
Thomas Joseph Wilson
Good morning. Thank you for investing your time to keep up on our progress at Allstate. So, let's start on slide two. We
delivered excellent results for the year and finished 2016 with another strong quarter as we continue to effectively
execute our short-term plans and build on long-term strategies. As a result, Allstate's well-positioned for continued
success.
Auto profit improvement plans over the last two years have enabled us to begin focusing on growth in 2017 while
being able to react to further auto loss cost increases. The Homeowners business continues to generate attractive returns
despite higher catastrophe losses. Investment results for the year were good, but bounced around from
quarter-to-quarter reflecting volatile external conditions. At the same time, we're investing in growth both with existing
businesses and new opportunities.
Net income was $811 million for the quarter and $1.76 billion for the year. Operating income was $2.17 per share for
the fourth quarter and $4.87 per share for the year. The recorded quarter combined ratio for the year was a touch over
96, and underlying combined ratio was at the favorable end of the range we provided to shareholders a year ago.
Shareholders received $1.8 billion in cash through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We also
welcomed SquareTrade into the fold providing shareholders another opportunity for profitable growth.
Going to the box at the bottom, total revenues of $9.3 billion for the fourth quarter reflected 2.8% increase in
property-liability insurance premiums driven by the continued implementation of our auto profit improvement plan and
higher performance-based investment income.
Net income for the fourth quarter was $811 million and operating income was $807 million. Operating income
benefited from favorable underlying loss performance in both Auto and Homeowners insurance, lower catastrophe
losses, favorable prior-year reserve releases, and strong investment income.
The Property-Liability insurance business performed well as a result of successful execution of that auto profit
improvement plan across the three underwritten brands and continued excellent performance in the Allstate Brand
Homeowners and Other Personal Lines insurance. Allstate Financial had a strong quarter with $130 million of
operating income as the Annuity businesses benefited from the very high investment income from the
performance-based portfolio.
Moving over to the full-year columns at the right, the 12 months operating return on equity was 10.4%. And that's
down slightly from the prior year largely reflecting higher catastrophe losses in 2016. Consolidated policies in force
declined modestly over the year as strong growth at Allstate Benefits was more than offset by a decrease in the
Property-Liability business.
Looking forward to 2017 on slide three, we are in a position to achieve an improved underlying combined ratio and
achieve our five operating priorities both of which have both short-term goals and long-term objectives. We expect to
build on last year's insurance margin improvement resulting in an annual underlying combined ratio of between 87 and
89 in 2017. That range is comprised of a number of key assumptions.
First, there will be continued improvement in Auto insurance profitability as increases in average premiums and filed
rates gives us flexibility to deal with increases in the frequency and severity of auto accidents. Secondly, we assume the
Homeowners underlying combined ratio would deteriorate slightly from 2016, but will still be well within our target
range of profitability. Encompass and Esurance are assumed to stay on track to improve Auto profitability. At the same
time, we'll continue to invest in growth across the company.

Our priorities for 2017 remain largely consistent with 2016. The first three priorities, better serve our customers,
achieve target economic returns on capital, and grow the customer base are intertwined and ensure the corporation has
multiple paths to profitable long-term growth.
In 2017, we expect to grow our customer base through continued policy growth in Allstate Benefits and Esurance, rapid
growth in our newly-acquired consumer product protection plan business, SquareTrade, and by reducing the number of
policy losses under the Allstate and Encompass brand.
As you know, we proactively manage the $82 billion investment portfolio to achieve the best risk adjusted return over
time. Net investment income is relatively stable with the large fixed income portfolio and then additional income comes
from the performance-based investment. The total return on the portfolio will be largely dependent on U.S. interest
rates and economic growth.
Our fifth priority continues to focus on building long-term growth platforms. The Allstate agency platform is being
strengthened by rolling out the trusted advisor initiatives. Esurance will continue to expand in Auto and Homeowners
insurance. Allstate Benefits will continue to leverage position in the high growth Voluntary Benefits market. Arity will
go about the Telematics business, and SquareTrade will continue to gain new retail partners.
Let's go to slide four to cover Property-Liability results. Net written premium grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter and
average premium increases were partially offset by 2.8% decline in policies in force. Fourth quarter catastrophe losses
of $303 million were 15.4% lower than the prior-year quarter.
Catastrophe losses for the year, however, were nearly $2.6 billion, which was $853 million higher than 2015. The
reported combined ratio for Property-Liability was 89.9 in the fourth quarter of 2016. When we exclude catastrophe
and prior reserve re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio for the fourth quarter is 87.7 bringing the full year to
87.9.
The four customer segments for the Property-Liability market is shown on a diagram at the bottom of the page. As you
know, Allstate is the only company that provide a differentiated value proposition to each of these customer segment.
The Allstate Brand, which is in the lower left comprises 90% of premiums written, serves customers who prefer a
branded product and value local relationships. Underlying margin improvement throughout the year in the Allstate
Brand was driven by the progress made in the Auto insurance business. Homeowners insurance and Other Personal
Lines continue to have strong profitability.
The Esurance in the lower right serves customers who prefer a branded product but they're comfortable handling their
own insurance base. The underlying combined ratio for Auto insurance improved for the year, but is above our
long-term target with the fourth quarter being somewhat elevated.
The Homeowners business is growing rapidly, the loss ratio is within expectation, but the underlying profitability was
negatively impacted by start-up advertising costs. Encompass, in the upper right, competes for customers who want
local advice, are less concerned about brand experience and are served by independent agencies. We remain focused on
improving returns in executing our profit improvement plan in this brand.
Answer Financial in the upper right serves brand-neutral self-served customers and is an aggregator that does not
underwrite the insurance risk. We'll cover the results of these three underwritten brands in more detail on the
subsequent slides.
Now, let me turn it over to John.
John Griek
Let's go to slide five to cover the results for Allstate Brand Auto. The recorded combined ratio for the fourth quarter
was 95.3, which was 3.3 points below the prior-year quarter and benefited from the prior-year reserved re-estimates.

The quarterly underlying loss ratios and combined ratios are shown on the chart on the top left. The underlying
combined ratio of 96.1 in the fourth quarter 2016 improved by 1.5 points compared to the fourth quarter 2015, driven
by a 2.8 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. This brought our full year underlying combined ratio to 96.4,
nearly a full point between year-end 2015 results.
The chart on the top right shows the drivers of the improvement in our underlying combined ratio. Annualized average
premium increased to $978 or 7.1% while underlying loss and expenses increased by 5.5%. This resulted in a favorable
gap of $38 comparable to the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, loss trends benefited from favorable current accident
year reserve development worth 0.7 points.
To provide additional insight into our loss trends by coverage, the bottom half of the page shows the paid severity and
frequency trends for both property damage and bodily injury. Property damage paid frequency, shown by the blue bar,
continued to show an improving trend. After experiencing elevated levels in the second half of 2014 through the first
quarter of 2016, results in the second and third quarter of 2016 were essentially flat, and the fourth quarter experienced
a decline of 1.2%. Property damage paid severity increased by a modest 1.9% in the quarter and the rate of increase has
come down throughout 2016. Bodily injury paid frequency decreased 19.2% in the fourth quarter while paid severity
increased by 18.8%. These results are consistent with the trends experienced in the third quarter.
Frequency and severity should be looked at in combination to get a sense of the true underlying loss trend. As we
discussed in the third quarter call, bodily injury trends reflect payment mix and claim closure patterns that were
impacted by changes in claims processes in the second half of 2016. These changes involved requiring enhanced
documentation of injuries and related medical treatment, and resulted in a reduction in the mix of smaller dollar claims
paid. The increase in severity of larger dollar claims are more consistent with medical inflation. And we continue to be
comfortable with our bodily injury incurred severity trends.
Slide six provides detail on premium and policy growth for Allstate Brand Auto. The chart on the top left highlights our
premium trend. Average premium as shown by the blue bar increased 7% compared to the prior-year quarter, a slight
deceleration compared to the upward trend beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium
shown by the grey line was up 6.8% and continued to increase reflecting the lag between written and earned premium
recognition. Since the end of 2014, auto average premium has increased by over 11% in total.
We have continued to get approval for higher auto prices where appropriate as part of our comprehensive auto profit
improvement plan. In the fourth quarter, approved rate increases totaled 1.3% for the Allstate Brand bringing the full
year approved rate increases to 7.2%. While our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan has improved margin, it's
also reduced growth as we anticipated.
New business applications shown on the top right were down 21.9% for the full year, however, were flat to the
prior-year quarter. Additionally, auto retention, shown on the bottom left, was down 0.8 points in the quarter and for
the year. The combination of these two factors resulted in a decline of 2.9% in auto policies in 2016; however, both
trends have stabilized in the quarter.
Slide seven highlights the continued strength of Allstate Brand Homeowners. The top part of the page provides detail
on our profitability results showing that we have continued to generate attractive returns with a recorded combined
ratio of 68.7 in the fourth quarter, benefiting from lower catastrophe losses despite Hurricane Matthew and the
Tennessee fires. For the full year, the recorded combined ratio was 83.7, generating in excess of $1 billion in
underwriting income.
The underlying combined ratio of 59.1 for the quarter and 59.5 for the year continues to reflect strong, underlying
profitability. While our underlying combined ratio results for the year have been excellent, our long-term target for this
line remains in the low 60s. The bottom half of the page provides detail on our growth trend, which follow the auto
lines since many of the customers in this segment prefer to bundle their purchases. New business and retention levels
declined leading to a 1.2% decline in policies in force.
Slide eight provides a holistic view of our Esurance results. We continue to remain focused on improving auto
profitability while investing in product and geographic expansion. The recorded combined ratio of 105 in the fourth

quarter was 2 points below the prior-year quarter. And for the year, the Esurance combined ratio was 107.5 lower than
the prior-year period by 2.8 points driven by lower expenses.
The lower expense ratio for the year reflects reduced advertising expense. The underlying loss ratio of 76.3 is higher
than our long-term target primarily due to higher auto claim frequency and severity, and we will continue to take
actions to enhance Esurance returns. Esurance growth trends are highlighted on the bottom of the page. Net written
premiums continue to grow on increased rate actions while policies in force were slightly higher than the prior
year-end.
Slide nine highlights results for Encompass. Encompass remains focused on improving returns which continues to
adversely impact policy growth trends. The recorded and underlying combined ratios of 90 and 90.7 in the fourth
quarter were better than the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, the underlying combined ratio is 90.3, a 2.3 point
improvement compared to prior year. Policies in force declined by 13.4% from the same quarter a year ago reflecting
both continued lower new business and retention. The majority of decline in policies in force was in six states.
And now I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, John. Turning to slide 10, Allstate Financial premium and contract charges totaled $574 million in the fourth
quarter of 2016, an increase of 4.9% when compared to the prior-year quarter. For the year, premiums and contract
charges increased 5.4% as Allstate Benefits surpassed $1 billion in premium with an increase of 442,000 policies.
Allstate Financial's operating income of $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $32 million higher than the
fourth quarter of 2015. Net and operating income trends by business are shown on the charts at the bottom of the page.
Allstate Life net income was $58 million and operating income was $56 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Operating income was consistent with the prior-year quarter at higher premiums and improved mortality were offset by
lower net investment income. Allstate Benefits net income was $22 million and operating income was $23 million in
2016's fourth quarter.
Operating income was flat to the prior-year quarter as higher premiums from policy growth were offset by higher
benefits, DAC amortization and technology-related expenses. We expect to make additional investments in technology
as this business grows. The $33 million increase in operating income in Allstate's Annuity business compared to the
fourth quarter of 2015 is a result of higher returns on performance-based investments.
The chart on the top right highlights the growth in carrying value and annualized yield for Allstate Financial's
performance-based investments, which primarily back the immediate Annuity business. Net investment income of $101
million on these investments in the fourth quarter was very strong and was almost $30 million higher than the average
of the preceding seven quarters. So we anticipate continued variability given the timing of investment origination and
disposition and market condition.
Let's go on to slide 11 in our investment results. The chart at the upper left shows the shift we made in the risk profile,
over $81.8 billion investment portfolio. The portfolio remains largely in corporate fixed income securities. To support
long dated liabilities, we are replacing market risk with idiosyncratic risk with emphasis on ownership over lending.
The conservatively-positioned high-yield portfolio is being used in part as a bridge to fund performance-based
strategies we will reduce as this portfolio increases. Performance-based investments now comprise $6 billion or 7% of
the portfolio. These assets require higher economic and regulatory capital, but we expect them to deliver attractive,
long-term economic returns to our shareholders.
In the upper right, total return for the quarter was a negative 0.7% reflecting a decline in fixed income investment
values due to the post-election increase in interest rates. The full year return was a strong 4.4%. As you can see in the
chart, solid investment income from both our market-based and performance-based portfolios has delivered a consistent
contribution to return of approximately 1% each quarter.

Net investment income and invested yield by business segment are shown in the bottom two charts. Property liability
investment income reflects an interest-bearing yield closer to market yields and the portfolio's relatively short duration.
Allstate Financial's investment income and yields reflects its portfolio's longer duration based upon its liability
structure, the impact of last year's immediate annuity portfolio repositioning.
Performance-based investment results are the primary source of variability income and yields between quarters as you
can see in the numbers above the chart in the bottom left. Performance-based investment returns in the fourth quarter
were above our long-term target as we had strong results in the quarter, which included income realization on direct
real estate investments and substantial appreciation on a few funds.
Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital position and highlights our financial flexibility. Shareholders'
equity of $20.6 billion at year-end increased $550 million over year-end 2015. The debt-to-capital ratio of 23.6%
reflects the issuance of $1.25 billion in senior unsecured debt in December to help fund the acquisition of SquareTrade,
which closed January 3. We held $2.4 billion in deployable holding company assets at year-end, which excludes the
funds utilized for the SquareTrade acquisition.
Book value per share of $50.77 increased by 7.2% over year-end 2015 primarily due to net income and increased
unrealized gain in the investment portfolio, partially offset by capital returned to shareholders. We returned $1.8 billion
in cash to common shareholders in 2016 through a combination of $486 million in shareholder dividends and the
repurchase of over 5% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. At December 31, 2016, there was $691
million remaining on the $1.5 billion repurchase authorization.
Now, I'll ask Jonathan to open up the line for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your
question, please?
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: Hi. Yes. Good morning. My first question, what drove the favorable development within
your Auto book in the quarter? And did that come from some of the most recent accident years?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Steve, do you want to take that answer?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So, Elyse, what we – so it's Steve – the results that we look at, as you know, from our
reserving processes is we do a quarterly review, bottoms up. We have the reserving department reports to me separate
from our business units. We look, as you indicated, year-by-year, we look at virtually every state, so we have a very
specific program methodology both mathematically and qualitatively as we walk through the results. We look at by line
of business. We look at a tremendous amount of detail. So, the actual results that you're seeing are based on across
multiple lines and across multiple of prior years. You'll see in the 10-K we filed, we have some additional information
that will give you a little more details of the specific years. But clearly, it is not just 2015 or 2014, it goes back three or
four years, which is the nature of our business, and the length of the tail of our bodily injury-type coverage is in
addition to the shorter tails that you might see that we generally would report earlier in the year.
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: Okay. But some of it did relayed, I guess, to the more recent accident years and we were
seeing some of the higher-frequency trends like 2014 and 2015.
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: The frequency shows up immediately, right, because we do it based on counts. Some people
do target-loss ratios. That's not the way we do most of our reserving. We do it for some lines of business, but what
happens is of course, some people say we think we are going to get a 70 loss ratio, so they take 1,000 premium and
they book 700 of loss. That is not the way we do it in our business because of the short-tail nature of it. So it is – what
you see is what you get. There is also a little bit of movement between quarters. So as we – which doesn't show up in

the triangles in the 10-K, but we adjust as we go throughout the year to reflect what we're seeing in the specific year.
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: Okay. Thank you. And then as I think – you know, as we see the frequency trends got a lot
better again in the fourth quarter and you guys reported a pretty good improvement within your auto margin. And now
on the commentary, some of your commentary points that you're looking kind of to pursue growth. Can you just
provide, you know, some more color? I mean, is this – are you looking in certain states I guess that are showing better
trends than other or is this broad based? How do you think about both – you know, new business, which I did see
flattened out in the quarter? New business growth from here as well as pursuing growth and higher retentions across
your over-all auto book of business?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I'll make one overall perspective, and then Matt will give you some specifics. I would
not interpret this quarter as – that was then and this is now, that we're going back to where we were. Miles driven were
still up this quarter. People continue to drive more than they have in the past. Accidents tend to be more frequent
whether that's distracted driving [indiscernible] (26:14) I would not want you to take away from the fourth quarter that
we're headed back to where we were.
Matt can talk about where we are in pricing, and we're up almost $100 per policy in Auto insurance premiums which is
quite substantial, which gives us more flexibility to pursue the growth you're talking about. Matt can talk about that.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Good morning, Elyse. It's Matt. Let me follow on to Tom's comments. First, I think about
this in three different components. First, the rate environment. The way I would describe it is that we have completed
some of the work necessary to kind of catch up to that spike in auto frequency that we saw over the last 18 months.
And so you saw a fairly dramatic increase in rate taken in order to catch up quickly and try to get back to appropriate
margins. And we believe, with some exceptions in a few states, but in the vast majority of places, we have now caught
up, and now we're in the mode of keeping up with emerging trends. So we don't know what this year will bring or next
year, but we are now positioned very well in order to be able to react quickly, and to keep up with trends as they
emerge.
Having caught up, it gives us a little freedom to do some things that we were unable to do over the last couple of years.
And one of which is to begin adding agencies again, and points of presence is extremely important for us to enable
growth. And that points of presence not only of agencies but the licensed sales professionals, and financial specialists
that go along with them. It's hard to do when you're focused intentionally on taking rate and dealing with the disruption
that causes. But now that we are in a slightly more stable environment, we're able to focus on that strategic deployment
once again.
The second thing that we're hoping to do is to stem the retention losses and declines that we've had. Growth, over-all
growth and items in force, as you know, is a combination of new business growth and retention. And it's a vicious
treadmill if retention keeps declining because it's very hard to add enough new business to make up for that loss. We
saw a slight stabilization in the decline in this last quarter that makes sense to us since we took a huge amount of rate in
the second quarter of 2016. And so most of that has burned through already and impacted customers who we've dealt
with the disruption already. To the extent we're able to keep more moderate rate increases, at this point on, we believe
customer disruption will be mitigated, we'll be able to hold on to more customers.
And on the new business side, the third component is the competitive environment. And while we took a fair amount of
criticism or questioning for reacting quickly about 18 months ago, I think that has been to our benefit. I think most, if
not all of our competitors, have talked and recognized some increased frequency, and in many cases, are reacting only
recently from a rate-taking perspective. That type of rate taking from our competitors create shopping behavior in their
customers. And to the extent we're better positioned, we have increased agency capacity and our agents are ready,
willing and able to serve those customers. We should be in a very good position to pick up more of those customers
from a new business perspective. So it's really a combination of all those items of improving retention, being in a
position to capture more new business, and hopefully, in a more stable rate environment, disrupting fewer customers.
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then one last quick question. You did...

<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: You know what, Elyse, let's go to the next question because we get like about 12
people in line here, okay? We'll come back to you if we have time.
Operator
Certainly. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question,
please?
<Q - Greg Peters>: Thank you for the call and taking my questions. I'll keep it to two questions, I guess.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Thank you.
<Q - Greg Peters>: Just as a follow up, Matt, you were talking about agencies and points of presence. I was wondering
if you could provide some demographics around your agencies. How many are close to retirement. And should we infer
from your comments that you're as – because you took pricing actions earlier than many of your peers that your product
and price position should improve throughout 2017? And then I'll have one follow up to that.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Okay. Greg. Well, let me try – I don't have the actual agency demographics in front of me
and I don't want to go based upon memory. But I can tell you that we have over the last several years engaged in a
different type of recruiting and selection process for our agency owners, both in terms of geographics and in terms of
demographics.
I think, as you know, we have a historical presence on the Coast and that has served us well and we've been able to
grow well there. We have not done as well in terms of strategic deployment in some of the heartland states, in the
lower-premium states, and we have a concentrated effort to do that.
In terms of the people that we're bringing on, I would say that we've done an, what I consider, an excellent job of using
data and analytics, and some of the predictive tools available to us to better select people who will thrive in our new
environment. And you know, we've talked a little bit about our shift to a trusted advisor mode, but the type of agency
owner and licensed sales professional that would have thrived maybe 10 or 15 years ago will not be the same type of
person that we're looking to now to thrive in the next 10 to 15 years.
The trusted advisor model is much more relationship than advisory-oriented. It's much more technology-driven. It
requires people who really want to get out there and use data and analytics and technology themselves to serve
customers to be able to really advise them about the risks that they take on in their lives and how to mitigate those risks.
It requires somebody who is more sophisticated about money management so that they help our customers manage
their cash flows as well as manage their risks.
So, the type of agency owner we're bringing on and licensed sales professional we're bringing on, I feel very confident
is one designed for the future. And you know, we had a decline in most of 2016. We saw a pick up in the last quarter of
about 200 licensed sales professionals, and that is really key for us. And when you look at our agencies, we will be
shifting – we have a – we've always had a focus on increasing the number of agencies because we believe physical
points of presence are important. But agency capacity is just as important.
And so, the number of licensed sales professionals and their specialization, their ability to sell life and retirement,
commercial insurance, all of the different consumer household lines, homeowners. Their ability to specialize, segment
and licensed sales professionals so that they can really focus on serving customers is going to be key. And so, I think
from a demographic perspective, we are certainly creating the type of a field force that's better able to serve customers
in the future.
<Q - Greg Peters>: Excellent color. Thank you. I just – I guess one – the follow-up question to all that I just go back
to the product positioning for 2017 in light of your comments about – your early actions on price versus some of your
peers. Obviously, the focus will be going forward for Wall Street and some of your investors will be PIP growth and
improvement in retention. So just a clean-up on that. Thank you so much for your answers.

<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure, Greg. Well, first, I'm going to ask you to resist the natural tendency to think that
growth is only a factor of price. Certainly rate and price competitiveness is a component, but it's certainly not all of it.
Some of the things I just talked about the trusted advisor and better serving our customers, and better claims process, a
more focused advisory system, the ability to do in force reviews and annual reviews on their holdings, that is all a piece
of retention, and that is all a part of growth.
But you are correct. Shopping behavior is typically triggered by price changes. And to the extent, our competitors are
now taking additional rate in fairly significant chunks because they are catching up as we were, about 12 to 18 months
ago. That will trigger – it's likely to trigger shopping behavior on their customers. And if we have already gone through
that and are stable, I believe we will be better-positioned to potentially add some of those customers and begin serving
them as Allstate customers.
<Q - Greg Peters>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Your question, please?
<Q - Randy Binner>: Thank you. I just want to follow up on the response to Elyse's questions on reserves. And so I
guess the way I heard it was that the favorable PYD was primarily from auto BI over the last three to four years. What
do you think caused that? Is it a change in your claims approach that you mentioned earlier? Is there – you know, is
there some other aspect that caused that favorable development? Because it was notable, and it's not really the pattern
we've seen from others.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Well, I can't speak to what it means with respect to others. It's as you described, it's
mostly auto. It's really not a big percentage, by the way, of total reserves and loss cost. When you look there, there's
normal variation in making estimates when you're looking out to anywhere from two to four years to get claims
resolved, particularly in BI, which tend to stretch out three to four years. There is nothing unusual about it. We had
reserve releases much greater than that over time. And so I don't think you should read anything into it other than we
conservatively estimate what we think our loss costs are. And to the extent, we wind those years up, not as much cash
went out as we estimated would go out, then it shows up in the P&L.
<Q - Randy Binner>: And then the other question is – I appreciate all the commentary about Allstate being closer to
loss trend with all the initiatives you've done over the last couple years, and that's clear in the numbers. What's your
sense of what's actually happening out there from kind of accident frequency perspective? Meaning how – are accidents
still worse? Are we still seeing distracted driving impact, the frequency of accidents? And then I'll leave it there and I
have one quick follow-up.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Hello, Randy. It's Matt. I'll try to answer that. There's loads of data out there about the
correlation between miles driven and additional accident frequency. But there's also data out there about increased
deaths from increased fatalities because the seriousness of the crashes is greater. And we have talked about – and I
think we're seeing mounting evidence of the increased influence of distracted driving on that combination.
And the issue is this, we – people refer constantly to the fact that there have been cellphones for many years and so
actually cellphone use hasn't spiked up that dramatically. But in fact, smartphone ownership and use has spiked up
dramatically. And when we look at smartphone ownership statistics and smartphone use, and compare that to accident
frequency, the correlation is striking.
And so when you have increased miles driven due to increased economic driving, lower gas prices, so increased leisure
driving, you have increased number of drivers on the road. That means lower margin for error because you used to have
maybe 10 cars packed into a space and now you have 15. And so even if there was distraction before – you had greater
reaction time before. Now, with increased density, you don't have as greater space to react in and so we're seeing
increased accidents. We saw a spike in that and that is what we've reacted to.

So when we say – and I think the comment Tom made a few minutes ago is really important when he said, there's a
difference between saying things have stabilized and saying things will revert to where they were before. We don't
think accident frequency is reverting back to where it was in 2012 or 2013 or 2014. What we're saying is the spike is
over and it has now stabilized at a new norm. And we think, at least our belief is and our assumptions for all of our
future work is, that we are at that new norm in heightened accident frequency due to the greater economic activity,
greater density of cars on the road, and the greater use of smartphones and distracted driving in the car.
<Q - Randy Binner>: And so then if that's a new plateau, is the kind of penetration of these cases by the trial bar also
at a new high that we should expect to continue?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: I'm sorry. Could you say that again?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Yeah true. It's a trial bar question.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Oh, a trial bar. So that's a, I think, more of a severity question than a frequency question.
Yeah, you've heard some of our competitors talk about the combination of medical inflation and the trial bar influence
on severity cost. I think, to some extent, we've seen many of those same things. But I'd like to think we have been doing
work on claims management and claims handling for the last several years as we saw those trends emerging. And that
led to some of the work that we talked about that influenced the BI frequency and the BI severity trends that you see
that we reported on last quarter. I'll remind you that we did have a process change and we talked about that last quarter.
We encouraged you then and I will encourage you now to look at BI frequency and severity in combination, because
the decline in frequency has led to the increase in severity.
We started really high and I'll remind you that our number one commitment is always to pay customers and claimants
what we properly owe them. That being said, there are claims management techniques to ferret out and eliminate fraud
and wastage that don't compromise on that promise, and that's what we've done. We began reacquiring some enhanced
documentation of injuries and related medical treatment to ensure we were paying properly, and that did change the
mix of claims paid.
In 2015, about a third of the BI claims paid were below $1,000. In 2016, that has dropped to about a quarter, leaving us
with fewer, but higher severity claims. So that's what you see, a changed payment mix. It's still in line when you move
all that around and you rationalize it too, we believe it's still in line with medical inflation. We're comfortable with our
incurred loss trends for BI. And as Steve said in his response to the reserving question, don't confuse some of these
operational claims statistics with profitability and reserving. When we are setting reserves, when that team is working
on the reserves, they know about the claims process enhancements. They take the impact of those changes into account
when setting reserves. They are doing very sophisticated segmented analysis. And so while the claims process changes
will influence those statistics you see on paid severity and paid frequency, they're not influencing the reserves.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes are the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your question, please.
<Q - Amit Kumar>: Thanks, and good morning. I'll make this quick. Two questions. The first question goes back to, I
guess, Elyse's question on the trends. When you talk about catching up to the spike and you know also address miles
driven, distracted driving, pedestrian fatalities, I'm curious, why shouldn't I be nervous that these trends will continue at
an elevated level and hence it's too early to start normalizing pricing? I mean we've just caught up to the past trend, but
it seems all the indicators point to a continued change in the slope of this loss cost trends.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Well, thank you for that question. So, it's Matt again. Look, this is what we do. So I don't
mean to be flippant about it, but we have really talented teams of people monitoring these trends on a state and
sub-geography, sub-state level whose job it is to watch net trends emerging and look at indications and ensure that we
are keeping up with them as quickly as possible, consistent with actuarial standards so that we can file for the rates and

convince our state regulators to approve that rates. And this is what we've always done and we think we're
well-positioned to do it.
In fact, coming out of a spike like this, we wanted to benefit. There's always a benefit of going through something like
this as – it hyperfocused us on those troubling segments of the business and allowed us to take segmented rates on
those parts of the business so that we can improve our loss ratios as quickly as possible. So we believe that we have a
high quality book at this point. We believe that we know where the segments that we need to keep an eye on are. We
believe we've gotten those segments rate-adequate at this point. And so, we feel very comfortable with being able to
manage some continued inflation and some continued rise in escalation in some of these costs.
I will remind you that if we go through that, we will not be going through that alone. Our competitors will be going
through the exact same thing. And we think that we have an advantage with our skill in reacting quickly. We have an
excellent relationship with the state regulators. Our teams have their respect. And so when we do a filing, it's a
complete thorough filing. And we have an extremely high approval ratio and the ability to get rates into the book as
quickly as needed.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Amit, this is Tom. I may add to that. So from our standpoint in pricing, it's only the
now. It's like we look at what the frequency and severity is. We think – we look at it at that moment, it might be March,
April, May, might be August. And whatever it is, we look at the premiums we think we can get and we adjust. And so,
we don't have a fixed assumption in – that is for the year on frequency and severity, that is used in pricing. That's Matt's
explaining. It is very organic.
So when you're doing your models, of course, you're looking and saying, what's the frequency and severity assumption
looking forward. And you have to put something in, and then you have to put in something for price. We do that
continuously by state, by some pieces of state every day. And so, if frequency is two points higher, then we will take
two points more for the rate. If it's two points lower, then we'll decide whether we think that is reasonable or not.
Unlikely we will lower our rates, but we may choose to invest more in expenses to begin to grow the business. And
that's why our range is what it is.
With the 87-89 range we're completely comfortable with. There is, as you know, obviously a 1 to 2 point variation if
you add our frequency and severity over the course of the year. And so, to the extent – but we don't want you to think –
so we lower the range from where it was in 2016, does not mean that we think you should take 2016 numbers and
lower that by the same amount. That's not the way we do it. It's not the way we run the business.
<Q - Amit Kumar>: I guess I'm just a glass-half-empty kind of guy. The other question I had and switching topics
here is a broader discussion on corporate taxation. If the taxes were to go down, does that get reflected in your pricing
actions? I know it's all hypothetical or should we anticipate that netting down to your bottom line? Thanks.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Taxes are of course complicated thing as it relates to Allstate. The first and probably
the biggest impact is when it relates to taxes if it drives economic growth that's good for the company because we're
low on U.S. growth, whether that is our investment portfolio or the growth in auto ownership and home ownership. So
both of those could be very good for us.
As it relates to – you're at then one component of it, which is if you look at our P&L, I'll go way up and then I will get
back to pricing. We are a full taxpayer. We don't have – our industry does not have all kinds of special deductions. We
think U.S. taxes should be based and corporations should pay based on what they use, not some centralized view of
how you control the economy. We know centralized planning doesn't work and using the tax codes to drive
decentralized plans and drive certain industries doesn't make sense to us. As a result of that, though, there are a number
of industries and companies that pay a lot less tax than that, we think it should be more of an even playing field. And so
we think our tax rate should be lower. That would obviously immediately be good for our earnings because we would
have less cash we have to pay out every year in taxes.
What happens to pricing then really depends on the individual state you're in, where you are in pricing that piece. I
would make a couple of comments. One, I would reiterate what Matt said. While price is important, we don't look at
price as the only lever to growth. We think price is what we have to charge relative to the value we provide. But Matt's

working hard on providing more value rather than just let's be the cheapest in town.
And then it also depends there's a variety of other facts, which would rattle through the pricing besides just the tax rate
used in determining our return on capital. What happens to interest rates? What happens to inflation in that scenario?
So there's a whole bunch of other, I would say, secondary and tertiary, but linked economic things that would rattle
through pricing. Net-net, I believe a lower tax rate would be good for Allstate in the short term.
<Q - Amit Kumar>: Thanks there for the thorough answer, and good luck for the future.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please?
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Thanks. Good morning. The first question I had was just on expectations for share buybacks 2017.
Should we be thinking about the 2016 pace of $1.4 billion as a reasonable run rate?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Hi, Jay. This is Tom. So I think you should think about we still have $651 million yet
to go, so you can put that in the bank that we fully expect to get that done by the time its authorization was up, which is
late in 2018. Based on the pace we're going, it looks like we'll be done sooner than the authorization. And then what we
should have in there is – then we'll look at where we are in terms of capital and we'll make the same judgment we make
every other year, which is between that and the dividend, how much cash can we return to shareholders? And if we
don't have a use for it, we return it. So share repurchases will continue to be part of what we do. But we don't have a set
number that we're ready to tee up because we've still got a ways to go on the existing share repurchase program.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Okay. And then on the Allstate Brand Auto rate increases, I believe the expectation now is for those
rate – the pace of rate increase is to moderate in 2017. How much do you think that could slow?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: I'm sorry.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: How much do you think the pace of rate increases in Allstate Brand Auto insurance
could slow from the extremely successful 75% you had this year. Sorry, Jay, I was just helping out with the question.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Great. With the editorial comments. Thank you.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: No, no. That was – I'm going to let Tom ask all the questions from now on. I wish I could
tell you. I can only tell you that we've done catching up as I said earlier. So when you're in catch-up mode, you're
sprinting and you're taking as much as you can in order to get rate adequate and to clean up the bookings and get to
where you're earning an appropriate return on the business. And it feels like in about probably three quarters of the
states, we will be reducing that level of rate. We will not be taking the kind of rate we took in 2016. That being said if
we see additional pressure, we're going to take that rate.
So I keep coming back to the same thing that both Tom and I have said during this call. We do have some assumptions
about where loss costs are going to go next year, but they're just that. They're just assumptions and they're not a plan.
Our plan is to keep up with lost cost as they emerge and take rate necessary in order to do that. So to the extent we –
reality meets our forecast and we have a stabilization of frequency trends and severity trends where they are now, I
would expect us to see moderated rate need as we're keeping up with what is more normal inflationary trends at that
point.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: That makes perfect sense. Thank you.

<Q - Sarah E. DeWitt>: Hi. Good morning. On the auto insurance margin, just to clarify, are you at your target auto
margin on a GAAP basis now or is there still room to improve? And then the reason I ask is because the Allstate Brand
Auto margin would've been 97% ex the 2 points of favorable development.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Yeah, Sarah, thanks for the question. I was hoping Tom would have asked this one so he
would ask it differently. We're – we still have room to improve. I think we feel really good about the progress that
we've made. And we feel like we are earning an appropriate return on our investment at this point, but it's not our target
return yet and we will continue.
And that's multiple levers that the claims management, that's expense efficiency, that's additional rate, it's additional
work on quality of the book, it's correct class work, it's underwriting work, it's all the things that we did really, really
strongly to get back to profitability. But all those levers are the same levers we need continue to pull. We just – now we
can dial them instead of pulling them really hard. We can dial them carefully and thoughtfully to get that to our target
returns, but we're a lot closer than we've been for a while to where we want to be, but our work is not over.
<Q - Sarah E. DeWitt>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just on the auto severity, I apologize if you addressed this, but
it was a bit confusing. My sense is your encouragements are consistent, but we've heard one of your competitors saying
they are seeing much higher severity from more occupants per vehicle, more fatalities, higher legal costs. It sounds like
you acknowledged some of those, but it doesn't seem like you're seeing any of this in your encouragement. Can you
just clarify that?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I think you're over-reading into what we said about that. There are normal inflationary
costs embedded in our BI. So I'm not – other people are saying they got lots of stuff and it's driving – ours are just
normal, like – and we incur it that way. We show you paid, but that's not the way – we use paid to help us think about
how we reserve, but it's not the way we crank the P&L. We crank the P&L on what we think is going to happen, we
think it's normal.
Maybe answer a question on the slightly longer perspective on the combined ratio. So you know, we had great returns
in the auto insurance business for 12 plus years, which showed us that the market was willing to give us the economic
rents based on the value we provided. And then in 2015, we had this huge spike in frequency and severity. And as Matt
said, Oh, we don't like that. We like those old returns better. And so we had to move quickly. Our team did. They
executed well, and we moved those returns up. Are we back to the amount of return we had for that period of time, for
that 12 years, no. But are we in a fundamentally different position today where we feel like now what we should do is
thinking about how we get there and over what period of time we get there, then whether we can get there. And that's
the process. That is the Allstate Brand.
Esurance is in a slightly different position. It's had a good movement throughout the year. Picked it up mostly in the
first half of the year. We're watching the fourth quarter because it bumped up a little bit. And if its frequency and
severity trends increase, it does the same thing that Matt described. It's the nows, whatever happens in Encompass, we
feel like we've got some – we had some good success this year as one of you pointed out, we finally managed to get
some underwriting income out of that business. And we're happy that it's now positioned well. And so we got it – but
it's in the same place. So, we're feeling good about the process and the way the machine works here to help us manage
whatever comes our way. And that's what you're buying. You're buying the machine, not somebody's projections on
frequency and severity.
<Q - Sarah E. DeWitt>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Maybe we will take one last question and then we'll close. Bob, I think it was Bob? I

<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Thanks for squeezing me in, Tom. Two quickies. On SquareTrade, appreciate the increased
disclosure. Is there any more color on what the goodwill is going to be? And is that going to be excluded of the
Esurance or included in core earnings?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: So we just bought it as you know, Bob, last month. So we don't have any updated
numbers. We obviously are working hard at coming up with the split between goodwill and intangibles are. I missed
your second question?
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Is it going to be included or excluded in the core earnings? The goodwill piece.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: The goodwill, only tangibles are amortized and they're excluded from operating
income.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Okay.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Definition of operating income.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Got you . And one other quickie. The life earnings were up by more than the partnership
delta. Mary Jane, was there anything unusual or recurring in that bump up in the earnings level in the quarter?
<A - Mary Jane Bartolotta Fortin>: So profit Financial, Bob, really for the Annuities, you had the benefit of the
performance-based investments that we've alluded to. That was at 13.8%. We also did have favorable mortality as well
in both the Annuity business and the Life business. So we did have a favorable quarter from a mortality perspective
impacting the results.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: But – so that what she is saying, don't multiply it by four.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: I knew the bump up in partnership income was not recurring, but it was more than that. It
was a $20 million to $30 million more than just the increase in partnerships. But mortality could explain some of that.
Thanks.

<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Okay. I'll go through it with John. Appreciate it.
<A - John Griek>: Yeah, okay. Let's do that.
