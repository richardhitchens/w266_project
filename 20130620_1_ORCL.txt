few prepared remarks.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal 2013, then I'll review the
guidance for Q1 and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. My remarks generally reflect
constant dollar growth rates.
This quarter we saw a record $4 billion in new software license and SaaS subscriptions coming within my guidance
range at 2% constant growth. In general, sales force execution improved significantly in most regions during the
quarter. As with most of our peers we did see increased economic weakness in a few regions, which had an effect on
our final performance. Geographically results were somewhat mixed with GAAP new license growing 4% in the
Americas, up 5% in the EMEA, but down 7% in APAC.
I'd highlight places like Brazil, which pulled down our growth in the Americas, and a number of countries in Asia,
especially Australia, as being particularly affected by economic slowdowns beyond our expectations. Europe's
economy remains unchanged, and we're actually pleased with our European performance. In addition, in Q4 we saw
currency headwinds, especially in Japan, Brazil and Australia, where currencies weakened 5% to 8% against the dollar
since our last earnings call in moves that were not anticipated in my Q4 guide.
Software support revenues were $4.4 billion, up 8% on this recurring part of our business. Support, attach and renewal
rates continue at their usual high levels. Hardware systems revenue was better than expected at $849 million, as our
Engineered Systems had another spectacular quarter. We also saw growth in our T-Series SPARC servers, following a
new product launch earlier in the quarter. With some new M-Series now available, I think we're starting to see
customers refresh their systems, and we believe that we could have growth in total hardware as early as Q1.
Hardware gross margins were 51%, reflecting our strategy to focus only on high-value systems, and the return of
hardware growth should actually help increase gross margins even more over time.
Total revenue for the quarter was nearly $11 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.6
billion with operating margins expanding to 51% from 50% last year. Aside from the five quarters immediately
following the Sun acquisition, non-GAAP operating margins have expanded year-over-year every quarter since
November 2006 and we actually continue to see ample leverage in our business model.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% and the GAAP tax rate was 21.1%. Non-GAAP earnings per share
were $0.87 and would've been actually $0.01 higher, but for the negative impact of currency, up from $0.82 last year.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.80, up from $0.69 last year. Operating cash flow increased to $14.2 billion over the
last four quarters and free cash flow grew to $13.6 billion over the last four quarters. Both are record results. We now
have $32.2 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Now for the full fiscal year and for the first time ever, our new software sales were more than $10 billion, growing 6%
in constant currency. Together new software license and support – and software support grew 7%, averaging 10% over
the last five years, and our last major software acquisition was more than five years ago. While hardware and hardware
support declined 14%, I think we may have just seen the last of annual hardware revenue declines, which will have
positive implications for total revenue.
Even with the declines in hardware revenues, total revenues for the year grew 2% to more than $37 billion. Our
non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was an all-time high of 47%. Earnings per share per share was $2.68,
growing 11% in FY 2013. Since we first shared our goal of growing non-GAAP EPS 20% over time back in 2005,
we've averaged nearly 19% growth for both EPS and free cash flow over the last eight years even though the world
went through a massive economic crisis.

In Q4 we purchased nearly 85 million shares for a total of $2.8 billion, and for the full year, we purchased nearly 350
million shares for a total of $11 billion. So as you saw in our release, today we announced we are re-starting our
quarterly dividend earlier than previously planned and with a 100% increase to our quarterly dividend or $0.12 per
share. This will commence with a record date of July 12 and a payout date of August 2. The board also authorized the
repurchase of an additional $12 billion of common stock under our existing share repurchase program in future
quarters.
Between dividend and buybacks, this year we returned more than $12.4 billion or more than 90% of our free cash flow
to our shareholders. Today we also announced that we've applied to list our common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange under our current symbol, ORCL. And subject to approval by the NYSE, we expect our common stock will
begin trading on the NYSE on July 15. Now until the transfer is completed, Oracle will continue to trade on the
NASDAQ under our current symbol.
Now moving to guidance. I will say in advance that I continue to follow the news of the economy and the results of
nearly every one of our competitors, so I have tried to keep that in mind in my guidance. And since I don't know what
the exchange rates will be at quarter-end, I'm going to give guidance in constant currency.
Now at current rates, currency will reduce growth rates by about 1% and general growth rates, license and revenue and
EPS by about $0.02. That's what it looks like right now. So with guidance, new software license and cloud subscription
revenue is expected to range from 0% to 8% in constant currency in non-GAAP and 1% to 9% in GAAP. Hardware
product revenue growth is expected to range from a negative 6% to a positive 2% in constant currency, and as a result
total revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 6% in constant dollars.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.59 in constant dollar. GAAP EPS is expected to
be somewhere between $0.42 and $0.45 in constant dollar. This guidance assumes GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of
24% of course and it may end up being different.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.
Mark V. Hurd
Thanks, Safra. Just today I thought I'd be brief and talk a little bit about our cloud business and give you some facts.
Our cloud now runs well over $1 billion run rate and it's bigger than both Workday and SAP combined in the cloud.
We are clearly the second largest provider in the SaaS market with more than 130 Fusion customers that are live in
production today. In Q4 alone we added 500 new SaaS customers, 300 of those in HCM alone.
Not only are we bigger than Workday in HCM, but we are growing faster than Workday. They recently claim to have
added 50 new customers in HCM and ERP. We added more than 50 in HCM alone and with more than 80 new Fusion
SaaS customers, we had great SaaS HCM wins at British Telecom, BMC Software, Siemens, Credit Agricole, Yahoo!
and Intuit.
In customer experience we added 200 customers with great cloud wins at eBay, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Trimble
Navigation, Dow Corning, Sprint Nextel, Capital One, US Foods, Acer, Tesco and PACCAR. I just read you that list
just so you'd get an idea of the quality of the brand names that are committing to our technology. So our success in the
cloud is significant and undeniable.
Let me share a few facts with you about how we run our cloud. The cloud runs on our engineered systems. We have
nearly 13,000 VMs, 70 petabytes of storage in seven countries, more than 7.6 million users and 16.5 million – or billion
transactions per day.
Let me switch to our pipeline. It's healthy. Our sales organization is already geared to outperform our competitors. I
want to say this again. Our attrition rates are down. They have declined. And by June 7, that's roughly two weeks ago,
we had 90% of our territory assignments and quotas done with sales plans accepted. That is an absolute record for
Oracle. Now next week I want you to stay tuned because we're going to make a series of announcements regarding our

success in the cloud and the partnerships we're forming to drive our cloud business forward.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Larry so that he can touch on some of our exciting developments in hardware.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Mark.
In engineered systems we had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up approximately 50% as we took considerable
market share from our primary competitor, IBM pSeries, which was down 32% in their most recent quarter. All our
Exa products: Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics, and the Big Data Appliance and the Oracle Database Appliance all had
their best ever quarters.
In bookings we sold over 1,200 engineered systems in Q4, including more than 600 Exadatas. Exalogic was up more
than 50% sequentially and we sold more than 100 units of Exalytics in the quarter. For the year we sold over 3,000
engineered systems, more than all the previous years combined: Tesco, Fidelity, Siemens, McGraw-Hill, Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, Saudi Telecom to name just a few of the companies that bought engineered systems this past
quarter.
Some of SAP's largest customers, giant German industrial companies, bought Exadata, not HANA, to run their SAP
applications. We virtually never see HANA in the market and SAP's HANA numbers simply don't add up. A recent
analyst report pointed out that if you believe the HANA sales growth numbers in SAP's most recent quarterly report
then SAP's application business must have declined 10%.
You decide. Either HANA is doing well and SAP's application business is in steep decline or HANA is not doing so
well, but SAP's application business is okay. You can't have it both ways. We don't think SAP's HANA can ever
successfully compete with Oracle's Exadata and our other engineered systems in the high-performance database
market.
Engineered systems are now over one third of Oracle's hardware revenue. Our SPARC server line is now completely
refreshed. Our T5 and M5 servers feature the fastest microprocessor in the world, faster than Intel and faster than IBM
P 7+ on numerous industry standard benchmarks. With the continued rapid growth of our now much larger Engineered
Systems business plus our new high-performance SPARC T5 and M5 servers we just might see overall hardware
growth this Q1 and we will see overall hardware growth for the full fiscal year.
Kenneth Bond
Thank you, Larry. Amber, we can now move to the Q&A portion of the call, please.

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Hi. Thank you very much. Good to see the hardware product and the Fusion reference
really do well. But on the software side typically Oracle has had very strong May quarter finishes, we've always called
it the magic of May quarter. I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more color, Safra, Mark, or Larry, on if you
saw any slippage that was specific to – more so to the Applications business, large ticket items, economically more
sensitive if these deals are put on hold? And how is the linearity shaping up in June? As you exited the quarter did you
feel a little bit better about how the trends were getting better? Because we've been hearing about software companies
facing difficulties in the months of March and April. I'm just curious how things shaped up and how you exited the

quarter? Sorry for the bunch of questions but I really appreciate the color. Thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: I don't know which one of us should start. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks we saw
some weakness in specific regions especially Asia-Pacific, especially parts of Latin America that were – that came up
right at the end on us and that was extremely disappointing for us because May is usually our very, very big and
important month and it's our big quarter and it sort of lays out where it did. We've had a pretty good start actually, in
the other regions but it's too soon to tell on and that's why my guidance is where it is.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Let me add it was no specific product. I mean when we saw weakness we saw weakness in
database, middleware, applications, in all of our software lines. So it was clearly an economic issue, not a product
competitive issue. The products performed kind of as we expected, it's just that they didn't reach the ceiling we thought
we were going to reach in the quarter.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I'll add a little bit of color too, Kash, that I think we actually did pretty darn well in Europe. We
actually felt quite good. Considering all you read, you talked about what you read about software companies. You read
a lot about the tech sector in Europe and frankly as we've talked before, the sales force adds we've done there has been
material and it's helped for us.
We banked on conversion rates being down in Europe and frankly they weren't down as much as we thought. We
executed quite well. We did fine in the U.S. and to Safra's points really it was, for us, Brazil and parts of Asia where we
saw it. The rest of everything sort of behaved the way we expected over the course of the year with the exception – of
the quarter with perhaps the exception of Engineered Systems to the good which was better than we expected going in
which led to the hardware performance that we've described.
On a number of transactions basis, some of it, to Larry's point, really has to do with the transactions just getting a bit
skinnier. If you looked at number of transactions – excuse me – you wouldn't see that big a delta. A lot of it just had to
do with the average size per transaction, which again indicates to us certainly a lot of economic issue out there.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Got it. Thank you. And, Safra, it does look like you feel a little bit better based on the
guidance, which was a lot better than we would've expected for the upcoming August quarter for licenses especially.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yes. Well, we saw things pushed off. I see them closing, but I do have to keep an eye on what
my competitors are reporting and what's going on. So it's sort of all in there together and we feel good with where we're
guiding.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Mark, you're adding tremendous sales capacity and you mentioned the
unforced attrition is down. So why do you think you're not seeing the resulting fall through in license results? I
certainly understand the comments you made about Asia-Pacific but it is a small percent of your overall revenue and
maybe if you could just expand on the ASP in Q3? I think you disclosed that that was down high teens as it relates to
deals over $3 million. It seems like the larger deals are still seeing pressure. If you could just add a little more color that
would be helpful.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah, let me just jump in in front of Mark and give you our view. We've been adding a lot
of sales people in the cloud. So a lot of our additions in Europe and in North America is around our cloud offerings,
which we're seeing great growth. So we think as part of the transition to the cloud, the bulk of the sales adds are not in
our traditional on-premises database business or on-premises application business. The bulk of the adds have been in
our cloud businesses and will continue to add. We've hired about 500 salespeople and sales consultants directly out of
college this year. And virtually all of them will go to our cloud businesses and about 10% of them will go to our Linux
business, which is becoming very, very competitive with Red Hat. But it's the new businesses that we're in that is

absorbing most, not all, but most of our sales adds.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah, so I think you got, Brent, everything Larry said and then add to it that where we have
added, because we are still even with that add in the cloud net up in our traditional license areas. Although it's not all of
what we've added, to Larry's point. But we have seen the benefits. I'll tell you exactly, in Europe we have seen bigger
pipelines and we've seen the economic pressure on the conversion rate and that growth you see in Europe is directly
related to the fact that we've added to our sales force.
So make no mistake about it, the growth in our pipeline that you see in Latin America when you see some of these
issues in Brazil, this is what happens when you see an economic environment like this. You see the pipe go up, you see
conversion go down, if you're going to gain share you're going to have to be in more deals. So we are in more deals.
Let me give you a second point. Historically when these economies turn, you do not have enough time to rehire your
distribution capability to take advantage of the change in the economy. If that pipe is not sitting there when markets get
better, you lose out on that expansion. So this is actually – it's counterintuitive, I know. This is the right time to be in a
position with a broader distribution capability.
I'll add to it we've been very mindful of our expenses while we've done it. So when you look at our expense structure
we have taken money from other places and funded the majority of this sales force expansion. Now to Larry's point,
some of this is now going into "ARR", annual recurring revenue, which we're seeing strong growth, which will pay us
dividends as you go out over the next couple of years.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thank you.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Good afternoon. I have two questions. First, Mark, can we drill down a little more into
Asia-Pacific? Because if you look at the different regions on a constant currency basis, U.S. and EMEA both actually
performed maybe about as expected but essentially when you dive into APAC, the last two quarters, that really fell off
the cliff after a strong start of the year. So I'd love to get a little bit more color maybe by Australia and some of the
different countries in there, what you're seeing?
And then the second question for Larry is just as you look out the next four quarters, Safra made the comment about the
Hardware business turning potentially positive in Q1. What are some of the assumptions that you guys see by product
within engineered systems and the SPARC product lines that could get you to that level of actually showing
year-over-year hardware product revenue growth? Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay. Multi-part question. I'll tackle the first part. I think you're right, by the way, in the way
you described the quarter for us. We saw roughly what we expected in Europe, in fact a little bit better than what we
expected, and roughly what we expected in the Americas.
Asia, as you know, there is no real Asia, per se. It's a little different behavior by country. We continue to see pressure in
China as you read across most of the other tech companies described. We saw that. And we have the effect that Safra
mentioned in Australia. That is both some weakness in the Australian market, which you also see as a read through in
their economy, but frankly going up against a big prior year.
So we had a big prior year in Australia and we had the economic issue that you saw. Those are the two markets. We did
fine in Korea and fine in India overall.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: On the Hardware side of the question, it's really very, very simple. We had a number of
businesses, the other Sun businesses, the commodity x86 business that we have exited and we're pretty much out of,
reselling other people's storage systems, like Hitachis and LSI Logics, which we're pretty much out of. And so those
declining businesses kind of have finished declining.

We think the businesses that remain, we've got two big businesses that remain, one is the SPARC server business,
which is now refreshed and we think can grow, though that is not in our assumption for growth. Our only assumption
for growth is that our Engineered Systems business, which has consistently grown and grew very rapidly this quarter,
will continue to grow. And that alone, that alone will drive the overall Hardware business into growth. If we recover
with our new SPARC line, if that recovers and also shows just a little bit of growth, the growth in Hardware will be
spectacular.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if, Larry, you could help us frame how the
upcoming release of 12c could differ from past cycles in terms of license growth rates. And I guess the follow-on to
that would be related to plugable database containers. I'm just wondering if you could share with us whether or not that
will be part of people's maintenance contracts or whether that will be a paid option? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay. The 12c is a multi-tenant database. 12c stands for the cloud. It's the first time a
database confers multi-tenancy to the applications that run on the database. As you know, the cloud business started
about 15 years ago with a little company called NetSuite and then there came Salesforce and many others and what
they had to do was build multi-tenancy into the application. If they wanted to run a lot of customers' data on a small
number of servers and do that economically, they had to build a multi-tenant capability directly into their applications,
which has certain problems. It has security problems. It means that your standard report writers won't work. A lot of
standard tools just won't work because of this multi-tenancy application architecture.
The next kind of phase of multi-tenancy was virtual machine. VMs became a very, very popular way of sharing
hardware, sharing servers, but unfortunately that has significant overhead, much more overhead than kind of the
NetSuite, Salesforce way of doing it in the applications. We think the right way to confer multi-tenancy on applications
and keep security working and use the hardware very, very efficiently is to put multi-tenancy at the database layer. And
that's what we've done with 12c. It is a separately priced option.
Next week we will be announcing technology partnerships with the most important, let me be clear, the most – largest
and most important SaaS companies and infrastructure companies in the cloud, and they will be using our technology,
committing to our technology for years to come. That's how important we think 12c. We think 12c will be the
foundation of a modern cloud where you get multi-tenant applications with a high degree of security and a high degree
of efficiency, where you don't have to sacrifice one for the other.
Again, we have – again, I would call them startling series of announcements with companies like Salesforce.com,
NetSuite, Microsoft, all to happen next week; we'll be giving you the details. These partnerships in the cloud I think
will reshape the cloud and reshape the perception of Oracle technology in the cloud. 12c, in other words, is the most
important technology we've ever developed for this new generation of cloud computing.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Maybe I'd add something a little more mundane than that is that our database options business
was really strong in the quarter, Heather. I mean, when you look at GoldenGate, security, compression, very strong
performance for us in the quarter and certainly when you see some of the people that have jumped on these capabilities:
databases, enterprises, managers, strong growth in the quarter, our database options business in the quarter, very, very
strong.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Okay. Great. Thank you. Next question, please.

We'll go next to Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Thanks. Larry, just two questions for you, if you can update us on a couple things. First, you
talked at Oracle World about some cloud services. I know you've got private-public hybrid cloud you articulated. I
wondered if you could update us on what's happening there?
And then second, in terms of in-memory capability, just reading the trades, there's been a lot of speculation that you're
going to deliver some kind of compatible – some kind of in-memory capabilities that are compatible with the Oracle
database. If you could share any thoughts with us on that?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay, Rick, happy to. Oracle participates at all three layers of cloud. We're really kind of
a unique cloud company. We're, as Mark pointed out, the second largest SaaS provider in the world. We added 500
new SaaS customers alone, 500 new logos at the SaaS layer this past quarter. We actually had more – now let me be
clear, not Taleo logos. We had more new Fusion CRM. I'll be very clear. Take out Taleo. Don't count it. Just look at
our Fusion HCM, look at our Fusion HCM customers. We added more new Fusion core HCM customers last quarter
than Workday added their HCM plus ERP customers. That's just Fusion, not Taleo.
We're growing very fast in the cloud and especially the HCM cloud, especially Fusion HCM. And as Mark pointed out,
we're larger in SaaS than anyone but Salesforce.com. We're larger than Workday and SAP combined.
Okay, but that's not the only layer we compete in, SaaS. We compete at the platform layer, and if you kind of look at
Oracle historically, that's where you'd expect us to be strongest. These are our two brands in PaaS: the Oracle database
and Java. Those are the two most important platforms on the face of the earth for building applications. They – both
products are dominant. There are more than 9 million Java developers.
On our platform business, our cloud platform business, we have over 5,000 customers on our cloud. Mark mentioned
our cloud services: 6,000 servers, 12,000 VMs, almost 70 petabytes of storage in 11 locations around the world, almost
8 million users per day and over 16 billion transactions per day. Mark mentioned all those numbers.
But again, we have over 34 – we announced our service last – our platform service last OpenWorld and now we have
over 3,500 or over 3,400 customers on the Oracle database cloud and another 1,700 in the Java cloud, and that's just the
beginning. We think our PaaS business is one of our huge, huge competitive advantages, where you tend to think of –
the big cloud players are either in SaaS, like a Salesforce.com, or in infrastructure, like Amazon. You really don't think
of a real strong PaaS player.
Well, that's where we think we have a huge advantage and we think that accrues to our big SaaS customers because
when you buy a SaaS product it doesn't mean you're not going to build other little things yourself in the cloud to go
along with the SaaS products you buy. And with Salesforce.com, which they're the market leader and I have a great
deal of respect for what Mark Benioff has achieved over there. I think he's done a good job. But they started a long time
ago and they have a platform called Force.com, which is not based on industry standards.
So when you make additions to Salesforce.com, you write in Salesforce's proprietary platform. When you make
additions to our SaaS applications you use the Oracle database and Java, the industry standards. So we think customers
are going to look at the entire cloud and assess the quality of the applications, SaaS, the quality of the platform and we
don't think any of the big cloud players can compete with us at the platform layer. And of course the quality of the
infrastructure, which Mark mentioned earlier, which is our engineered systems, which again we think gives us a big
competitive advantage.
So the combination of 12c for the cloud, which we think will be adopted by most, most of the big cloud players, as well
as our corporate customers as they build clouds inside their firewall, is huge and we think the advantage – another
advantage that we offer is the clouds that our customers are going to run internally made up of Oracle and Java is the
same cloud that we offer in our public cloud. So they can build applications and move them back and forth. They could
build an application in Oracle and Java on our public cloud and move it back to their private cloud. They can take an
application that runs in their private cloud and move it to the public cloud. They can do test and development in the
public cloud and run it in their private cloud because our cloud is based on industry standards. Our platform is based on

industry standards. We're the only company that's doing this, very optimistic about our ability to compete in the cloud.
Again, I said earlier we're going through this transition where we moved a lot of our lot of our new sales guys, again
not all, a lot of our new sales guys to the cloud. So we're moving aggressively to sell not only our applications but our
database and Java and our infrastructure in the cloud. We're investing a lot in engineering, we're investing a lot in sales
because we think the opportunity is gigantic and we're well-positioned with a key new enabling technology called
Oracle 12c database.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Operator, next call, please – question, please.

We'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Hi. Safra, I'm wondering if you could – we heard a lot about the cloud here and SaaS and
I'm wondering if you could help us understand both near-term and longer-term the impact of that on license revenue,
how that may be depressing what we're seeing on that end?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Well, at this point the reality is that most of our customers are application customers that are
taking some cloud offerings, are doing it as a complementary offering and to what they've already got on-site. So it's
not necessarily – now if all of our application customers overnight all, gosh I don't know 10,000 of them overnight
switched to SaaS, then that might have an effect. But we have so many customers and the dynamics are such that many
are adding on and some are adding on on-premise, some are adding on on-cloud and some of them are replacing
on-premise with cloud. We have such a large base that net, net we have growth. So that's the dynamic right now. In the
event that everyone tomorrow switched over, well that would have a different effect. But that's not likely to happen.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Let me add my comment, which is we think when someone chooses an Oracle application
in the cloud versus an Oracle application on-premise, we make more money over time. Now the order that revenue
comes in is a little bit different because we take it ratably rather than a big chunk up front. But we think when someone
becomes a cloud customer that is an economically more valuable customer to us over time than when someone buys
our software on-premise. So we think over a reasonable term, we benefit tremendously from the movement to the
cloud.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah, add to it, Walter, there's other dynamics at play here. Because of the way our software is
architected, we can sell by module. So in many ways it opens up brand new markets to us. We can go sell to an SAP
customer a module of HCM. They can buy recruiting from us. They don't have to "rip and replace." Somebody like a
Workday actually has to do a lot more rip and replace than we would. We can go in, supplement many of our
application users today with their core on-premise app with new modules of our SaaS Fusion application. So actually in
some ways long run we're going to have to go through the ARR phase where we start building up our ARR as we go,
but it opens up new markets that we haven't had available to us before.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.

We'll go next to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi. Thanks, guys. Just got two questions actually. First back on the hardware side,
obviously we've talked a lot about Engineered Systems but wondering if you could give us an update on the M5 and the
T5. I know it's early but just what are you hearing from customers about those two new processors and sets of servers?

And then kind of flipping gears back to the software front, Mark, I know the two of us have talked about your customer
experience, management solutions from CRM to marketing to commerce. How is that set of products doing? And with
some of the changes competitively out there with Salesforce buying ExactTarget and Hybris going to SAP, just how do
you think your product's launch is set up there? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay. I'll start with the first part of your question, which was hardware. The T-Series is
growing nicely. And again, I mentioned that's not part of our assumption for growth for hardware for the entire year.
That's heavily weighted to Engineered Systems, Exadata, SPARC SuperCluster, et cetera. But T is growing nicely and
there's huge interest in our M-Series machine. The interesting thing about the M5 as opposed to the T5, the M5 has 32
terabytes of DRAM. It is designed to be an in-memory machine. We will announce at the end of the year that Oracle
12.1c, 12.1c is an in-memory database and it is designed to work exceedingly well with our M-Series machines, again
which have more memory, by the way, than any other computer on planet Earth. It's an SMP machine with 32 sockets
and 32 terabytes of DRAM.
And we have designed that machine in concert with the next version of our database, which comes out at the end of the
year, which is a vertical columnar compressed in-memory vertical database. And we think one of the reasons I was
very confident that SAP HANA could never compete with Oracle over the long term is because of 12.1c. And again,
we combine that software technology with our latest M-series in-memory – large-scale in-memory machines and we
think nothing can touch it. And by the way, that machine is not very expensive.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah, and to add to it, T5 has taken off faster than T4. T4, we've talked about the growth we've
seen in T4 while we've seen the reduction in M, which is fundamentally what's happened to the SPARC line. The T5 –
and that's early days still so we're going to have to see how it unfolds but I'd say it's very encouraging from the numbers
we saw both in the quarter in orders and in the pipeline. And there is a large installed base of SPARC that's out there
for us to go sell into, particularly on the high-end.
To your question, I think your question was on ATG and Endeca, ThoughtWire, which is basically the foundation of
our commerce server and what we'll call our customer experience, very strong numbers. We just don't lose deals. So at
the end of the day when you get into that space and you've seen it particularly too in the retail industry, many of the big
retailers that are focusing on how to connect to their customer, how to engage the customer, how they cross-sell and
upsell to that customer, that's at the core fabric of what they deploy. We expect to see that same sort of behavior in the
telecommunications industry, financial services industry, and we love our position and we don't believe any effect of
our competitive position rides on SAP's acquisition or what Salesforce has done.
Remember one more time: the leader in marketing automation software is Oracle. Eloqua is the leader. So it is not
anybody else. And we've got a head start and we did very well. I even mentioned in my comments, Eloqua did very
well in the quarter in terms of its ARR. So we like our aggregate hand. We like our position with RightNow on the
service side. We like our position on the commerce side with ATG. We like our position on the marketing side with
Eloqua, so we feel good about where we sit.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah, let me just kind of summarize what Mark said where you think of Salesforce.com as
a company that has a very strong foothold in companies that sell B2B. We think we have an equally strong foothold in
companies that sell B2C. So while we think we're going to be – aggressively compete with Salesforce where we think
we have a huge competitive advantage where our number one competitor actually turns out to be IBM in that space, we
just don't lose deals to IBM in e-commerce.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.

We'll take our final question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Keith Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for fitting me. Maybe I'll ask one for Safra. In terms of the guidance
into Q1 can you give us a little bit of color in terms sort of the conservatism you used in setting that guide, maybe talk a

little bit about close rates assumption and how you're thinking about – how you thought about the guide?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yeah, well, as I said, first of all, I get a, as you know, I get a rollup from the field and I look at
the different close rates that we've had historically and the numbers that we're using right now assume a slightly lower
close rate than we have historically and takes into account the difference we've been experiencing especially this
quarter and in Q3. I have to know what's going on with our competitors and since even deals that didn't close this
quarter, they were not lost to competitors, they were either pushed off or, what also shows up in close rates, or they
became smaller by a certain percentage and so that's really what we apply. So I'm not going to quantify it for you but
I've assumed a few points lower than would be typical for a Q1, especially since a number of the Q4 deals especially
have closed already. So I just had to pretty much take into account what we've been seeing for the past couple of
quarters and apply that to the pipeline.
<Q - Keith Weiss>: Excellent, very helpful.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay.
