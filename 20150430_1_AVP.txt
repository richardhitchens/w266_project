MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Holly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to Avon's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I'll now turn the conference over to Amy Chasen, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. Ms. Chasen, you may
begin your conference.
Amy Low Chasen
Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Avon's first quarter 2015 results. As always, I'm here
with Sheri McCoy, Avon's CEO. I'm also very pleased to introduce our new Executive Vice President and CFO, Jim
Scully, who joined us in early March. Bob Loughran, our Corporate Controller, is also with us today.
Sheri will make some opening remarks including her perspective on our progress. Jim will then take you through our
first quarter results and provide some perspective on his areas of focus in the coming months. Then, we will have our
usual Q&A session.
With that, I refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliation, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our
website. As usual on the call, we will focus on these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Our call will also contain
forward-looking statements that concern our business and financial strategies as well as outlook including cash flow
and the impact of foreign currency and taxes. These statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in the
cautionary statement in today's 10-Q.

I'll now hand the call over to Sheri.
Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and thank you for joining the call today. I'm thrilled to have Jim here as part of the
team. Today, I'll provide some perspective on our overall performance including our top markets and some brief
commentary on elements of our growth strategy. And then I'll turn it over to Jim, and he will cover our first quarter
results, including an update on the impact of currency, our outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year, and his early
impressions of the business including his areas of focus for the upcoming months.
Before we get started, I wanted to address two topics that I know are top of mind for many of you. First, the media
attention around Avon that you saw earlier this month. Like all companies, our board and senior management reviews
Avon's business strategy on a regular basis. Our goal has been and continues to be to drive sustainable, profitable
growth while creating value for our shareholders and opportunity for our representatives. We will not be saying any
more on this topic on the call today.
Second, the postponement of our Investor Day. As you'll hear from Jim this morning, he's a quick study and already has
a good grasp of the challenges and the nuances of our business, and he's a terrific partner to me, bringing a fresh
perspective to some of our tougher issues. That being said, eight weeks isn't enough time to onboard a new CFO and
execute an effective Investor Day. Together, Jim and I decided to push Investor Day back so that we can have a more
robust discussion in the fall on Avon's strategic priorities.
Turning to first quarter, overall, our operational performance was generally in line with our expectations despite FX
pressure being greater than anticipated. EMEA delivered strong revenue growth across all key markets, led by Russia.
In Latin America, revenue performance improved in Brazil and slowed in Mexico. North America landed where we
anticipated, and Asia Pacific delivered improved performance.
Now, looking at the business through the lens of our top 12 markets.
Generally, I'm pleased with the progress we are making. The teams are executing well and I'm impressed by the agility
we're seeing in our markets, particularly those with the most significant macro challenges. The teams are working very
hard to deliver a compelling value proposition for our consumers and an attractive earnings opportunity for
representatives, while also balancing pricing and margin considerations.
As you know, a big focus of our 2015 plan is improving the representative experience to drive Active Representative
growth. Overall, we saw sequential improvement this quarter versus prior quarters. Two-thirds of our top 12 markets
delivered growth in this critical area, where last year fewer than half were in growth mode. I'm particularly pleased
with the trends we're seeing in Russia, South Africa, Turkey, Poland, Mexico and the Philippines.
Let me give a brief perspective on Brazil, our largest market. Brazil is holding steady in a very challenging economic
environment. This is a great market for us and we continue to invest. The Coty brands are performing well and
contributing to good growth in the Fragrance category.
When I was in Brazil last week for a business review, I participated in the launch of our new KORRES line, which has
its own brochure and is being introduced to a select group of representatives in May. Our top sellers are very excited
about the opportunity to sell this premium and unique product portfolio. The Brazilian team has also been working to
address the impact of the IPI tax, which goes into effect in May and Jim will address this later.
I would also like to make a few comments on the U.S. market. I'm well aware of the unique set of challenges we face in
the U.S. and share your concerns with how long it is taking to get this business back on track. As I've said many times
before, we've made good progress in a number of areas, particularly around cost management. And we continue to
work to improve representative engagement. That being said, we have not yet been able to crack the code on the Active
Representative issue in the United States.

As CEO, it's my job to balance the needs of all stakeholders, including our shareholders and our representatives. We
will continue to monitor progress and evaluate the best path forward for this business. The team is working
aggressively to return to profitability, and improving our Active Representatives remains priority one. I continue to
believe that we can build value for our shareholders, and ideally, enhance opportunities for Representatives in the U.S.
So, looking at the business globally, overall we're feeling good about the progress across most of our key markets. Last
week, I was at our world sales leader meeting, which brings together our top performing division managers from
around the world. It provided a good opportunity to gauge how the field is feeling globally. The mood there was both
optimistic and balanced. They are realistic about the work required to continue to build representative engagement, but
also very enthusiastic about where we are headed.
Next, there are a couple of areas that are important to driving our growth strategy that we had planned to cover at our
May Investor Day. I'll touch on these at a high level to provide you with insights on our plans, mainly around brand and
product category strategy. As I mentioned to you on our last call, we've made good progress across our Beauty category
and are now turning to building our brand and continuing the evolution of our social selling model.
For our Beauty categories, a few things to note. We compete in growing categories: Fragrance, Skincare, and Color.
Our own category performance is improving steadily and we've seen consistent progress over the past few quarters.
Most of this is organic improvement, and where needed, we've augmented our portfolio through our strategic alliances.
The good news is we have terrific and competitive products. Let's start with Fragrance. Fragrance is a category where,
over the years, the quality of some of our products had suffered as we did not keep up with competition and we were
overly cost focused. Across the portfolio, we've improved both packaging and the quality of the juice, and it's having an
impact.
In 2014, we posted strong sales from our two global megahits, Luck for Him and Her and [ph] Sab (8:25). In 2015, we
have more great products in the pipeline. And in Brazil, where Fragrance plays a critical role in the product mix, the
Coty products have helped us fill a few gaps in our portfolio, and as I mentioned earlier, are performing well.
Skincare. On a global basis, Skincare has been showing sequential improvement across the past five quarters. Looking
forward in 2015, we have a number of – we have a new upper mass product line called Nutraeffects, which is launching
in Q2 in EMEA. We also have a couple of key additions to the ANEW line.
Color. While Skincare and Fragrance provide the best earning opportunities for our representatives, Color continues to
be the category that opens doors and drives units. Although we are growing in the Color category, we should be
growing faster in some of our top markets, so this is a key focus for this year. To support this effort, we have a good
lineup of innovation for 2015 in mascara, lipstick and eye color, and we are supporting Color with strong advertising in
a number of markets. So we have strong innovation across our Beauty portfolio in 2015, and we are clear on our
category strategies.
I'm also very excited to introduce to you a new brand positioning for Avon, Beauty for a Purpose. As you all know, the
Avon brand is iconic. From our earliest days, Avon has consistently stood for beauty, for innovation, for optimism, and
above all, for women. The Avon brand has near universal recognition and a history of representing great value for
high-quality products.
While the brand strength and relevance are in different places in various markets, we have the opportunity to
reinvigorate the brand, and that's what we're setting out to do. Avon is an authentically purpose-driven company, which
provides a very compelling story for today's consumers worldwide. We intend to tap into that sentiment as we
strengthen our bond with current consumers and introduce a new generation of consumers to a brand we know they will
love.
You will see that within the Beauty for a Purpose framework, we will be talking about the three areas that define our
purpose. We will tell the story of Avon's beauty products which are of high quality and have demonstrable value;
Avon's earning opportunity, which allows millions of women around the world to build self-reliance and a better life
for themselves and their families; and the network effect of empowered women empowering others.

We are introducing Beauty for a Purpose to our representatives and associates worldwide starting tomorrow and will
then be expanding the positioning to customers with full integration across the business by year-end.
Having a global united view on who we are and why our brand matters is an exciting step forward for Avon. As we
took a fresh look at the brand as well as our overall marketing strategy, we also saw an opportunity to get a better return
on investment for our marketing and advertising efforts. We are completing a thorough review of media mix and spend.
We'll also be looking to shift our marketing mix toward digital and social as we know from experience that our brand
plays extremely well in this area. We are, after all, a word-of-mouth brand.
Alongside our new positioning, we're continuing our evolution to a more social selling model using mobile, digital and
social to support our representatives as they tap into their social circles. This will help representatives sell, keep the
brand top of mind, and appeal to new consumers and representatives alike.
Worldwide, we have a very robust social media presence where our products are being talked about and recommended
every day. With nearly 20 million friends and fans, I can say with confidence that in any market where our customers
are on social media, we are there, too. And avon.com continues to perform well in the U.S., and we're excited about
plans to expand e-commerce to our other markets.
To sum things up, we continue to make progress on our growth agenda of growing Active Representatives, building our
brand and improving consumer access. I'm encouraged by the recent consistency in our performance and believe we're
prepared to weather the ongoing FX pressure.
Our associates are passionately engaged, I'm confident that Avon has a clear opportunity to create value for our
shareholders and opportunity for our representatives.
I'm now going to hand it over to Jim. While Jim's only been here for about eight weeks, we're already benefiting from
his fresh perspective and the energy he has as we tackle some of our more pressing challenges. Jim?
James S. Scully
Thank you, Sheri, and thanks again to all of you for joining the call today. I'm excited to be at Avon and to be part of
the team. I've learned an enormous amount in a very short period of time, and everything I've learned so far validates
my reason for joining.
I joined Avon knowing full well that this is a business facing some challenges. But I also came here believing there is a
real opportunity to create value for shareholders, which I know is a view that is shared by Sheri, the management team
and our board.
From day one, I've been struck by the high engagement of the management team, and the strong commitment that our
employees have in helping us return Avon back to a position where we can achieve long-term, sustainable top-line
growth, high-quality earnings and improved free cash flow.
In terms of my remarks for today, I'm going to start with the review of Q1 results. I will give you my top line
observations about the quarter, as well as brief commentary about each region. However, I will not be walking through
all the country details for each region since these are available in the MD&A session of our 10-Q. This will leave time
for me to share with you some of the areas I'll be focusing on in the first several months [indiscernible] (14:32).
With that, Q1 results were in line with our expectations on constant dollar revenues. We continued to experience
improvement in underlying constant dollar sales and are seeing a trend improvement in Active Representatives, which
declined only slightly this quarter.
Operating margin came in better than we expected despite the negative currency impact as we continued to make
progress on cost reduction. Moving to more specifics, constant dollar revenue grew 1% but declined 18% on a reported
basis due to foreign exchange. Constant dollar Beauty sales were up 3%, while Fashion & Home was down 3%. Within
Beauty, all three subcategories of Fragrance, Skincare and Color posted growth led by Fragrances which were aided by

the Coty alliance in Brazil.
We saw a recovery in Active Representatives, which were down only 1% despite the negative impact of North America
and continued disruption in markets experiencing high inflation, mainly Venezuela and Argentina. This 1% decline is a
sequential improvement from the previous six quarters. The improvement was largely driven by EMEA, primarily
Russia. Average order growth more than offset the decline in Active Representatives, driven by inflationary pricing,
primarily in Latin America.
Units declined 2%, which is also a sequential improvement, and was driven by strength in EMEA where we continued
to post strong performance. Adjusted gross margin declined 10 basis points to 61.4%. Foreign currency negatively
impacted gross margin by approximately 220 basis points, primarily in EMEA. This was largely offset by lower supply
chain costs and benefits from price mix.
Adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points to 5.7%. The decline was primarily due to foreign currency, which
had an approximate 450-basis-point drag on adjusted operating margin. Constant dollar operating margin was actually
up by 140 basis points, benefiting from lower supply chain costs and reduced corporate overhead. In addition, we
realized a benefit from the reversal of a long-term incentive compensation accrual in the quarter.
The adjusted effective tax rate was 68%. This is a result of the valuation allowance which we established in Q4 and as
the team noted last quarter, was driven by the strengthening U.S. dollar. This resulted in our expected foreign sourced
income shrinking to a magnitude that was no longer sufficient to offset the U.S.-based losses caused primarily by our
corporate expenses and interest on our debt. As a result, we can no longer establish deferred tax assets associated with
our current period U.S.-based loss.
This inability to build further foreign tax credit resulted in an approximately 22-point increase in our effective tax rate
in Q1, or an estimated $0.03 per share. This will cause our effective tax rate to remain volatile in the future periods.
Going forward, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to remain in the high 50%s.
Adjusted EPS was $0.04 per share compared with $0.12 a year ago. Currency had a significant negative impact on a
year-over-year comparison of EPS of approximately $0.21 per share with $0.13 from translation, $0.07 from
transaction and $0.01 from the revaluation of our foreign currency-denominated working capital balances. In addition,
as I just mentioned, our tax rate negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share.
I will now provide more details on our results by region starting with Latin America. Q1 revenue rose 3% in constant
dollars. There were no significant VAT adjustment this quarter, but we did have a benefit last year, which is hurting the
comparison by approximately 1 point. Active Representatives were down 2% and units were down 3%, primarily
driven by continued significant declines in our higher inflationary markets, Venezuela and Argentina. Average order
was up 5% driven by pricing in inflationary markets.
Latin America adjusted operating margin was 7.9%, down 30 basis points. The margin decline was driven by currency
translation.
In constant dollars, adjusted operating margin grew 130 basis points as a result of price/mix, supply chain savings and
the lower bad debt in Brazil. These items were partially offset by higher advertising in Brazil in support of new
products and the comparison against Q1 2014, which included a benefit from the Brazil VAT.
Turning to Brazil, constant dollar revenue was flat. Last year's result benefited approximately 2 points from the VAT
tax credit, which did not repeat this quarter. The environment in Brazil remains challenging from an economic and
competitive perspective, but our core business is stable and we are starting to see some benefits from Coty.
As you know, we launched two Coty fragrances in Q4 and we added three additional fragrances in Q1; David
Beckham, Beyoncé and JLo. These are performing well and are contributing to healthy growth in the Fragrance
category in Brazil.
In addition, as Sheri indicated, we are launching KORRES in May in Brazil and we are very excited about the higher
end positioning in incremental earnings opportunity we'll be offering our top selling representatives.

The biggest challenge for our Brazilian business for the remainder of the year will be the upcoming IPI tax that you are
all aware of. We have been doing extensive work on this. The tax impacts approximately 40% of our sales base in
Brazil. We are taking incremental price increases; however as you know, the consumer environment is difficult in
Brazil and so we will be careful about our pricing strategies.
Based on what we know today, we expect the IPI tax to have an estimated 50-basis-point impact on our total company
constant dollar adjusted operating margin for the full year 2015. I will talk more about this in my outlook later.
In Mexico, revenue was down slightly in constant dollars. While Active Representatives grew, average orders declined
due to some softness in Fashion & Home. Nonetheless, we are pleased that the team in Mexico has stemmed the
decline in Active Representatives this quarter.
Moving to EMEA. Revenue remained strong, rising 9% in constant dollars, as the region continues to benefit from
strong underlying fundamentals with healthy Active Representative growth in units. While our growth is strong, our
adjusted operating margin in EMEA was 8%, down 260 basis points, driven by currency, both translation and
transaction. In constant dollars, adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points as we were able to offset the
approximate 400 basis points of transaction cost, primarily due to revenue leverage.
In Russia, constant dollar revenue rose 26%, driven by Active Representative growth. I would also note that we have
not taken significant price increases to help offset recent currency devaluation. We will be taking some price increases
in Q2, and this is likely to somewhat temper our rate of growth. Additionally, to a lesser extent, we saw a benefit in Q1
due to timing issues that were discussed in recent calls.
We expect the business to slow to a more normalized growth rate in the mid-single digits in the second half as its
comparisons become more difficult given that the recovery in the business began in Q3 of last year. I will talk about the
currency issues impacting Russia in a moment.
The UK business is continuing the trend of recent quarters with continued growth as constant dollar revenue was up 1%
in Q1. This quarter's results were once again driven by growth in average order, partially offset by a decline in Active
Representatives.
Having said that, currency remains a key challenge, most notably in Russia, and we continue to expect it to have a
significant negative impact on our EMEA operating profit in 2015. We are working to mitigate the impact with pricing,
while balancing the focus on keeping our representatives and consumers engaged during these challenging times.
Note that you will likely see an even greater year-over-year decline in the EMEA margin in Q2 as the current weakness
in currency flows through the margin but the pricing takes longer to [indiscernible] (24:28).
Turning to North America. Constant dollar revenue was down 17%. This was in line with our expectations and was
modestly impacted by the shift of the President's Club cycle forward into the fourth quarter from Q1, which was
discussed previously with you.
If we normalize for this change, Q4 and Q1 declines would have been similar. Active Representatives declined 17%.
Adjusted North American operating margin was negative 3%, down 200 basis points from the prior year. This was a
result of the deleverage due to the declining sales on our fixed expense base as the first quarter is always a small quarter
in North America.
In addition, we had higher advertising spending in the quarter in support of regeneration in recruitment as well as
product and brand support. As we look ahead to 2015 for North America, we continue to expect the region to be
profitable.
In Asia Pacific, revenue rose 2% on a constant dollar basis. Active Representatives declined 2%, more than offset by
average order growth. Constant dollar revenue benefited from continued growth in the Philippines of 7%, primarily due
to higher average order. Adjusted operating margin was 10.1%, up 530 basis points. This was due to the benefits from
cost saving initiatives.

Please see our press release and 10-Q for further discussion of the three adjustments we made to our GAAP results in
the quarter, namely Venezuela devaluation, cost implement restructuring and a deferred taxes valuation allowance.
Moving on to cash flow. Net cash used by operating activities was $198 million for the quarter compared with net cash
used of $113 million last year. Operating activities used $85 million more than the prior year, primarily due to the $67
million payment to the SEC in connection with the FCPA settlement.
In Q1, we continued to make progress on working capital, which improved 11 days operationally compared with a year
ago. Accounts payable improved 14 days operationally as we continue to focus on renegotiating payment terms with
our vendors. However, inventory was five days worse operationally, largely driven by Latin America due to upcoming
new product launches including Coty and KORRES.
I also wanted to mention that we have successfully launched a refinancing of our revolving credit facility. The new
facility matures in April 2020, which is extended from March 2017, and has increased flexibility in its financial
covenants. The new credit facility has been successfully syndicated and the lead arrangers have received aggregate
commitments of $400 million in the syndication. The closing of the revolver is subject to the execution of definitive
documentation and other customary closing conditions. This transaction is an important part of the company's ongoing
plan to proactively manage its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure [indiscernible] (27:53) flexibility.
Moving to the outlook for the year. Let me first talk about our expectations excluding the IPI tax in Brazil. Excluding
this, we are very close to where the team told you we would be on the last call. Mainly, we expect modest growth in
both constant dollar sales and constant dollar operating margin. However, given the deterioration of several major
currencies throughout Q1, including the Brazilian real, we now expect currency to have a 17-point negative impact on
reported sales for the year rather than the 12-point impact the team originally estimated in February. This assumed spot
rates at the end of March.
This recent currency deterioration is expected to impact our adjusted operating margin by an incremental 50 basis
points due to foreign currency translation as we plan to be able to offset the additional foreign currency transaction
costs.
Moving to IPI. As I mentioned earlier, our best estimate is that the tax will have an approximate 50-basis-point
negative impact on our constant dollar adjusted operating margin. As a result, we now expect our F dollar operating
margin to be down approximately 200 basis points for the year, which now includes our best estimates of the impact of
the IPI tax as well as the incremental foreign exchange impact.
Also note that we expect the most significant year-over-year declines in adjusted operating margin in Q2 and Q3 partly
due to the currency devaluations. In addition, in Q2, the IPI tax starts to flow through the P&L and we start to
anniversary some of the significant cost-saving benefits.
In terms of our outlook for free cash flow, we now expect approximately $100 million for the year. This is down a bit
from our prior forecast due to lower net income resulting from the IPI tax and the negative impact of currency.
So, that's where we are today. Despite having been at Avon for only two months, I am certain to get a good sense of the
strengths and opportunities, as well as some of the key challenges we face. Given some of these challenges, coupled
with my recent arrival, Sheri and I are working with the senior management team to conduct an assessment of our
business.
Based on what I know today, we are prioritizing the work we are doing on the following four areas. First, growth. I'm
focused on understanding the organic and non-organic growth levers we have. We are looking at our geographic
portfolio with an eye toward keeping our investments focused on the areas with the best potential growth. We're also
looking – continuing to look at our business objectively as we need to ensure that all markets are contributing to the
portfolio and are receiving the appropriate level of investment and this includes North America.
Second, reinvestment. We need to take a balanced approach between finding incremental cost savings and investing for
growth. Having said that, we need to be more disciplined in how we approach return on investment as we think about
potential reinvestment to drive growth. This is true as it relates to capital spend, as well as expense. We will be tackling

a further review of our cost structure starting with what cost we need to run the business rather than what cost we
currently have in place. While the team has done a good job at eliminating cost, I believe there may be additional
opportunity to right size the business for the future. Third is capital structure. I am undergoing a detailed review of our
capital structure, which includes capital allocation, balance sheet flexibility, and capital expenditures. The new revolver
is the first step in this process.
And last, global footprint. I'm convinced that our global footprint is a long-term strategic advantage. However, the
foreign exchange headwinds serve as opportunities to improve our business model, which can position us even better
for the long term.
It is evident to me in my short time here that Sheri, our management team, and our Board of Directors are highly
focused on maximizing long-term value for shareholders, and I'm excited to participate and contribute towards that
ultimate goal.
Put simply, Avon has unique attributes that, when properly harnessed, offer opportunity for significant shareholder
value creation. I'm continuing with my learning at an intense pace. And you should know that as a team, where we see
opportunities, we will not be waiting to take action. I'm looking forward to providing you with a full report at our
Investor Day in the fall. In the meantime, Sheri and I are committed to communicating clearly to our investors as we
make progress along the way.
With that, I'll hand it back to Sheri.

Thanks, Jim. As you heard in his remarks, Jim has a hefty workload. It is ramping up quickly, and I'm very happy to
have him on the team. A top priority for Jim was to address the credit facility, and I'm pleased that he's moved that
forward so quickly.
Before we turn to Q&A, I want to make one additional comment. As most of you are aware, Susan Kropf is set to join
the Avon board after voting is complete at our May 6 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Those of you who followed Avon
over the years will be familiar with Susan. She's both a seasoned public company director and has excellent knowledge
of Avon. I've spoken with Susan periodically during my tenure as CEO, and I think she'll be a terrific addition to the
board. With that, we'll open the line for Q&A.

<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning, it's Deutsche Bank. Hey, I'm trying to sneak into, if I can, the first one
is on the U.S. I know there's tons of strategy and change fatigue but it doesn't seem like the turnaround's really working.
I know you said you still think it's going to be profitable for the year. But the problem may be fundamentally just the
product lineup. So, how much work have you done on the portfolio and sort of the demand and the price point and
things like that? Because I know it had to be sort of focused on cost because the business was declining pretty rapidly.
But maybe, is there a fundamental problem with just the portfolio and how much time will that take to kind of fix and
turn around?

And then on the second question, the IPI tax obviously in Brazil, is it impacting all your competitors equally or will
some be less impacted than others? Thanks so much.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. So, first of all, Bill, thanks for your question. On the U.S., certainly, our focus has
been on improving Active Representative growth because we need to make sure that we're continuing to drive the
overall growth of the business. Product plays an important role in that in making sure that she has the right product
portfolio. We have put a little bit more mind behind product. As Jim mentioned, in the first quarter, we put more mind
behind advertising. I still think there's an opportunity to continue to innovate in the Skincare area and Color, and we'll
continue to do that.
I think the – some of the issues that we're wrestling with are some of the mechanics within the field, but we need to
make sure that we don't take our eye off the ball in terms of making sure that we have the right product innovation and
selling that. And we're really excited as we roll out our new brand positioning to be able to highlight our products,
which I think is also an important thing because what we know is when women try our products, we great reviews. So,
we have an opportunity as we look at the Representative growth piece to make sure that we couple that with our
marketing efforts.
As it relates to your question on IPI tax, one of the things that's interesting, as you look at our business about 40 – as
Jim mentioned, 40% of the volume was impacted. We're leaders in Color as you know in Brazil and also in Skincare
and the tax is more behind. It impacts that part of the business, less so on Fragrance.
So, we index more heavily than some of our competitors because they tend to have – their portfolio is more fragrance
oriented, so it does impact our business more because of our strength in Color and Skincare.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Great. Thanks so much.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thanks Bill.

Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. Good morning. It's Barclays. I was curious about Russia on the commentary
on pricing, that pricing's coming in the second quarter. So, was some of the strength this quarter – are reps aware of that
price increase coming? Was there any kind of buy-ahead that we should be mindful of? So, that was one.
And then also just overall on the consumer. I think so far what we've heard from other companies on the Russian
consumers, they seem to be kind of holding in pretty well in these categories but everyone's sort of braced for that to
change, whether it's because pricing's coming through or just because it feels inevitable. So, if you could comment on
that as well, it'd be great. Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I mean I think there is probably some small stack of people stocking up relative to
pricing. It's hard for us to actually put a measure on that. I'm sure there's a little bit of that. I think one of the things that
the team has done extremely well in Russia is to engage with the Representatives and really get them excited about the
earnings opportunity. So, I'm very pleased with the work that they're doing. And as we've looked at that, particularly as
we looked at that price a year ago, we've made tremendous progress in that area.
We are being thoughtful about how we manage price. It's important for us to take price to balance the margin issues.
But at the same time, we need to be thoughtful. And when we're looking at it, price points, by SKU to make sure that
we understand where we can drive price effectively.
It's going to be one of these things that we're going to stay close to on. It's hard to predict what happens. Right now, our
Russian team is extremely bullish on their performance and is excited about what they're seeing in the field.

All right. Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. With Citigroup. My question has to do with the guidance for the sort of low-single
digit or minimal local currency sales growth this year because if I look at the 1% you put up this quarter, if we back out
Russia, which is expected to slow, you wouldn't have been at that level. So, I guess, my high-level question is, which
markets do you think will improve so that that sort of 1% tight target for the full year is realistic?
And then kind of more broadly, Sheri, you've talked in the past about your frustration about the forecasting ability and
the management team generally and sort of the visibility into the business which I think has plagued Avon for years.
And I'm looking at a market like Mexico where your comments in January were kind of, we have the new management
team. We've cracked the code. The business is better. We're off to the races and yet now we see a setback despite an
easy comp. So, if you can talk about just generally your handle on the business, the visibility into each of the markets
and why we should believe that from a revenue growth perspective, things are actually more tenable or manageable or
that kind of thing. Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. Thanks, Wendy. So, one of the things that I commented on is as I'm looking at the
Active Representative growth and the progression that we're seeing, what we see now is eight of our – or two-thirds of
our top 12 markets are performing well as it relates to Active Representatives. And that's something that we have
confidence that we're going to continue to see as we move forward. So, that's part of why we see – we feel more
confident with the growth agenda.
As it relates to transparency and our ability to forecast, one of the most important things is to make sure that we
understand the source of sales which comes from the Representative account, as well as our product portfolio. And I
am very confident with what we're seeing in Mexico based on the Representative growth piece of that and where
they're trending.
Certainly, we had some softness in Fashion & Home this quarter, but I'm very pleased with what we saw in Beauty.
And so, as a company, we have a geographic portfolio and we're going to see our ups and downs. We're going to have
to manage that like any company. But I feel confident.
Maybe I'll turn it to Jim, and just give your perspective on how you're feeling about [indiscernible] (40:47).
<A - James S. Scully>: [indiscernible] (40:47) this is obviously one of my top priorities. I think it's key to
understanding the business and I think our ability to forecast business highlights our handle on the business. So, I
would say in the early days here, I think there's an opportunity, as we work with the regions, I would say, and the
finance leads. It's something that we talk about often, and we'll continue to make progress on it.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thanks. Thanks, Wendy.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: And – sorry, just as a follow-up, if I'm allowed. Just on the reps, is there something that
you can point to, Sheri, in terms of, I mean, it sounds like in Russia maybe, the rep recruitment was particularly
successful because you lagged pricing maybe that some of your competitors took.
But is there something broadly, like the advertising that increased in the quarter, was that directed more to the reps or
what's helping you with the reps? Because it's great. If the rep growth continues in those key markets, that's awesome,
but I'm questioning whether that's sustainable. Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. Sure. It goes back to the points I've made a few times about the importance of having
the focus on the field and having the right commercial product portfolio. And as we look at the discipline, and as I
mentioned I guess, a couple quarters ago, we've actually put John Higson in place who's actually helping us look at the
sales trends. He's looking at the top markets, and we're making sure people are continuing to stay focused on those
trends.

Where appropriate, we are putting more money behind Representative advertising to generate leads. But I think it's a
message to the organization, the teams have been very focused on making sure we have the field management in place,
as well as the right products to excite people about the opportunity.

And your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. I'm from Bernstein. So, a clarification and a linked question to that. So, you mentioned
$100 million of free cash flow that you expect for the year. And if you project forward based on that, can you give us a
sense of what your debt-to-EBITDA might look like for the end of the year and does that constrain you? Because, I
guess, the bigger question to me is that it seems, whether it be Brazil, whether it be Russia, it just really seems that you
can only grow if you spend back and we see margin compression, so, i.e., you're spending to get back growth. So, do
you think your – do you think you have enough money to spend on the business to really fix it? Some people think
something like $1 billion is what you need to do to sustainably fix the business. So, is there a time that you consider,
that you should consider, eliminating the dividend or issuing stock or some other ways to kind of shore up some
flexibilities that you can invest to get back growth?
<A - James S. Scully>: Well, it's Jim. So, I think there's a number of questions in that, so I'll try to piece it apart. I
think first, one of the first things I did when I got here was to look at the liquidity and the capital structure. And why it
was an important thing for me to do is to get the new revolver in place, which gives us considerably more financial
flexibility as we go forward.
In terms of investment and reinvestment, I think there needs to be a balance struck. And as I highlighted in my prepared
remarks, I think that's part of the work that we're doing now to come back to Investor Day. I would just tell you from
my personal perspective, that balance is a delicate balance. And I need to get further into the business than eight weeks
to see where the growth opportunities are, where the savings opportunities are, and what the ROI characteristics need to
be. But I think that's part of the work that we're going to be doing for the Investor Day this fall.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. So, it's totally fair they may not know that after eight weeks, so I won't push you on it now.
Although a broader perspective from folks who've been there longer might be helpful. And in particular, around one
point, around advertising spend, because it sounds like advertising spend has gone up in this quarter, and your other
question might be around Representatives, certainly as well in Brazil specifically. I'm trying to get a sense of what your
view is about advertising spend also, because Avon sometimes goes not quite guardrail-to-guardrail, but sometimes
believes advertising spend has an ROI and sometimes it believes it doesn't, and it should spend more on the
Representative. And I want to get a sense of what the thinking is at this point inside the company. Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. But just to clarify, the advertising spend in Brazil this quarter was specifically
focused on new product launches. We launched some new color products and we focused on product, and it has strong
ROI.
So, my point of view, particularly as I look at the rollout of our new brand positioning, Beauty for a Purpose. We are
looking at advertising spend. We will direct it. First of all, we have an opportunity to use our six million
Representatives because they are spokespeople for our brand and that's very important to make sure that we give them
the opportunity, both on our product as well as the brand message.
We are looking at how we redeploy some of our resources away from TV advertising to social media, PR, because
what we see is that really does drive product and it drives the Representatives' opportunity. So, when we look at the
spend levels of 2015, we think it will be in line with where we started out, but we are going to continue to look at 2016
to see, is there a way to actually improve the return on investment. We may spend more, we may not. It really depends
on a switch from TV advertising to more social media and PR.
I think it's important to make sure we talk about our products because that's one of the biggest assets we have. We have
terrific products and we have an opportunity to make sure people know that, particularly younger and newer consumers

to get them excited about the Avon brand proposition. So, some of the work that Jim and the management team are
doing around growth and reinvestment will be looking at that more holistically to see if there's ways that we can drive
that further. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Olivia Tong. Please state your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Great. Thanks. Bank of America Merrill Lynch. First, can you just update us on what the new
covenant restrictions are and sort of go through what's going to drive that driving improvement in cash flow as the year
progresses?
And then just to follow up, on price/mix, just specifically for the quarter, it did decelerate overall and particularly for
the markets with the biggest FX pressure, Latin America and EMEA. And I would have expected that to [indiscernible]
(47:17) stay at flat sequentially, if not increase. So, I know you talked about Russia, but what about some of the other
big markets where you saw pretty big FX moves like Brazil? Thanks.
<A - James S. Scully>: I'll take the bank deal to start with. I think, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are in the process
of going through the closing. It'll be over the next 30 days. At that time, the covenants will be made public when we
file it. But just rest assured that obviously, we've given an update on current business. So, we feel comfortable with
where they [indiscernible] (47:48).

Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yes. Good morning. It's Stifel. I wanted first to follow up on Olivia's question on pricing,
just sort of broadly. I thought it was supposed to pick up to offset currency, and it obviously slowed relative to 4Q. So,
I was sort of wondering how you're thinking about that, whether there's been a bit of a change on the volume price
dynamic.
And more specifically within Brazil, I understand your comments on IPI, but you do have competitors obviously that
sell skincare and color. So sort of relative to those competitors, are you choosing to absorb more of the IPI impact then
taking pricing to offset it or maybe just some sort of color around that would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. Just, I will talk about the IPI and pricing mix challenge in Brazil. So, one of the
things that we are trying to balance is to make sure that we're managing margin but at the same time, we know in Brazil
that the consumer confidence is weak.
And so, we're looking at it. Instead of taking price all at once, we're looking at staging that. That will impact us a bit in
terms of not seeing that improvement in price/mix right away, but we think it's important to make sure that we keep the
consumer and represented engaged in the business. So, we'll be monitoring that as we go. I think there's an opportunity
in some of our markets to continue to take price, but we're also trying to make sure that we have that appropriate
balance. And so, that's some of what I think you're seeing flow through.

Your next question comes from Steve Powers. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Hi. It's UBS. Hi, Sheri. Hi, Jim. So, Jim, I guess the $100 million in free cash flow this year is
only $0.20, $0.25 a share. So, how do you realistically improve that and how quickly? And I ask that in the context of
the earlier questions around investment needs because even looking beyond the income statement, we've seen pullbacks

in CapEx as a percentage of sales every year since 2010. And it looks like 2015 is off to a similar start. So, at what
point beyond advertising, in fact, do you have to get more proactive from a CapEx cycle standpoint?
<A - James S. Scully>: Why I think a couple things. I want to go back to, there's a lot of works that needs to get done
to answer the question. But I would start with, improving cash flow comes through a number of ways, right? So, there's
a balance in terms of CapEx and also on the cost side in terms of driving, first of all, increased profitability which
would flow through to cash. I also think there's an opportunity in working capital that we're evaluating now. I think
there's been a lot of talk around inventory levels externally. There's plenty that I've seen have been coming over the
first eight weeks and it's a high priority for me. I think there's some potential supply chain initiatives that we've looked
at in the past that could be an opportunity. Instead of looking at finished goods further in the supply chain to raw
materials, things that we could do there. That's a huge part of the works that I'm undertaking now as we look at the cost
and investment side. I think those types of things could potentially drive free cash flow in the future.

Your next question comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Consumer Edge Research. Good morning, everyone. I would like to go to the point that you
refer as the mechanics of the field. Could you tell us three years into it, what exactly you tried to accomplish in the U.S.
when you brought an executive from Tupperware to manage the field? So, what went wrong? And whether you have
visibility of the raw size of your sales force because when you reported rep activity and is rep engagement, but I would
imagine that after three years of double-digit decline, the sales force could be much smaller. So, if you can tell us how
much smaller the sales force in the U.S. actually is.
And the same thing in Russia, could you tell us to what extent what the mistakes that happens in the U.S., to what
extent they inform what you are doing in Russia? And how sustainable that is because we had seen recruitment going
sour. What kind of inducement you created in Russia so that you had this spike in rep activity or engagement? Thank
you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: So, it's important to drive Representative growth globally. What's critically important is to
bring Representatives in, on-board them, make sure that we support them as they come in because what we know is if
they come in and stay with us for about six campaigns, they tend to stay with us. So, Russia has put in a terrific
Representative recruiting program and retention program, as have many of our other markets.
I was going to say that Russia and the U.S. are in very different places. U.S. certainly has different macro issues, and it
has different internal issues that we've struggled with over the years. So, I wouldn't compare what we're doing in Russia
per se, other than on the broadest basis in terms of how you go about recruiting and retention. That's consistent. But
we're up against very different environment.
So, from that standpoint, I think the most important thing from our organization is to make sure that we have the right
people in place, that they continue to focus on making sure we get the products in the hands of our Representatives, and
we support our Representatives so that they have good earnings opportunity.

Your next question comes from Nik Modi. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yeah. RBC Capital Markets. So, Sheri, I was hoping you can just provide some context on the rep
turnover, rep churn, and how you see that metric today maybe even versus your peers, if you can share some context on
that. And then what can you do now and how much you think it could potentially cost to really kind of get rep churn to
moderate, if you can have a little bit more operating leverage in the business over time as those reps continue to sell
more and more every year.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Are you specifically speaking to the U.S. market? Because from a total...
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yes and...
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: ...from a total...
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: If you could just kind of take us through unfamiliar bigger markets, that would be helpful because
I know it may not just be a U.S.-based issue.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, 8 of our top 12 markets are in growth mode relative to Active Reps so they're
bringing people in and we're seeing good retention. In the markets where we've had more challenge, we are focused on
the recruiting component as well as retention. The retention piece, it's important to make sure that they have the
earnings opportunity, that they feel that they're successful in selling and making sure that they have great products that
they can bring to their customers.
And so we do monitor that. We look at both the number of people we bring in as well as the retention aspects. And so
we continue to track that on a regular basis. We can see that for all of our top 12 markets, and I'm pleased with the
majority of the markets on that front.

And your final question will come from the line of Steph Wissink. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Stephanie Schiller Wissink>: Thank you. Piper Jaffray. Good morning, everyone. Sheri, just wondering if you
can talk a little bit about the competitive landscape globally, not necessarily from other direct selling models or
opportunities for your reps, but just the relevance of the direct selling proposition in the beauty industry as we see
evolution in terms of the domains in which people are shopping. If you could just talk about that, it would be helpful.
Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. Well, just a broad statement. If we look at direct selling, I mean, the idea of women
selling to their social circles is still very relevant today and perhaps, in the future, will be even more relevant because
people are constantly looking for advice from friends, particularly as it relates to beauty.
If we look at the broader geographic portfolio, we see different markets in different places. So, as an example, in
Brazil, we see the majority of Skincare and Color products and Fragrance products going through direct selling still
today and very competitive direct selling environment. In other markets, you see the increase of retail and so you have
that as a competitive set. So, it really does vary by market. I think the most important thing is to make sure we have
competitive products and we have this competitive earnings opportunity for our Representatives.
