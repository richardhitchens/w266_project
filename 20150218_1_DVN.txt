our earnings release. I hope you've all had a chance to review those documents, as today's call will largely consist of
Q&A.
Finally, I'd remind you that comments and answers to questions on this call will contain plans, forecasts, expectations
and estimates, which are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. These comments and answers are
subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements
are not guarantees of future performance. For a review of risk factors relating to these estimates, see our Form 10-K
and subsequent 10-Qs.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels.
John Richels
Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. You have a lot of detail in
the operations report that was posted last night. We sure hope that you like that new disclosure and you find the report
very helpful as you work your way through the information.
Just before we jump into Q&A, I'd just like to make a couple of points. The past year was an important, really
transformational, year for Devon and the company delivered what we think were some outstanding results in 2014. As
we discuss our 2014 results today and our outlook for 2015, I hope you come away with three important messages.
First, the dramatic portfolio transformation that we accomplished in 2014 has resulted in Devon having a top tier asset
portfolio with a deep inventory of high rate of return investment opportunities and years of running room.
Secondly, we're approaching 2015 with caution and with a view to maintaining flexibility given the challenging
business environment. With that in mind, we are laser focused on execution, which is allowing us to decrease E&P
capital spending by roughly 20% in 2015 without any reduction in our previous total production growth guidance or
our previous guidance of 20% to 25% oil production growth. And lastly, we have a terrific balance sheet that continues
to be one of the strongest in the E&P sector and we have a very strong hedge position, ample liquidity and a number of
other financial levers that give us superior financial strength and flexibility in the current business environment. So in
spite of the challenging macro environment we think we are very well poised to deliver superior returns for our
shareholders in the upcoming years.
Again, thank you for joining us, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Howard to start the Q&A. Howard?
Howard J. Thill
Thanks, John. Before we start, I'd ask you to make certain that we can get as many people as possible on the call, that
you limit yourself to two questions. And you can re-prompt to ask additional questions as time may permit.
So, Courtney, with that, we're ready to take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And, John and Dave, congratulations on your respective
changes in roles as we move through this year. If I may take two questions, first of all, on the increase in the type curve
on the Eagle Ford, I guess I was look for some incremental disclosure on the rest of the Eagle Ford position, Lavaca,
the upper Eagle Ford inventory potential. Because the reserve life there, rather the drilling life is still relatively short
and in the current oil price environment, I'm just curious as to how do you think about that inventory as we go forward?

And I've got a quick follow-up, please.
<A - David A. Hager>: Hi, Doug. This is Dave. Well, we're very encouraged with what we're seeing obviously in the
Eagle Ford. We upped the type curve due to the results that we've had with our optimized completions. We also – the
production optimization specifically the choke management have yielded outstanding results and you can see
highlighted some increase in the type curve and in a few incredibly great wells, greater than 3,000 Boe per day on a
30-day IP. We have decreased the drilling activity somewhat in the – or the rig activity somewhat in the Eagle Ford.
We've dropped down. We were thinking we were going to go from around 15 to 16 rigs. We're down around 10 rigs in
DeWitt County. And then we'll be drilling some wells in Lavaca County this year. And we'll also continue appraising
the upper Eagle Ford. We're very encouraged with the earlier results that we see in the upper Eagle Ford thus far at this
point. Lavaca County is still a part of the overall program. I have talked about previously how it's a little bit thinner
over there. You don't get quite the rates in the EURs you do in the other and given the current commodity price
environment, we think it's prudent to focus our activity in DeWitt County. But we have a strategy for holding on to the
Lavaca County acreage. And that will be part of our go-forward program when commodity prices recover somewhat.
So we still have Lavaca, it is there.
The DeWitt County and the lower Eagle Ford just keeps getting better. And we still don't have the results from the
Devon completions that we did here starting coming on-line here at the first of the year. But these are from the revised
BHP completions. We think took us about 80% away to where we want to go with the completions signed. And that's
getting significantly better. And the early results on the upper Eagle Ford are encouraging. We just need to get more
appraisal activity. So I think overall, it's positive. There are – with the lower drilling activity and with the upper Eagle
Ford potential there, there is potential for linking the inventory that we have.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Appreciate the answers, Dave. Hopefully, my second question is a little quicker. Obviously,
there's a lot of debate over how quickly and what scale of cost reduction the industry can expect in this lowered oil
price environment. So if you can give us Devon's perspective, please, in terms of what have you assumed in your
capital budget by way of cost reduction and ultimately where do you think it can get to by year-end as opposed to the
average for the year. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
<A - David A. Hager>: Hi, Doug. Your question was quick on the first one. My answer was long. So it wasn't your
fault. But I'm going to turn over to Darryl Smette and he's going to talk a little bit about the cost reduction.
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Yes, Doug. Just trying to set the basis here, what I'm going to do is give you some numbers,
and they're going to be in relationship to the cost environment we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014. So what we have
seen so far is a cost reduction on different phases of our CapEx, from drilling rigs to drill bits to OTG, those types of
things, of about 10% compared to the fourth quarter. We are still in meaningful discussions with all of our equipment
and service providers. We have high hopes that we will continue to drive additional costs out of that system. Right
now, we are hoping that we could get an additional 10% to 15% by year-end. What we have currently in our budget is a
10% reduction from fourth quarter, and that does not include any efficiencies that we might gauge from our operational
people. That is just price related to our service providers.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So 25% would be the total [indiscernible] (9:10) clear.
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: That would be a comparison of fourth quarter 2014 versus fourth quarter 2015.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great. That's really helpful. Thanks, everybody.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
<Q - Subash Chandra>: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. First question is on the uncompleted inventory. How do you
see that exiting 2015 versus 2014?

<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, this is Dave again. Talking specifically in the Eagle Ford, we had about 150 wells that
were not completed at the end of 2014. We have decreased our completion crews out there. We did have nine crews
working at one point. We had started five. We added four more, two of which were Devon-operated. We've gone from
nine down to four at this point, three of which are BHP-operated, one of which is Devon-operated. The Devon-operated
crew is also in DeWitt County. We're going to do a few more wells there, and then we're going to move it to Lavaca
County, and then after that, we'll be dropping that completion crew also. Having said all that, we do anticipate the
uncompleted inventory in the Eagle Ford to basically halve by the end of the year. So somewhere on the order of 70, 75
uncompleted wells there.
The other key area I'd say that we have an uncompleted inventory is in the Delaware Basin and the Permian Basin
overall. We have about 55 or so wells in the Permian Basin. I think about 35 in the Delaware Basin that are
uncompleted, and that's going be part of the basis of our growth as we move into 2015 as we drive that inventory down
to probably more on the order of 20 to 25 uncompleted wells by the end of 2015. So we're taking a measured approach
at this in light of the current price environment, but we will be driving the inventory down.
<Q - Subash Chandra>: Okay. That was good. Thanks. And follow-up, I guess I'll wait for some details in the K, but
any sort of flavor you can add for the 2014 reserves sort of where the hits and misses or the highs and lows were as far
as reserve credit you may or may not have gotten?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: You want to take a shot, John? I'll add to it.
<A - John Richels>: Sure. Subash, if you look at our 2014, I mean some of the big pieces and you're right, you'll be
able to get a lot more detail, but some of the highlights of that, I guess, were – was the light oil reserve additions were
very, very strong. We actually added about 200% of our light oil – 2014 light oil production. To the extent there were
some downward revisions, they were largely gas as a result of the five-year rule, if my memory serves me correct, but I
think it's 74 million barrels were related to that. So they're just off because we're not developing that gas right now, and
it'll come back at the right time.
Dave, do you have anything to add to that?
<A - David A. Hager>: I think that's the key. We had extensions, discoveries around 200 million barrels or so. We
purchased of about 265 million barrels. We had revisions other than price of negative 65 million, and that was
essentially – all of that and a little more was due to the five-year rule. So that's the key highlight. So we think when we
put it all together from an all-in F&D standpoint or drill bit F&D, we had very competitive metrics.
<Q - Subash Chandra>: Yes. I guess I was sort of looking at it in context of what you'd spent in 2014 versus 2013. It
looked to be a bit more and with revisions, or say even without revisions looked to be about the same as the prior year?
If there was any read through in that?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, the one thing you have to keep in mind in general when you're thinking about F&D is
that as we shift to oil, the F&D may be a little bit higher but it's still has the value equation, makes it more than
worthwhile. You still are – from a returns standpoint, you still get much higher returns. But as you make the shift like
we have to oil, oil F&D tends to be a little bit higher.
<Q - Subash Chandra>: Okay. That helps. Thank you.
<A - John Richels>: And as we've said, Subash, the bulk of that or a big piece of that reserve addition was on the light
oil side which is our highest margin product as well.
<Q - Subash Chandra>: Right. Okay. That would explain it. Okay. Thanks so much.

<Q - David R. Tameron>: Hi. Good morning. And echo my congrats on the management changes. If I think about the
ability to ramp in the second half of the year and how you guys look at the price sensitivity and I assume like every
other E&P company you've run, 10, 15 different scenarios since October, November, but how should we think about if
oil climbs back to 65, what's that look like? Can you just give some general framework and thoughts around that?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, this is Dave again. While there are a lot of variables that go into that equation and we're
going to give you a fairly non-specific answer here because of that, but we have to look at also what is the cost
environment if oil does go back. We have to look at what returns we're getting in each of those plays, what the
takeaway capacity is, what the drilling results are, et cetera. So there's – it's hard to be too specific on that.
I'd say the key thing is we have a lot of flexibility both to take capital down or to take capital back up. The vast
majority of our rigs are on a well-to-well basis. We have very few on long-term contract. Almost all of our acreage is
held by production. So there's no concern with drilling wells just to retain acreage. So we have all the flexibility. So
we'll assess that situation if that were to occur, and make the right call. Understanding our – we are looking at first the
returns at a well level, and then second what's our balance sheet look like.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Okay. One follow-up on that. If I think about 2016, let's say, and I know it's a long ways
out, but if I think about oil where it's at and let's say you get those 25% reductions on the service side that you're
targeting by 4Q. Does that set up a scenario where 2016 – I guess with that type of scenario where margins come in
such that 2016 looks similar to what you would have done in 2013, 2014 just at a lower price band? That makes sense?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, I understand what you're trying to describe there, David. Well, it's possible. That's true.
From – I think in that scenario and again there's a lot of variables go in there. So it's hard to say for sure but I think you
could paint a scenario where you could be getting similar type returns to what you're talking about in 2013, 2014. You
would have to also then consider though the cash flow for the company. And do you – and the desire that we want to
stay with a strong balance sheet. So obviously the 65 to 70, you would have lower cash flow than you would have had
at $90 a barrel. Having said that, we're also looking at in addition to what we've talked about, we have a lot of
productivity gains that we've been able to get here through the improved completion design. And so I think at the well
level, you could paint a scenario where you could have very, very good returns in that kind of price environment. I
think you'd have to look at the overall cash flow for the company and just say how much capital do you want to spend
and maintain a strong balance sheet.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Okay. No, that's helpful. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Bob Alan Brackett>: I have a question about the JVs and how you allocate capital in the Eagle Ford, that BHP
JV. How do you develop that plan? Do they put forward a plan for the number of rigs and you either consent or not
consent or do you do it interactively?
<A - John Richels>: Tony Vaughn, our Head of E&P, is in the room. And we're going to turn the call over to Tony. He
works probably the closest of any of us with BHP and we'll have him answer that.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Hi, Bob. This is Tony. Appreciate your question. And we do work very closely with BHP.
We actually have some of our engineers esconded into the BHP office, so it's a very close working relationship. As you
know, we were running about 15 rigs in DeWitt County. Three in our Lavaca County work. We jointly decided to
reduce activity on DeWitt side of business back to 10. It affords us the opportunity to actually high-grade the
completions and you can see that the type curve was increased from about 1,200 Boe up to 1,600 Boe, 1,650 Boes per
day, but the average for the last quarter was all the way up to about 2,100 Boes per day. So it's really a joint effort. We
have a concept of working in a project team environment between the two companies and a lot of synergies there, bring
all of our technical skills to the table and we just jointly work that process.

<Q - Bob Alan Brackett>: Okay. And then a similar JV question, in this lime, it looks like you still have some money
left on the carry. Why not go ahead and use up that carry since you get 70%?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, that carry is fungible, so we can move it – if you remember, the original was set up in
five different plays and we can use that carry up in the Rockies as well and that's our intention is to use the rest of it.
The JV money – the Sinopec is in the Turner and the LOE, but they're in the Parkman. But we'll be drawing some
Turner wells and that will use up that remaining JV carry and we think that's the most efficient place to do it.
<Q - Bob Alan Brackett>: Got you. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Yes, good morning, everyone. I'm wondering...
<A - John Richels>: Good morning, Charles.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: On the NGL front, the guidance you guys gave for pricing surprised me a little bit. And I'm
wondering, from your vantage point as both a producer but also operating EnLink, if you could talk about how you see
that market evolving over the course of the year?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Yeah, this is Darryl. Obviously, NGL prices have really taken a hit. Starting a couple years
ago but just in the last three or four months that has deteriorated even further. There's a couple things at work there.
First of all, we've had because of the success the industry has had, we've had a tremendous amount of new NGLs which
come on the market. And that is including virtually all the products but primarily ethane and propane. Over the last few
months, what you have seen is a deterioration in the propane price and that has been caused by a couple of different
things. Number one, the increase in supply but in the middle part of 2014 and early in 2014, we were able to export a
large portion of that propane internationally.
Because of the downturn in the economies and the low crude oil prices now, the crude oil Napa price is able to compete
internationally with propane. And so the propane price internationally plus the cost does not make that a good
exportable product right now. So that has really backed up propane and caused a large growth in storage. As we go
forward, we don't see – and let me just add to that what we've had is a very mild winter in some parts of the country,
especially early on in November and December. And so there was on the propane side a number of demand scenarios
that didn't play out because of that warm weather.
As we move through the year, it's going to take a while to work off that propane supply. So while we might see some
improvement, we have seen some improvement in the last 30 days or so. We still think that propane is going be under
pressure. We do think ethane will continue to be under pressure simply because of all the ethane that is out there. We
do not think ethane will start trading above the Btu equivalent of gas until we get into the late 2016, maybe early 2017
as additional pet chem plants come on stream. Even though there are some export facilities that will be available, at
least on the water coming in the next year or two, in the current environment, we don't see that helping a whole lot. So
we think ethane is going to continue to be under pressure for the next year and a half or so and we think propane, as we
go through the summer months, may improve but at least in the near term that doesn't give us much hope either.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Got it. That's a lot of great detail and I'm sure some of the people on the call up in the
Northeast are wondering about that mild winter you're talking about but...
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Yes.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: ...on a different front, your thermal oil in Canada, can you talk a bit about how that asset – I
know the operational performance looks great. But wondering if you could talk in a more broad sense how that asset
looks in your portfolio now and if you – how it compares to your light tight opportunities and particularly with
outperformance, but also I know there's a different tax regime up there and all that sort of thing.

<A - John Richels>: Charles, when you look at the – we've got the production continuing to ramp up in Canada, as you
know, from Jackfish 3 and we actually have another pad coming on at Jackfish 2 which will help to ramp that
production up through the end of 2015 and through all of 2016. We're not making a lot of capital expenditures and
undertaking a lot of capital expenditures in Canada in that heavy oil business today. And this was a business that we
always thought you have to take a long-term view on it, and you have to be in one of the best projects. And we're in an
area with Jackfish and Pike, frankly, our neighbors there are Cenovus's Christina Lake and MEG and we're in really
what appears to be the sweet spot for oil sands development in Canada. So we're not expending a lot in terms of
additional CapEx right now.
The returns from that over the last year have always been cash flow positive even – we're cash flow positive even at a
$40 or $45 WTI because we are in one of the very best projects and the returns over the last year have ranged from
some of the lower values with the $45 WTI to very high returns when oil was trading at $100 and the differential was
$14. So it's something that you have to take bit of a long-term view on, but it still provides at the WTI prices where
they are today a pretty good rate of return on a cash going forward basis.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Got it. Thank you for that. Thank you for those thoughts, John.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: On the cost front, your guidance for both lease operating expense and SG&A costs per Boe
appears to be rising a bit in 2015 relative to 2014. Can you talk to what's driving this, and if you see or have baked in
cost deflation opportunities?
<A - John Richels>: I may start off on the LOE side here briefly and then hand it over to Tom Mitchell to talk about
on the G&A side. On the LOE side, the increase is primarily driven just as we continue to shift our portfolio to an
oil-oriented portfolio versus a gas-oriented portfolio, and so if you remember, in part of 2014, we still had the
conventional gas assets and the Canada as well as the non-core gas assets in the U.S. And so they contributed to the
overall number for 2014. So it's just a shift to the portfolio. But in a normalized price environment, you're still
increasing margins significantly as you move to this oil-oriented portfolio. But that's the only thing on the LOE side. I
think Tom can give you a little more specifics probably on that and then also on the G&A side.
<A - Thomas L. Mitchell>: Yes, Brian, on G&A, first of all, you've got to remember that the reported volumes are
down year-on-year when you take out the non-core assets that have been divested. So that's part of it. We do have some
increases. You've got a full year of EnLink in there and EnLink's up a little bit. And in addition to that, and this is really
positive and you're seeing it in our execution, some investment has been made primarily on the technical side that's
going into G&A here back in Oklahoma City and a huge investment really and just execution overall within the
company, and you're seeing it in our results here in the last few quarters, in particular. So those are the primary drivers
behind it.
<A - John Richels>: Brian, one thing I didn't answer is we have not assumed any cost savings on the LOE side. Now,
we are going after those, obviously, but unlike the capital side where Darryl talked about the cost savings, we have not
assumed that in our budget case. Again, we are aggressively pursuing those, but we have not made that assumption.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Okay, great. That's helpful. And my follow-up actually goes a bit back to the prior question
with regards to oil sands. When you think about Pike this is a year, I think, you've said you're going be doing the final
review as you think about potentially looking at it again for sanction next year. But do you see cost deflation
opportunities? And have you locked any in, in terms of Pike or future in situ oil sands? And what pace is that moving at
relative to what you're seeing in onshore U.S.?
<A - John Richels>: Yeah, Brian. You're absolutely right. We are seeing some costs and so what we're doing at Pike
now as we've previously discussed and Dave can maybe give you, if you like, some more detail around the engineering

but we're doing some additional engineering work throughout this year to scope out the project properly. And also at
the same time scoping out costs because that's where you're seeing exactly what you have alluded to. We don't quite
know where those costs are all going to work out throughout the year. But we think we're going to have significant cost
savings going into a decision as to whether we move ahead and when we move ahead with Pike. And that makes – as
you know, that makes a significant difference if we can keep those costs down. We're going to revisit the decision on
Pike after we've done this additional appraisal work and the additional engineering work and have scoped out the costs
more towards year end.
In addition to the cost side, that'll also give us more clarity and some visibility hopefully on FX, which is an important
factor as well, give us more clarity and visibility on commodity prices. And also on differentials because we'll maybe
have a little bit more definition around projects like Keystone XL or TransCanada Energy East, and Alberta Clipper
and Kinder Morgan and the rail capacity, all of those things that go into determining a differential. So we're going to
get a lot more of that information but we are definitely seeing the cost structure come down. Having said that because
we're still working on the final engineering documentation we haven't been locking in costs at this point in time. But
we'll get a lot more clarity on that as we work our way through the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe with TPH. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Rowe>: Hi. I actually wanted to go back to a comment made earlier just about 2016 and kind of your
willingness to outspend cash flow. So I'm just wondering if hedges roll off in 2016 and the current strip price proves to
be accurate, could you maybe talk about the ability of your high rate of return Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin assets to
sustainably grow within cash flow? And if they can't, I mean do you have some level of comfort to outspend cash flow
given your ability to monetize midstream assets to EnLink?
<A - John Richels>: Michael, certainly, the assets that you're talking about, our returns in the Eagle Ford and in the
Permian are very high and could certainly maintain that. But I said in the comments at the beginning, we are in a
terrific position obviously to – depending on our outlook for the future at the time, we're in a terrific position to take
advantage of that because of our strong financial position and because of all of the financial levers that you have talked
about. So our plan is as we kind of look into the future, our plan is to live pretty close to cash flow, but we've got a
whole lot of other financial levers that we can take advantage of if we felt the time was right and the circumstances at
the time were right.
<Q - Michael J. Rowe>: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just the last question, I guess, would be sort of around your
hedging strategy. Just given the high rates of return that you can get in the Eagle Ford as an example even today, do
you have any desire to hedge 2016 at this point? And I guess what are your parameters that you're thinking about
internally before you'd make a decision to actually roll on hedges in 2016? Thank you.
<A - John Richels>: Well, so far, we have – our philosophy generally has been that we try to lock in about 50% or
hedge about 50% of our production. And it's – we do that just as a matter of prudence. Even having a strong balance
sheet and having the financial leverage is just to ensure some level of cash flow every year. So that's our general
philosophy.
Now, we haven't been layering in a lot of hedges for 2016 at these prices because we believe that the price is going to
be higher in 2016. And what we've typically tried to do, although we have swapped some volumes, we typically try to
do it on collars where we can lock in a – or protect the floor price and keep some of the upside as well. But given that
we haven't been layering in the hedges at this price, we're going to have to see a little stronger price, or have a change
of view in the future.
And the other thing that you always have to remember is and we always try to keep in mind is that when we do lock in
the price side that doesn't lock in the cost side and so you're only locking in half the equation. And so we're watching

Your next question comes from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic Global. Your line is open.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to go back to topic actually from a little minute ago
about the NGL pricing. You guys gave some nice color there. Thanks for that. But I wanted to talk about how that
affected your thinking on capital allocation to the Anadarko Basin, Cana especially. Obviously, the NGL Y Grade [ph]
barrels (35:10) are kind of a bigger part of the economic proposition for those wells. How do you think about that? And
then how is that affecting well economics, your generally poor view of the NGL market? I know that you have a bigger
asset there now, so I'm not sure if it's – we should think of the $400 million as an increase in spending, but just any
color you have on that?
<A - John Richels>: Well, we have a very deep inventory of development opportunities that we're pursuing in the
Cana field particularly. Not to mention now the Meramec that is – we've had a couple good wells in the oil section of
the Meramec that we've operated. And then, you can see we're in a number of non-operated Meramec wells that are
oil-oriented in the past year. So that's kind of a separate story, but that's a very positive story as well.
Regarding Cana and the funding of the activity that we're doing there is the improved completion designs that have
really carried the day to improve the economics and our rates of return that we have out there where we upped the sand
content around 3.5 million pounds of sand, around 6 million pounds of sand or around from 700 pounds to 1,200
pounds per lateral foot and we're frankly testing that over 2,000 pounds per lateral foot now. We may see even further
improvements besides the type curve improvement we've already described to you. And so that carries the day. We
have baked these lower NGL prices that Darryl described into our rates of return. And bottom-line with the approved
completion techniques that we're seeing these wells compete well with the other opportunities that we're funding this
year because of those improved completion designs.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Okay. Okay, that's great. Thanks for the detail there. The other thing I had is you guys have
talked and this actually goes to some of the work you guys have done in that same field, but about optimizing
performance on base production. I think you had had some acid jobs that you're doing out there. And you'd shown
some really nice upticks there. Can you give a rough and I know it would have to be rough, company-wide base decline
estimate? And that can be either net or not net of whatever maintenance efforts you guys are undertaking? I know
you're doing the same in the Barnett too.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Hi. James this is Tony Vaughn again. Our base decline just overall for the company without
CapEx is roughly about 20%, maybe not quite that high. Some of the good work that the teams have done across the
company have really focused on uptime. They focused on line pressure reductions in areas like the Barnett and at Cana.
As you mentioned, we've worked on some chemical jobs in Cana that really had a strong boost in our rate. It had a
major rate impact in 2014. The guys are looking at artificial lift with a strong focus on that more than we had in the
past. So all that collectively, in my mind, in 2014 was probably one of the primary reasons for our outperformance over
expectations.
And so I think there's a renewed vigor. We've really segregated our workforce into a couple of different areas. So we
have the team in every business unit that's focused on nothing but the base. We also have a team focused on the
execution part of the business as well as the asset management side. So I think we'll just bring a lot of clarity and a lot
of focus to the well bores that we operate.
<A - John Richels>: Let me just add a little bit to that too. I often get asked when I'm out meeting with investors why
are we doing – is this the new Devon? Why are we doing so much better operationally? And Tony is actually probably
even if anything he's underselling the transformation that's taken place internally to Devon and around the execution,

around the assets. Bottom-line, we are very focused on being one of, if not the best operator in each of our core areas.
And it's not just words that we're saying here but we – about 18 months ago, we took some of our top technical
professionals away for a few months along with a couple of consultants and said what do we need to do to transform
our operational performance?
And what you're seeing today is the results of that effort and there are a number of very specific initiatives that came
out of that where we added technical staff that Tom mentioned earlier, where we've added – separated the execution
from the long-term asset management. We've added project management skills. We have a 24/7 well control center
where we manage all the operations of all our wells. We have SCADA operations, we have computerized operations in
all of our field offices where we remotely monitor the production of all the wells.
I could go on with several other things, but I think that's what gives us confidence is the type of performance that you're
seeing out of Devon is going to continue on into the future. We've got the top assets. We've got strong balance sheet.
You're seeing the execution now. We're humble about it, but we intend to continue doing what we're doing. We're
going to keep getting even better.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Thank you, guys. That's a lot of great color on the base maintenance. I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Just thinking about
improving service equipment reliability and just the efficiency and pace of wells per rig per year, can you give us some
thoughts about fourth quarter 2015 versus fourth quarter 2014 of – is it a 10% improvement or are there any particular
areas where mud mudders or frac equipment was less reliable and now that the industry has slowed down, you'd see a
bigger improvement in just that efficiency side as we head into 2016?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Hi. David, this is Tony Vaughn again. I think what you're describing is well within our
expectations for as we go through 2015. As Dave mentioned, we're putting a lot of thoughts into and a lot more
granularity into all of our well bore designs. We're really trying to drive out efficiency using project management skills
to manage cost, to stay on schedule. We're starting to see the benefits of that right now. We've incorporated some
stretch inside of each of our business units for the execution part of our work, so I think the 10% improvements that
you've described is relevant.
I'd also mention that we've – through our capital allocation process, we have really cored up into the sweet spots of
these areas that we work in. We're really doing more development type work and less appraisal work. We have spent a
fair amount of money on science in some of these appraisal areas such as the Lavaca County and also in the Delaware.
All that will come to – will pay off dividends here probably in the second half of this year. So I think the 10% that you
described is probably well within reason.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: Okay. And so as we think going into 2016 just kind of modeling the increase in wells
at this rig count before you even think about ramping rig count is reasonable? That's cool. The other question and I just
wanted to make sure I was understanding what you said on the LOE front that you haven't factored in any cost savings?
Not putting words in your mouth but again kind of the same 10% CapEx reduction that you've built in, I don't see a
reason why some of your maintenance and kind of base LOE couldn't come down that same amount as we go into
2016. Is that a reasonable framework?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: You know what, David? We've put some challenge to our business units. Cost containment is
going be a real driving force inside of each of our business unit teams. I think the ability to reduce LOE is there. I think
a larger percent of that cost component is associated with labor, which is a little bit stickier than some of the other
things that we've talked about today. I do think we still have the ability to shave off some LOE, and it'll be a little bit
better than what we have forecasted. But you have to remember we're seeing projects like the Barnett, which is
accretive to the company, LOE is starting to decline, replacing that with some higher costs barrels in places like the

Delaware. So we're working that, got a lot of focus on that as we just described.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: One last one. And I'm assuming you don't want to give an expectation for an exit rate
for production at this point for 2015?
<A - John Richels>: David, I don't think we're not focused on really on the...
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: Yeah.
<A - John Richels>: ...or giving an exit rate. But suffice it to say, our production stays pretty strong through the year.
We have a pretty good bump in the first quarter and then it holds pretty steady after that throughout the year. So we put
ourselves into really a great position with a ton of flexibility as we move into 2016, which I think is really the important
part as well.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: Yep. All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Hi, good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to first ask you a question on the Eagle Ford and
perhaps to maybe try to understand to what level the new completion design is driving the improved results. I was
wondering if you had any data on perhaps wells that are located in the same area and what you're seeing in terms of the
new completion design versus the old one.
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, Tony can get a little more specific here, but in general, the wells that you saw, Arun, in
the fourth quarter were the results of a revised design that we worked with BHP on it, I generally characterize as
probably we – somewhere around 80% of where we would have liked to go with the completion design. Now, we
added for a period of time during the fourth quarter two-completion crews that Devon operated by themselves and
pumped a number of jobs. Those wells are just now starting to come on-line. So we're not sure if you're going to see the
other incremental improvement or not, but we'll see and we'll probably have the results for that in the first quarter. But
the type curve improvement that you're seeing, I think, is in wells that are in like type areas. And that's the result of
that. I don't know if Tony wants to add any more detail around that.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Yeah. I think that's right, Dave. BHP has got a good design. I think they've actually been
changing that over the course of the last 9 months to 10 months, which is approaching a similar design to Devon. We
pump a little bit more sand, we pump more fluid, they have a little bit different philosophy there. But I think their
completions are moving up. It'll be interesting to see if the design that we pumped on the 28 wells that we've worked on
in DeWitt County have any incremental benefit in that. But I think overall, we're starting to see good collaboration
between the two companies trying to take the best from both. I'd also mention to you that some of the science that we're
doing, especially in Lavaca County, is very unique. We've run fiber optics, we've drilled vertical well there, taken 240
feet of core, doing a lot of seismic work, micro-seismic work, trying to have a really good understanding of what
de-levers value on the completions in the Eagle Ford. So I think that will continue to improve.
We're also seeing a lot of benefits from our production optimization work that I think we've talked about in the past.
And there our guys had taken a really eloquent approach to managing bottom oil pressures and rate. We're seeing the
type curves move up and exceeding performance on that. We're waiting to see if there will be a corresponding
improvement in the expected ultimate recovery per well. I think that could come, but we need a little bit more data to
understand that better.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Thank you for that. And my follow-up question is just regarding future potential dropdowns to
EnLink. I guess you guys highlighted in the ops report about expecting to do the Victoria Express Pipeline some time
in 2015. I was wondering if you could maybe give some more details around that.

And secondly, regarding Access, how big of a factor would be in terms of that ultimate valuation would the FID be on
Pike in terms of future volumes?
<A - John Richels>: Yeah, Arun, what we talked about with Victoria Express is potentially dropping that down in
some time in the first half of the year, guys, on both the – our folks here and on the EnLink team are working on that
and what that would look like and what the valuation would be and we can't give you a whole lot more color around
that right now.
As we move into Access, we're working a lot on that. There are some complexities with it because it's in Canada. And
it's a large asset. It will certainly – our pace of development of Pike later on in the year will certainly have some
bearing on that valuation. So as we get to the time of the year when we're re-visiting that and making that decision, that
will come into play.
But we always talked about the dropdown on Access probably being late in 2015 or maybe even moving over to the
beginning of 2016.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay. But it sounds like in the next year or so?
<A - John Richels>: Yes, sir. I think that's what we're looking at right now. But there's a lot of moving parts right now,
so we'll have to see whether it works out that way. That's currently what we're moving towards. Now, whether we get
all that work done and whether it all pans out exactly the way we think will remain to be seen. But what we've always
talked about is potentially doing it in the latter half of this year or early in 2016.

Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Société Générale. Your line is open.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Yeah. Hi. Two quick ones. In the U.S., you had a negative 38 million barrel revision for oil that
wasn't related to price. John, earlier you talked about the revisions being related to the five-year rules. Is that the case
for the oil in the U.S.?
<A - John Richels>: John, just – Tony can answer that.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Sorry, John, that was largely the five-year rule was largely related to gas.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Okay. I figured but...
<A - John Richels>: On the oil side, we saw a little bit of underperformance in our expectations in the Mississippian.
So we wrote down some per well performance there. And also in the Southern Midland Basin, we had to write down a
little bit of reserves associated with that. But mostly as John had mentioned, these were mostly gas write-offs and
associated with the five-year rule.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Okay, that's fine. EnLink bought the Coronado system in the Midland Basin. Darryl, how are you
configured for the Delaware side in terms of GTP? You have adequate infrastructure at this stage?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Yeah, John. Just to kind of paint the background here and I think we've mentioned this
before. But a lot of the acreage Devon has in the Permian Basin is acreage that we've acquired over time. The vast
majority of that acreage is currently dedicated to other parties. And so we have very little acreage that's available to go
into any of the EnLink facilities out there although the acreage, it is available and their facilities are closed, they're
certainly a party that we talk to all the time.
In terms of the facilities that are third-party facilities, we have issues every now and then close to the wellhead. We
have to put in different types of facilities. That kind of ebbs and flows and it depends on the performance of the wells
generally. So when we are seeing some really, really good results from some of the wells when they come on stream,

which has happened more recently, there is a period of time when we have to have the facilities that catch up. Our
third-party providers have done a very good job of doing that for us. We have a team of Devon, what we call facility
and pipeline people who are busy installing the facilities that we need to get to the third-party people.
So right now, we feel pretty good about where we're at. We have a few bottlenecks. We have some wells that are
offline waiting for some pipeline and some other facilities to be installed. Most of that will be up and operational by the
end of the second quarter. But we have made pretty good progress and for the most part are staying ahead of the curve.
But there are some isolated incidents where we have a two or three-month wait to make sure all of our production
moves.

Your next question comes from the line of Kapil Singh with DoubleLine Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Kapil Singh>: Hi, guys. Just a quick question on leverage. Where do you see that going? What are your targets
over the next, call it, 12 months? And then related to that, your ratings as well? And then what's sort of the plan to
achieve whatever those targets are?
<A - Thomas L. Mitchell>: Yeah, this is Tom. We're pretty solid in our ratings. We just have visited with the rating
agencies in the last few weeks. So, they're comfortable with where we are. They're comfortable with the capital plan.
As far as movement in leverage, it should be pretty much where you're seeing it. We're relatively neutral on a cash flow
spend in the plan and what we presented before them. So it's really one of the sweet spots for the company right now.
We're very strong in this area and with the agencies.
<Q - Kapil Singh>: But is leverage going to stay consistent as earnings drive EBITDA drops? But that I think is
staying the same, right? You're not planning to pay down debt or is that wrong?
<A - Thomas L. Mitchell>: No, there's no particular debt pay-down plan. As you get into 2016 and 2017, I'm not
really projecting out into that timeframe right now, but for the near-term, year and a half, it's stable.

You have a follow-up question from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic Global. Your line is open.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Hey, guys. Just a quick clarification. You guys have 13 second Bone Spring wells that you
talked about both in the ops reports of Q3 and Q4 that had the very good 30-day rates above 900 Boes. All 26 of those
were done with the heavier sand loadings. Is that right?
<A - John Richels>: That's correct.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Okay, great. Just wanted to check that out, so that's a pretty significant corpus of data there.
<A - John Richels>: And we are testing bigger sand rates beyond that, James, just to give you an idea and we'll have
results on that in the future.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Great. Great. The other thing I had was you guys had a little bit of commentary in the ops
report about the possibility of EUR estimates going up. You guys have revised the type curves but have generally done
it with increasing the IP rates, the 30-day rates. And I guess that that could be interpreted as hedging your bets on
whether you're accelerating resource or adding it per well? Is it fair to say that you guys are seeing something with the
longer data series that you're seeing data that would suggest to you that you are capturing new resource with the new
completions?

<A - John Richels>: We are very confident in the Bone Spring that we are going to increase the EURs. We're just
trying to figure out what the number is and get a little more production history before we do that. In the Eagle Ford,
Tony talked about it, it's less certain. It's earlier on. We think there's a possibility we may bring up the EURs there as
well but there's less certainty there than the Bone Spring.
