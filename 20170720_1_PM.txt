MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call
is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of
Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli
Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our
2017 second quarter results, and you may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app.
During our call today, please note that the following unless otherwise stated. First, we will be talking about results for
the second quarter of 2017 and comparing them to the same period in 2016. Second, all references to total industry,
PMI volume and PMI market share performance reflects cigarettes and PMI's heated tobacco units for those markets
that have commercial sales of IQOS. A glossary of terms, adjustments, and other calculations, as well as reconciliations
to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are post on our
website.
Reduced risk products, or RRPs, is the term we use to refer to products that present or are likely to present, or have the
potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the
forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the
various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections for forward-looking statements.
It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?

Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We are pleased by our performance in the second quarter,
notably reflecting strong currency-neutral financial results including growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 8.7%.
Sequential improvement in our total shipment volume declined compared to the first quarter, and market share growth
for Marlboro across a broad range of geographies, and continued positive momentum for IQOS, notably in Japan, but
also across other large markets.
As announced this morning, we are revising, for currency only, our 2017 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing
exchange rates to a range of $4.78 to $4.93. Our guidance now includes approximately $0.14 of unfavorable currency.
Excluding currency and a favorable $0.04 tax item recorded in the first quarter, our guidance continues to represent a
growth rate of approximately 9% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016. As a reminder, we
expect higher currency neutral growth in the second half of 2017, mainly reflecting increased heated tobacco unit
shipment volume, partly offset by continued investments behind the commercialization of IQOS.
The $0.06 increase in unfavorable currency put in our guidance as compared to our previous guidance on April 20 is
due principally to the depreciation of the Japanese yen and Russian ruble versus the U.S. dollar. Please note that the
currency impact of the yen depreciation relates to the unhedged portion of our 2017 forecast sales to Japan and is
amplified by the strong performance of IQOS.
Let me now take you through our second quarter results in more detail beginning with our total cigarette and heated
tobacco unit shipment volume, which declined by 5%. The decline was due mainly to lower cigarette industry volume
in Asia and EEMA regions. In Asia, this notably reflected a challenging consumer spending environment in Indonesia
as well as ongoing declines of low margin volumes in Pakistan and the Philippines.
In EEMA, this mainly reflected the impact of excise tax driven price increases in Russia and an increase in illicit trade
in Turkey. The decline was also due to lower volume in Saudi Arabia related to the introduction in June of an excise
tax that resulted in a doubling of retail selling prices. In the case of Marlboro, the retail price increased by SAR 12 to
reach SAR 24 or approximately $6.40 per pack. The cigarette volume decline was partly offset by the strong growth of
our heated tobacco products, principally in Japan, which increased by 5.2 billion units to reach 6.4 billion units in the
quarter.
As expected, we recorded a sequential improvement in our total volume decline during the second quarter, driven by
favorable evolutions compared to the first quarter in three of our four regions: EU, EEMA and Latin America and
Canada. Excluding the negative impact on our volume performance of industry-wide trade inventory movements,
principally in Indonesia and Pakistan, the Asia region would also have recorded a favorable evolution.
For the full year, we continue to anticipate a total shipment volume decline of 3% to 4%, broadly in line with last year.
This reflects a further expected sequential improvement in the third and the fourth quarters, notably driven by the Asia
region with higher RRP volume and improved cigarette volume in markets such as Indonesia, Pakistan and the
Philippines. In Pakistan specifically, we expect the recent fiscal restructuring, which introduced a new excise tax tier
for lower-priced product, to ease the pressure on cigarette industry volume from illicit trade over the balance of the
year.
We recorded strong currency-neutral results in the second quarter. Net revenues increased by 7%, driven by higher
heated tobacco unit and IQOS device sales, notably in Japan as well as favorable pricing. Adjusted OCI increased by
5.9%, primarily reflecting the impact of higher net revenues, partly offset by increased investment supporting the
commercialization of IQOS, notably in the EU region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 8.7%.
Net revenues for our RRP portfolio reached $615 million or 8.9% of total net revenues in the second quarter,
continuing the strong sequential growth trend. As we have noted previously, a portion of our RRP net revenues are
from IQOS devices, which yield a negative margin due to introductory discounts offered in the initial
commercialization phase to accelerate adult smoker switching. For reference, IQOS devices contributed approximately
22% of our RRP net revenues in 2016. Underpinned by the strong growth outlook for RRPs, we now anticipate total

currency-neutral net revenue growth above 7% this year.
We recorded a pricing variance of $367 million in the second quarter, supported by all regions. Our year-to-date June
pricing variance of $775 million represent 6.1% of first-half 2016 net revenues. This is despite no net pricing in Russia,
which I will discuss in more detail shortly.
Turning to market share, we recorded strong sequential growth in the second quarter, with our total international share
excluding China and the U.S. up by 80 basis points to 27.6%. This growth was driven by both our cigarette and heated
tobacco portfolios. Within the cigarette category, Marlboro's international share increased sequentially by 10 basis
points to 9.6%.
I will now discuss a few of our key geographies, beginning with the EU region. Total industry volume in the second
quarter declined by 1%, with sequential improvement compared to the first quarter that included the higher recovery
from elicit trade in Poland and the lower impact from the 10s packs ban in Italy. June year-to-date industry volume
declined by 1.8%, slightly better than our full-year decline forecast of 2% to 3%.
Our regional market share was down by 20 basis points in the quarter, mainly due to Germany, Italy and Spain partly
offset by France and Poland. In Germany, the lower share largely reflected the combined impact of price increases in
March this year which, for reference of the per-pack price of Marlboro and L&M increased by €0.30 to €6.30 and €5.90
respectively, as well as the later timing of competitors' price increases.
In Italy and Spain, the lower shares reflected the continuation of the pressures related to Marlboro price points
discussed last quarter. Though, it is worth highlighting that our shares for Marlboro in this market increased by 40 and
20 basis points respectively, versus the first quarter.
Regional adjusted OCI in the quarter declined by 3.7% excluding currency, primarily reflecting higher investments
behind the commercialization of IQOS; this investment supporting the encouraging market and offtake share trend in
our launch market, which I will cover later in the presentation.
Moving to Russia, total industry volume declined by 6.2% in the quarter, due primarily to the impact of excise tax
driven price increases. For the full year, we continue to expect a decline in the range of 5% to 6%. Our May
quarter-to-date cigarette share increased slightly versus the same period last year, and continued the fairly stable
sequential share performance of the past four quarters.
Recently launched Philip Morris continues to grow share, reflecting the successful morphing of Optima and Apollo
Soyuz, as well as adult smoker down-trading in the market. While the industry volume decline and the market share
trends have been in line with expectation, our price realization is lower than anticipated due to increased competitive
pricing. This is putting pressure on our ability to grow profitability in the market.
In the Philippines, higher pricing and favorable portfolio mix reflecting the strong performance of Marlboro drove
another quarter of profitability growth. While our cigarette share declined in the quarter, Marlboro's share increased by
3.8 points driven by in-switching from lower-priced brands. Importantly, we are beginning to see a stabilization in our
cigarette share, which increased by 20 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter.
The cigarette industry volume decline rate moderated sequentially, with a decline of 5.7% in the second quarter,
following a 15.3% decline in the prior quarter. As we look toward the balance of the year, we are encouraged by the
combination of recent competitor price increases and lower competitor discounting at the bottom of the market. This
has led to a reduction in the price gaps between our portfolio, notably Fortune, and lower priced competitor brands,
enhancing the overall competitiveness of our portfolio, particularly in the low and the super-low price segments.
In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume in the second quarter was adversely impacted by three main factors: a
challenging comparison due to largely inventory movements mainly associated with the timing of Ramadan, above
inflation tax-driven retail price increases and the effect of higher utility prices on consumer spending. We now
anticipate a decline of around 3% this year.

Our cigarette market share declined by 60 basis points in the quarter, due mainly to the soft performance of our
hand-rolled kretek portfolio. The decline was partly offset by Marlboro, reflecting the growth of Marlboro Filter Black
in the full flavor machine-made kretek segment, and the strong early performance of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild, a
lighter tasting machine-made kretek product that we launched in May. These two offerings are driving our growth in
the overall machine-made kretek segment, the largest and fastest growing product segment industry wide.
In Japan, the spectacular growth of HeatSticks continues to drive our results. The brand shipment in the second quarter
increased by 37% on a sequential basis to reach 5.7 billion units, accounting for over 40% of our total shipments in
Japan. Total market share increased by 4.5 points to 32%, with HeatSticks up by 7.8 points to 10%. On a sequential
basis, HeatSticks grew by an impressive 2.9 points versus last quarter. During the second quarter, we expanded the
availability of two new HeatSticks variants in the smooth taste and differentiated menthol taste segments respectively,
and both are performing very well.
Total industry volume declined by 3.2% excluding inventory movements, consistent with the secular decline rate for
cigarettes prior to the introduction of IQOS. The strong performance of IQOS in Japan is further evidenced by our retail
offtake shares, as seen on this slide. HeatSticks closed the quarter with a weekly offtake share of 12.7% nationally, up
by 3.1 points versus the last week of the first quarter. This growth was achieved despite a continued cap on the number
of IQOS devices supplied to the market, as well as the increasing presence of competitors' products in select
geographies.
Turning to the commercialization of IQOS more broadly, we have now launched IQOS in key cities in 27 markets
globally, following city launches in Korea in May and the Czech Republic earlier this month. We are particularly
pleased with the early performance in Korea, and last week announced increased distribution within Seoul, as well as
further expansion into four additional cities. We remain on track to be in key cities or nationwide in a total of 30 to 35
markets by year end, subject to capacity.
Importantly, we continue to grow the national share of our heated tobacco portfolio sequentially in many of our early
launch markets beyond Japan. For example, in Italy, Portugal and Romania, our national share increased to 0.6% or
above in the second quarter. While we have expanded the weighted retail distribution of our heated tobacco portfolio
across these markets, Japan remains for the time being the only market with national coverage, due to capacity
constraints.
In many of our more recent launch markets, we are recording positive sequential quarterly offtake share trends within
the current focus area, as seen on this slide. Our performance in Greece, for example, has been particularly strong,
reaching 2% share in the Athens region less than one year after launch.
To conclude, our second quarter results were robust, reflecting sequential improvement in total volume and market
share compared to the first quarter. Our currency-neutral net revenue growth in the quarter was strong, driven by the
continued momentum of IQOS and favorable pricing. We now expect full-year currency-neutral net revenue growth of
over 7% in 2017.
Our 2017 EPS guidance, revised today for currency only, continues to reflect a growth rate of approximately 9% to
12%, excluding currency and the favorable tax item. This compares to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016.
Finally, we remain focus on generously rewarding our shareholders with our robust cash flow. For the year, we
continue to target operating cash flow of approximately $8.5 billion and capital expenditures of $1.6 billion.
Thank you, and I will be happy now to answer your questions.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hello, Vivien.
Operator
Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Patty Kanada>: Hi. Good morning. This is Patty.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, good morning.
<Q - Patty Kanada>: Hi. This is Patty Kanada calling in for Bonnie. Just a quick question on South Korea. Could you
give us a sense of what you've learned so far with IQOS there in terms of conversion rates, cannibalization? Any big
surprises you could share? Are you feeling incrementally more or less optimistic about the replicability of the Japan
model there?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: It's very early stages but for a reason, we're not talking about the market shares, et cetera. But I
think the first reaction of the Korean smokers are much better than what we experienced at the same period when we
entered Japan, vastly much better. I guess obviously Korea benefits from the somehow cross borders growing
awareness coming from Japan. So the brand at the consumer level clearly was better prepared. But I think Korea may
equally or better surprise us in terms of the results than Japan. This would be my reading at this stage.
<Q - Patty Kanada>: Okay. And just one quick follow-up on Japan pricing. Could you confirm that you applied to
raise prices in September? And if so, would that be absent of any sort of tax increase, which I think is more typically
the time that we see pricing?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Finally, we have applied for the price increase of Marlboro in the conventional cigarette and
timing for the implementation is September this year. And I am not aware at this stage of any other competitor price
changes in Japan.
<Q - Patty Kanada>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning. Hi.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So, Jacek, a couple of questions first on your guidance. First, just in terms of thinking about your
revenue growth guidance FX-neutral, now you're expecting over 7% but you haven't changed the earnings guidance
FX-neutral. So I just wanted to get a sense of why not higher in terms of earnings even with higher revenue. And then
even the 7% revenue growth guidance seems somewhat conservative in the context of IQOS likely to really build much
more contribution in the back half with the capacity ramping up. So just trying to get a sense of, I know you said over
7%, but kind of what sort of contribution from IQOS in the back half should we expect in terms of the revenue?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Look at, Judy, don't boil us down to the available capacity, okay. I think we observe, as we
speak, a better productivity from the installed machines. So we might be able to go beyond the 32 billion which we had
initially announced available capacity for this year. If this would happen, I mean agree they will be able to sell of the
sheet more. What I can say, look, if we have that product available and then we can actually do the revenue better than
a 7%. But at this stage, we're just saying that we will above 7%. What precisely that number will be, I think we will

update it, that view of that outlook in the Q3, as we will know how much really the productions we had, capacity we
had.
When it comes to the 1 point lift in our revenue guidance, if you like, and not lifting the guidance, I mean we have a
range 9% to 12%, so this is pretty or relatively broad territory. I had highlighted in my remarks that we actually have a
pretty challenging situation from a pricing perspective in Russia, so we have to be relatively cautious in this one.
Although very recently it comes some good news from the fiscal authorities with regards on the view on the potential
excise increase in 2018, which will not materially, or at all, change the 2017, but gives us a better outlook for 2018.
And we still have to see what is a total impact from this very high packs price increase in Saudi. Okay. And that's very
much the Q2, sorry, Q3, Q4 type of a event which we'll have in front of us. So we'll see what will happen.
We continues to investing behind in IQOS because, as you could see, the growth rate in all geographies are very solid,
very good, very encouraging. We opened recently Korea. We have a few other markets which we will have very likely,
we'll have to very likely put up an investment to support that rolling level which these markets are generating now. So
we'll see how we close.
But I think it's a nice problem to have. As long as we see the good quality of top line growth, and you presumably
noticed that for the first time, we not only driving the revenue by pricing variance, but there is a pretty good
contribution at the revenue level from a volume mix actually, a product mix. So I think the quality very nicely comes
through the top line and I think it will one day also flow very nicely to the bottom line.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just my second question is just in terms of thinking about IQOS and seeing
particularly in the markets where obviously some of the competitive products have launched. So in Sendai and Japan,
you obviously had a little bit of more of a lead time in IQOS being in those markets before glo came in. In Korea, it
sounds like you're going have glo going in more quickly; Korea Tobacco talking about a competitive launch there, too.
So I'm just wondering from your perspective, just not having that much of a lead time in those markets, do you think
that that's going to curtail IQOS performance? Or if you kind of look at markets in Japan, just the broader category
expansion could be accelerated, and so for IQOS, could continue to grow. So how do you sort of think about the timing
of some of these competitive launches now in some of the market that could be sooner than what you saw in Japan?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Look, I think that I actually welcome the competitors entering the heat-not-burn category,
because from a consumer awareness perspective, et cetera, it's actually is going to help rather than us driving the,
building the awareness of the category, the product, the brand on our own. We have been coexisting at least at the city
test basis with a competitor's product, the [ph] GET product and the BET (25:21) product.
You see the growth trajectory of IQOS in these places and we feel pretty comfortable. But overall, our thinking's
actually not that bad, that the competitors also coming to the market and the general awareness of the product is – of
the category, sorry, is growth. I mean IQOS, it's early days. I mean we'll have to look at the national expansion like
here announced by the competitors in Japan, I mean how it is going to change the dynamics in terms of the growth rates
of IQOS. But at this stage, I think we feel pretty confident that consumer will, we will continue having high conversion
rates and very importantly high stickiness rate to our proposition.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay. And then just finally quickly on the hedging on the yen, because it sounds like
second quarter, the FX was a lot worse than many people had anticipated.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yeah.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So can you just give a sense of what happened in 2Q from a hedge perspective and where we are
at this point?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, at the beginning of the year, if I remember, we said that we were covered with the yen for
about 40%. We obviously brought up the hedge ratio higher to about 50%. But in the meantime, the cash flows and
revenue from Japan start shooting higher also than we initially thought. So it's a little bit now of a moving target. So
that after all we have this exposure. We have this exposure and still uncovered exposure on yen. But yen in Q2, just Q2
if I take then actuals, right, the $0.11 which we had in a quarter, yen actually contributed to the negative only by $0.01.

So think it's more what we think will be the cash flows and our hedge ratios going forward than if we value this at the
spot rate. So this obviously changes that outlook by the guidance of $0.14. The two currencies which moved us in this
quarter were euro by $0.04 and Egyptian pound of $0.04. And Egyptian pound is something which we need to pay
attention, because we had last quarter of 2016, who had a quite big negative currency volumes, despite the fact that the
majority of the currencies were actually improving versus dollar. And this is where the transactional losses which we
incur on Egyptian pound.
Now Egyptian pound is relatively pretty stable since then after this massive devaluation. So at the current spot rate, we
should have a complete reversal of the negative variance on a currency line in Q4 which may lead to the, or should lead
the current spot rates to the situations that we will still have some negative currency in Q3, and we should flip
completely to the positive currency in Q4. And this blended will give us this $0.14 which we have announced today in
the guidance

Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Thanks. I wanted to come back to the Russian pricing dynamic. It sounds like this may
continue for at least a few more months. Is that going to have any impact on your expectations for 6% combustible
pricing for the year or any impact on your ability to reach potentially the higher end of the EPS guidance range? And
when we think about potential offsets in the P&L to help compensate for lower pricing there, do you have sufficient
flexibility in other markets to compensate for that without having to make any changes in your RRP investment plans?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Matthew, result going into specifically the pricing variance for the full year, which obviously
Russia will wait. Because if now for the six months, two quarters, we essentially have no net pricing despite the fact
that for the first two quarters, PMI had above 6% pricing variance. But it's going to wait for the year. I would rather
focus that the pricing situation in Russia is well factored in in our net revenue outlook for the year by above 7%. So this
is how we're trying to manage the situations.
Clearly, if we would have had not a lot of the pricing opportunity to take extra pricing in Russia, I mean, that revenue
and the pricing variance correspondently was behind, but this is the situations in Russia today. Remember, usually as of
Q2, us, I guess industry, we're even at positive, solve the pricing situations in Russia, right. So generate price increases,
pass-ons, a little bit ahead towards the back end of the year, the previous year and the current year.
And now we end in June, and if my estimates are correct, industry and us, are presumably a few rubles, maybe up to
RUB 5 below the personage of January this year. So actually, the only pricing which you have in Russia today is the
fading out annualization of the past year and you have no net pricing due to current year. But then as I said, this is
factored in a 7% or higher revenue growth for us. So that's the situation.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks. And just in terms of the impact on the EPS outlook and where you might
fall in that range, obviously you don't want to pull back at all on spending behind IQOS and the broader RRP platforms.
Are you confident that there's enough additional offsets in the combustible business? Maybe it's stronger profit
performance in other combustible markets that could help compensate for that. Or if pricing doesn't come through, does
that limit your ability to maybe get to the higher end of the 9% to 12% range?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean, a few factors which we have for the Q3 and Q4 ahead of us. First, I think we
expect the correction of volumes in Indonesia due to the timing, right. Because Indonesia alone due to the timing of this

inventory movement around Ramadan, et cetera, I guess our estimate is about the 2 billion units in Indonesia which we
should see the payback of that in Q3. There is a bit lower growth in Indonesia compared to the last year but pricing
goes through. The consumer is a bit softer than in past years.
Philippines are going where we wanted Philippines to go, so that I wouldn't expect any surprises. The price gaps are
getting close. Marlboro performs well. I think we might also improve our competitive situation and profitability
situations at both end of the market. So I think Philippines should nicely be continue contributing. Indonesia, I said
should have a better second half of the year than the first half of the year. Pakistan will help on the volumes. We know
that Pakistan is not really the driver of national performance, but it's good to solve this problem.
Russia, I wouldn't count on any surprises on the pricing there on both sides. And the big question mark is how
consumers going to take this 100% or doubling of the prices in Saudi and there are still a few other states, which as we
understand, also plan to increase the taxes between now and the year-end, so we'll have to see how this unfolds.
EU has a good strength both on the underlying volumes. Share is in a good shape. It's more the questions how much we
will put in terms of investment behind the IQOS, which we may wish to sacrifice the profitability over in the EU for the
sake of locking or building the right revenue opportunity which lies in front of IQOS in EU. But this is how I will do it.
The range is 9% to 12%. There was reasons why we expanded that range. I think we will deliver in the range, that's
clearly, therefore today we have reaffirmed. We have not revised the range or the target EPS range for other factors
than the currency. We considered that all this, we will hit the high end of the range. Look, I mean it's speculation. We'll
have to see.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Hopefully Russia improves. And then can I just ask about plain packaging in
France and the UK? UK is pretty recent, but France since the beginning of the year. Can you just give us whatever
observations you have at this point on consumer behavior and reaction, what the impact has been on mix dynamics,
volumes? Has there been any shift in pricing dynamics in the super-low segment in the UK since May?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think, you guys, a little bit still early to talk about this. France is a few months longer with the
plain packaging. And I don't want to sound sarcastic, okay, but remember when we had these discussions in Australia a
couple of years ago, the early quarters of implementation, there was the market share erosions and down-trading and
people were trying to connect the dots between a plain packaging and what is happening in the market, which we were
arguing that this is correlation not causation at the best place.
In France actually, Marlboro grew share in the quarter by 60 basis points. This is the quarter post plain-packaging
implementation, and I'm not implying this has to do with the plain packaging. I think it's another argument, which the
market dynamics at least in the short term has nothing to do with the plain packaging implementation.
We always were using this argument that the two things are somehow not related. And actually my total share, if I
recall the number correctly, it's in the release, I think we grew the share, total PMI by almost 1% full, 90 basis points.
So doesn't seem that there is down-trading in the market. It doesn't seem that the premium brands or premium segment
at this stage is impacted by plain package, but I would be surprised frankly speaking that it would be.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Jacek.

<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Thanks. With the Korea question earlier, you touched a little bit on some of the awareness
boost that it gets from having Japan right next door and some interaction there. Can you just talk a little bit about in
other markets, how your spending for this year compares to what you had expected or thought that it would be? And
related to that, how much does national distribution really help in terms of just getting in front of that many more
people and helping the word of mouth or sort of network effect? And are you spending any to offset not having national
distribution in some markets, in Europe for example?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you. It's a very good question actually, because yes, the national distribution would help in
building the momentum and to growing the awareness. On the other hand, national distribution requires the full
availability of full capacity, okay, to meet the very likely surge in demand. So reasons why we're holding many of our
markets, essentially all of our markets outside Japan, to the city type of territories is for the reasons that we would
create a essentially unmanageable constraint on the supply chain.
We're barely still until the end of this quarter, we're coping with Japan. The capacity should start easing Q3, Q4. But
again, as we have highlighted before over there, I mean, the priority is to stabilize Japan from a supply chain
perspective, okay. And we need to leave the quota for the devices. We're also working on developing a second device
supplier, so we'll have a full flexibility on the devices. Hopefully, full flexibility of the HeatSticks volumes for Japan,
and then we can start leveraging the expanded distribution as the factor of increasing the awareness in other markets.
But you're absolutely spot on in your questions. There is some correlations between a broader availability of the
product and awareness. There's a little deduction for us, but in the territories what we focus at these stages, even these
restricted sort of territories, as much as obviously one can restrict a territory in a given market, but in these restricted
territories, the growth trajectory acceptance conversions are very positive. I mean, you see this on the charts. We pretty
regularly update this performance on every market. There are differences between the markets, but they have one
common denominator. They all have growth. That's very encouraging for us.
And with regards to spending, we will maintain high level of spending in Japan. That's pretty obvious. But we're now
serving Japan, some of this year we'll close or bypass 3 million consumers. So that obviously entails or requires some
support, which we are willing to do. And obviously, building up or preparing the rest of the market, mainly you will see
quite the spending year-on-year in comparison behind IQOS, in particular in the EU region. Obviously Korea will
come in, Asia, for business on the early stages, so there will be investments made in Korea.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Yeah, thank you. And then just on Indonesia, certainly the machine-made kreteks
have been gaining all the momentum and you've typically been under-represented there. How significant do you think
this Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild launch can be? And how do you see the portfolio evolving as far as where the
consumer demand has been making shifts?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Can be very significant. We're trying to compete on a full-flavor pipe part of the machine-made
into the lighter, smoother part of that segment. It is a growing segment and it is large and very fastly growing segment.
We obviously, it's important segment for us as a building block of our continuous leadership in the market. So we'll be
very focused there.
We're also very pleased with the Marlboro entrance to the kretek segment, if you like. Very good results despite that
there was some sort of a cannibalization between Marlboro Lights and Marlboro, to Marlboro kretek. Combined
Marlboro franchise nicely grew the share. I think there is still a distribution expansion ahead of this brand. So despite
that they are not in a national-wide availability, they very nicely buffed the new propositions already contributing to the
overall share of the Indonesian market.
So we're very pleased with this and will continue focus on this. There will be some headwind from time to time, which
is very much around the pricing. There are some brands which are sitting at around per-pack price point. But we had it
in the past. So this is sort of a cyclical type of a thing. But we'll focus, to conclude to answering your questions, we'll
focus on a machine-made tek match going forward.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: I think the Marlboro kretek launched about eight or nine months ago and you said it still
had some distribution upside. How do you expect the distribution trajectory for Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild? Will that

move a little more quickly or something similar?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I mean, yes. We'll be building this distribution. Will it grow faster than Marlboro? It's hard for
me to say now, but clearly that expansion, the classical launch plan in Indonesia is that you start with X number of
territories. You build that brand there and then you start going to another territory. It's a pretty large market, okay, so
we don't have it despite the fact we think we have a pretty strong capability to deploy deployment capability in
Indonesia. We don't have a capability to cover Indonesia in a one month or two months in terms of a national
distribution.

Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Good morning. I just had a question for you if I could. First on the volume performance in
the quarter, particularly also around the combustible volumes, was this quarter in line with your expectations from like
a volume – so the sequential progress you made in volume, there was some puts and takes this quarter no doubt, but
does this put you on track towards your progress towards that negative 3% to negative 4% for the year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, it was IQOS could, I guess, by much better than we initially would have thought, but this is
more the function of how much product we had available. So we just essentially sold or ship what we could. And on the
combustible business, on the conventional business, not much actually surprised us. I mean we knew that we will have
that, not a hiccup, but the timing in Indonesia. I have quantified it at roughly about 2 billion for us. So this we'll should
see in a Q3. So the Q3 should come stronger on a versus the Q3 last year.
Pakistan, I think authorities are addressing this problem with illicit trade, or trying to help addressing this problem of
creation of this extra tax here. It's very helpful. It mean that come as a surprise, but the results volume-wise I think
should start accruing Q3, Q4. And we knew that we expecting the tax increase in GCC. Okay, Saudi started. Okay, it's
a little bit of impact on Q2 volume but we sometime, we somehow been factoring this in our projection. You remember
during the first quarter earnings call, I said that we expect the total combined volume for the year to be 2% to 3%. I
think I hint that we might actually come.
<A - Nicholas M. Rolli>: 3% to 4%.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Sorry, 3% to 4%. And that we may come to the, closer 2% to 3%, and actually pretty sure we're
going to come closer to the 3% based on what we have achieved in Q2 and how we've seen our situations develop for
the Q3, Q4.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. When I think about – I'm sorry go ahead.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Go on. Go on.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Was just a question in relation to your IQOS capacity. We know generally what you have
available for the year. How big of a step forward do you make in Q3? Is this the quarter where you're going to see a
marked improvement in your capacity availability in the quarter?

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well Q3 will have to be higher than a Q2, but.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Thank you. Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We're saying. And then Q4 will be higher than a Q3.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. Got you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: But look, it's we're gaining, we're taking a benefit now of a better productivity so we can run the
machine faster and we can install machine faster. So it's not necessary that we can accelerate the CapEx as such, but
once a machine arrive at the factory, we can put them in a production much faster than the first groups of machines. So
it's obvious gain on the timing of implementation and clearly we have a gain that the factory people are doing a
spectacular job of how well they start running these machines, and this is becoming material.
So I have said in the answer to one of the previous questions, we will end up with a higher volume than at 32 billion.
That's very clear to me, but at this stage I wouldn't like to commit to this because this is a productivity gain. So the
calculation is a little bit more complicated. But for sure we're going to end up with a higher volume than 32 billion. It's
like guaranteed
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And then just to be clear on that, are there any markets where you would have a
national – where you want to be national by the end of the year? Or is it just a matter of the incremental capacity being
used for incremental markets to get to those 30, 35 markets?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think we'll try to build the full – we'll have to unblock the supply chain for Japan first, which
includes a proper, lifting hopefully the caps on the devices, have all hand in Japan onshore the right inventory so we
can have a smooth operations from a supply chain perspective in Japan. That's our objective number one. So most of
the capacity will be a priority on the capacity allocations would be for Japan. So I don't think we might be in a situation
to push any market outside Japan for the national distribution. I don't think we'll be in a positions to do so.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: And then obviously is Korea, as I hinted, Korea started better than Japan and we have to start
factoring Korea in these calculations as well. So I think, so we will not go national outside Japan this year like 99%
guarantee.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We'll not be in a position to do this.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. Thanks so much for your time there and your color. Thank you.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: A lot of this unavailability, or not a full availability of the devices has created a lot of
opportunities for other people, completely not related to Philip Morris, and I guess this is from where you're referring
to. So we have a number of e-commerce sites in a various number of places, not only in Japan but outside Japan, where
our device is somehow are being sold. As you know, Vivien, very well, we have a listed price of $110 plus/minus the
currency in the different countries, and we ended up with the devices being sold on these various e-commerce sites at
the prices of $600, $800 or even $1,000.
So that's the situation. Until the moment when we'll completely lift the caps on the devices and we'll be in a ability to
supply fully the market, we'll have all of those things. We have our online sales, our own online PMI sales. So in the
different countries you can go to the iqos.com, korea.com, et cetera. But we are not pushing this through the third-party
channel.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Great. Thanks for the clarification. My second question on IQOS development, recognizing the
bulk of the business is still coming out of Japan. But as you look beyond Japan in some of these other markets,
considering that you have made some adjustments to the product packaging and branding, have you noticed any
differences in terms of initial cannibalization now that you've de-emphasized, or in some cases, totally eliminated the
Marlboro aspect of the Heat's branding?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. No. No, there's no correlation. Actually, whether we're selling the product as a Marlboro
under Marlboro trademark in Japan or as HeatSticks for Marlboro in other places which is the packet dress in other
places, there is no differences in a cannibalization between the two geographies.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Adam Spielman with Citi.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Thank you. So my first question is about IQOS in Europe. You've said a couple of times
that you're increasing the marketing there. But when I look at slide 20 and slide 21, I see sequentially the growth is
slower. So it's slowed a bit in Italy and Switzerland, about the same in Portugal, a bit faster if anything in Romania,
slowed in Germany, slowed in Greece in second quarter, slowed in Russia. And I was just wondering what I should
make of that, particularly in the light of the fact that you said that when you get to 1% or 2% or 3% market share, we
should expect it to accelerate. So that would be my first question. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good afternoon, Adam. Look, the territories which we're listing on the slide, okay, you have to
look that we still very much focus the plans on the country, on the city. So it's not even on the entire territories. If I, to
give an example of Switzerland, right, because it's presumably might for some look like a slowdown in the penetration
of the growth of the market share.
I mean you have to really zoom what is happening in Geneva, Lausanne, Neuchâtel, tourism in a few places we're
really focused, okay. Some of those places IQOS is already above 3% or 4%. Some of the place, I think it's even closer
to the 6%. Obviously in these territories all together, including the villages, you have to look at the urbanization and
urbanization of Switzerland. I mean if this turns to the 0.9%, we're not worried about this at all. In every zooming
territory in which we are, we'll have a good trajectory. And therefore, the investment is behind the busy markets to have
a right base going forward.
Plus, also remember that we're expanding other territories which are noted in Europe, which are noted in this chart that
this obviously entails the additional spend. So I – and we don't read the chart in a way that Greece for, in my opinion,
has a very spectacular growth rate. And we know that Greece could have gone higher if it would allow Greece to
expand broader. So we just focusing on what we focusing. So it's good that there is growth.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Faster or slower, the same as 2%, 3% at which we think is the point from which the word of
mouth, et cetera, started help.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: So just to be clear, what you said about Switzerland, just zooming on with that. But in
Zurich and Geneva, we're accelerating up to, I don't know, 3% or 4%. But nonetheless, the rest of Switzerland is going
backward so fast that overall, the market share has only gone up 10 bps on a nationwide basis.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, I'm talking, no, I'm talking that the 42% weighted distribution on Switzerland, but the real
focus is on a few cities. And obviously through the distributions, when you have HeatSticks available in the stores, et
cetera, there's not much of the IQOS sales stuff support, okay. The focus is in the big cities, okay, relative to the size of
Switzerland. And therefore, if I look at the readings, as I said, in places like Lausanne, Geneva, a few others, I mean
they're pretty impressive. This is what it is.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Okay. Thank you. So moving on to the conventional business. In the past, you used to have
a target of 4% to 6% top line growth, sales growth, constant currency. This half, you've done minus 2%. You've
obviously said that it will accelerate a bit in the second half, helped by Indonesia in particular, but also Philippines for
example. The question is are you happy enough with the way the combustible business is going? Do you feel that you
are just happy to let it go at the current run rate, or do you think you need at all to increase investments there?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, we're happy with the progress we're making on a conventional business. I mean, those are
reasons why we're talking about the total revenue line and the combined volumes, et cetera. Because you'll have to now
factor back to the combustible business, the volumes and the margins and the revenues, which we're cannibalizing on
the way. Okay, so that's like the job. Am I happy with the development of pricing in Russia, clearly not, okay, so there's
no point. Are we happy that the consumer in Indonesia is a bit softer, obviously not. Am I happy that [ph] Mikey
(55:28) was not really playing fairly or fair in the market, no. So we always will have that sort of a situation.
But the way we'll look or handle that thing is actually if we can grow the revenue or deliver the pricing volume for the
six months at the 6%, despite the fact that we had these clear headwinds, that we can deliver the good quality in my
opinion, very good quality in my opinion, top-line growth of 7% or above for the full year, which is a nice mix now of
the pricing and the volume rather than just the pricing, which used to be a past algorithm. I am very pleased with this
development. I mean we are very much looking at the quality of the top-line growth. And you see this quarter and the
revenue at least, I mean and for the first time we're turning into a positive volume type of territory in terms of
contribution from IQOS.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: And then very quickly, any comments on the Platform 4 test in Birmingham? And do you
have anything new or specific you can say about the, I think it's going to be in 4Q of a Platform 2 test that you're
thinking about.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The old platforms, we said before, the 2 and 3 before the year-end should go to the test market.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: City test. Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes, city test market. And Platform 4, the product growth is now sharing the comments of the
feedback, which we get from the consumers in Birmingham, and is incorporating this feedback into the next version of
the product. This was the purpose of the test market.
I think the MESH delivered on what we wanted to deliver but also the test was to see what else we should add to the
product in terms of its performance, et cetera, to address spot-on the consumer needs. You will see that more of these
things that the test market is for the purpose of really verifying or realize what we need to do and then go back quickly
to the drawing board and follow up shortly with the new product release.
We somehow went through this very quickly in Japan. But people may not remember that the version of the IQOS
device which we have sold initially during the test market in Nagoya is a different product to product version which we
have nationally expanded. And it is a different product version what we are shipping to Japan right now. So Japan is
already at the current generation or release, if you like, of the devices, and they all incorporate the feedback from the

Our next question comes from Jon Leinster with Berenberg.
<Q - Jonathan Leinster>: Hi, gentlemen. Yes, no, a few questions, if I may. First of all, with regard to Japan, what
sort of inventory levels, trade inventory levels are there in terms of IQOS? And given your talk about still being sort of
capacity constrained and wanting to build out a supply chain and such, what level of inventory in a perfect world would
you be looking at in that sort of environment?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well usually we target the inventory in terms of a duration, right. So if I would compare the
duration of inventories of IQOS compared to what we strategically normally maintain for the conventionals, IQOS
would be below the conventional. So that's clearly the level of inventories which is not sufficient to maintain the
current of level of operation.
Now obviously on a conventional business in Japan, even before the opening of a new product category, the market is
in a secular decline rate, et cetera, so from time to time your inventories automatically have a longer duration if you
don't adjust the volume. IQOS is a reverse situation. I mean, as a result of, on a projected volume what we think is the
duration, and if I don't ship the product next week, the inventory is going to drop dramatically because I am only
increasing shipments to the retailer.
So our thinking is that we should end up in Japan with the inventories at minimum duration-wise at the level of a
conventional cigarette. And actually, if we could, we would like to build that inventory higher, because let us remember
that we still today have the one operation, one manufacturing center supplying the market. So our dependence from a
risk management perspective is extremely high, completely different than what we have on the conventional cigarette.
But we have said it already that Q1 that if we can build inventory in Japan, which will allow us to operate smoothly the
supply chain, we will do it this year.
<Q - Jonathan Leinster>: Sorry, you said 10 billion?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, I didn't say. No, I didn't say 10 billion.
<Q - Jonathan Leinster>: Sorry. Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, I was referring to the duration of inventories, okay.
<Q - Jonathan Leinster>: And what duration normally would there be on the FMC side then?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: You're talking somewhere between up to the three months, but you need to take into
consideration that the shipments to Japan are literally taking, are going by water. So your inventories are essentially on
the water. So two-thirds of that duration is not accessible for sales in Japan because it's in the pipeline to Japan. The
pattern which [indiscernible] (60:27).
<Q - Jonathan Leinster>: Okay. Okay. And in terms of capacity constraints, I mean, when we're into Q3, I mean I
think you're suggesting that you're still capacity constrained in terms of Japan. So does that mean you'll only come off
now in Q4?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we'll have increased sales and shipments to Japan because that capacity is, we're producing
more week-by-week and month-by-month. But what we said, that hopefully around Q4, we should be in that situations
that we can ship to the shops what is required and somehow in parallel get the inventory right which would absorb any

surge in demand, so we can lift the quota on the devices and Japan will not be a putting further constraint on the supply
chain.
<Q - Jonathan Leinster>: Right. And just in terms of the...
<A - Jacek Olczak>: [indiscernible] (62:28).
<Q - Jonathan Leinster>: Okay, gradually. I was going to say, in Japan in terms of the Marlboro price rise, I mean
clearly there was some there, that one of your competitors increased prices on one of its major brands last year, and
then there was not much of a response from anybody. And conversely in France, there's been a tax rise, but there's been
no increase in prices, including obviously Marlboro, which is the largest brand. I mean, can you explain first of all,
what's the theory behind moving the prices for Marlboro in Japan? And secondly, with regards to France, why has the
industry decided to simply absorb the tax?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Look, I mean the pricing decisions are made in our case country-by-country basis, so then I
wouldn't link that price development on our side in France to what we have done in Japan. We just think that taking
into considerations the market dynamics, the projected elasticities, et cetera, that we could increase the prices in Japan.
As you might have heard, the initial attempt towards the increase for more brands than just Marlboro, we ended up with
a Marlboro increase. So this is what it is.
And I have no clue whatsoever why the industry, as you phrase it, have decided not to pass on the tax in France. I can
speak for Philip Morris. Again, was the case in Italy very often, we look at tax structure. We look at the elasticities, and
we just run the numbers whether this makes sense or not, in the current configuration, to increase the prices from the
view of a growing profitability or just moving the pricing variance to the volume variance and vice-versa. That's the
situation.
Having said that, as you notice, despite the fact that we didn't have the pricing in France, there is no pricing still in
Japan, et cetera, we still had the 6% pricing variance for the six months of the year. So somehow we have to factor it
into our model.
<Q - Jonathan Leinster>: And just following on from that, in Japan you'd be quite happy if Marlboro is the only price
that went up?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we're always happy, if you like, the prices are going up.
<Q - Jonathan Leinster>: Yes. Okay, sorry, and very lastly, what do you think the total sort of conventional cigarette
volumes globally are likely to climb at this year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I guess somewhere this 2% to 3%. I mean, I don't think we would – if the Pakistan – you have to
now start factoring in this Russia. I think this 5% to 6% is about right. EU volume view which we have to forecast
should be around what we have said. I think Indonesia should now have a bit better volumes. The question is what's
going to continue to happen in Philippines, but we observed some relative moderations in the decline rates relative.
Pakistan, which is a big market, swinging the international volumes, I think it's 2%, 3% for the industry, seems like a
right number for the year.
<Q - Jonathan Leinster>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Yes. Hi. Good morning.

<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Yes. Right. Good morning. A couple of quick questions. The first, I read maybe your
general counsel is appearing before the FDA in light of the submissions. I'd love to have an update on the submissions,
their progress, and then what the steps might be for Altria under your agreement with them, what opportunities they
have to start to roll out IQOS? First question.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I guess you're referring to that Marc Firestone recent address with regards to illicit trade?
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes. Well, I mean, look, I mean, there are a number of countries which we see a pretty good
improvement on the illicit trade, but I think also Marc was trying to show our experiences how one can help in
collaborations in industry and the collaborations with the governments continue improving this trend.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: So and as I said, I mean, to follow up for a while, you see that over the last two, three years we've
made a pretty, I would argue, significant improvement with regards to illicit trade. There's still some pockets which
have to be addressed, but globally I think it's getting better. And with regards to Altria, I think Altria waits as we're
waiting for FDA pre-market approval authorization.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: [indiscernible] (67:41) and counting just in the calendar days, somewhere before the year-end, it
should happen. So Altria should be good to go to launch the product in the U.S. And I know from our collaborations
with Altria that Altria is working on the plans for this to happen. We're just waiting for FDA.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Great. Also, I read, Jacek, some place referenced to a new IQOS Heat cigarette
manufacturing facility authorized to get built in Germany. What is the timing of that and what's the capacity of that?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Production of Germany will add to the capacity beyond January 2019.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Oh, I see.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Our numbers for today, as we said, 50 are end installed this year. Plus/minus now the
productivity gains, which I highlighted in answers to the previous questions.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: This obviously may leave the 100 year-end installed capacity 2018, and Dresden facilities to start
contributing beyond. So this is our second, if you like, greenfield operations.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: After Bologna. In the meantime, we talk about Greece. We talk about Romania, et cetera, which
are the retrofitting or converting the conventional capacity into the RRP capacity.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Great. And then what happens in the capacity at launch for Dresden? How large would
that start and how it will grow over time?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well we'll build it to the appropriate level of capacity. That's all you can say.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Well, that's a good answer. Thank you. And then, who will supply the actual products
for the U.S. market?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Initially, PMI.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: And then, we'll have to see.
