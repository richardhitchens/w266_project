Well, as you can see, we wrapped up 2013 with another all-time record quarter. Union Pacific achieved our best-ever
quarterly earnings of $2.55 per share, an increase of 16% compared to 2012. For the first time in six quarters, we
reported overall volume growth despite significantly weaker coal shipments. It highlights the strength of our diverse
franchise, the extensive network reach we have to various markets and a strong grain harvest. When combined with
solid core pricing gains and our continued focus on safety, service and efficiency, we achieved a record fourth quarter
operating ratio of 65%, improving more than 2 points compared to 2012.
During the quarter, we battled some extreme winter weather that challenged us on many fronts but, as we've said
before, running a railroad is an outdoor sport, and we successfully worked through the challenges managing and
re-aligning our network resources to deliver on our customer commitments. All in, 2013 was another terrific year for
Union Pacific with our financial performance exceeding all previous milestones. It demonstrates our commitment to
delivering safe, efficient, high quality service that creates value for our customers and increased financial returns for
our shareholders. So, to kick us off this morning, I'm going to turn it over to Eric Butler. Eric?
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Jack. Good morning. In the fourth quarter, volume was up 2% compared to 2012 as the diversity of our
franchise provided enough growth opportunities to offset volume declines in two of the groups. We had strong gains in
ag, automotive and industrial products and intermodal also saw modest volume growth. This good news offset
continued weakness in coal and the slight decline in chemicals.
Core price improved 3.5% which combined with the benefit from positive mix produced a 5.5% improvement in
average revenue per car. Volume growth and the improved avenue revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue
up nearly 7.5% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.3 billion. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups.
Ag products grew 13%, which combined with 5% improvement in average revenue per car, drove revenue growth up
19%. A 41% increase in grain carloadings was driven by a strong harvest, as improved yields increased crop production
following last year's lower drought impacted volumes. With more competitive crop prices and strong global demand,
grain export volumes saw significant growth, up more than 90%. The strongest gains were in feed grain shipments to
the PNW and Mexico and wheat exports to the Gulf.
Also contributing to this growth was increased demand for domestic feed grains. Grain products volume was up 6%,
driven by a 21% increase in ethanol shipments as lower corn prices and increased gasoline consumption led refineries
to replenish low ethanol inventories. Shipments of DEGs also grew 19%, driven by stronger export demand primarily
by China.
Food and refrigerated shipments were down 4%. Gains in import beer were offset by declines in sugar volumes
following an unusually strong fourth quarter last year and a continued sugar surplus that reduced imports from Mexico.
Automotive volume grew 10%, which, combined with the 7% improvement in average revenue per car, produced a
17% increase in revenue. The same trends that supported growth throughout the year – replacement demand, low
interest rates, and favorable financing – continued through the fourth quarter. Aided by moderating fuel prices, demand
for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles gained momentum and the growth rate of the automotive industry outpaced
that of the overall economy.
UP finished vehicle shipments grew 7% as sales continued to grow with the seasonably adjusted annual sales rate
reaching 15.9 million units in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly level in six years. Parts volume increased 13%,
while pricing gains in the previously announced Pacer network, logistics management arrangement increased average
revenue per car. We now lap that arrangement on a year-over-year basis, so we won't see its positive ARC contribution
going forward.
Chemicals revenue grew by 3% as a 3% increase in average revenue per car more than offset a 1% decline in volume.
Industrial chemicals volume was up 6% driven by strength in end-user markets such as housing and automotive.
Increased demand in new business led to a 7% increase in petroleum products and LPG shipments.

Dampening the good news was the 22% decline in crude oil volume compared to the fourth quarter of last year. An
increased supply of crude at the Gulf Coast reduced Gulf prices, which led to a decline in shipments from West Texas
and Oklahoma. In addition, the discount of Louisiana Light Sweet to Brent displaced some of the Bakken crude
shipments away from Texas and Louisiana. Coal revenue declined 1%. Fourth quarter volume was down 10%, which
was mostly offset by a 10% improvement in average revenue per car.
You can see from the chart of weekly carloadings that unseasonably early snow impacted shipments from the southern
Powder River Basin in October with the tonnage down 12% for the fourth quarter. River infrastructure projects and low
water levels on the Ohio River curtailed barge traffic at St. Louis which also reduced shipments.
Also contributing to the decline were inventory management initiatives by select utilities and the continued impact of a
contract loss from the beginning of the year. Despite growth in West Coast exports, Colorado/Utah tonnage declined
10% based on soft domestic demand and mine production issues. Providing some good news, tonnage from other
coal-producing regions increased 10% from the relatively small base driven by gains from Southern Wyoming and
other regions.
In industrial products a 9% increase in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car produced revenue growth
of 14%. Non-metallic minerals volume was up 28% as continued growth in shale-related drilling, mainly in the Eagle
Ford and Permian Basins, increased frac shipments by 36%.
Metals volume was up 11%, driven by China bound iron ore shipments through ports in California and Mexico. We
also saw growth in pipe shipments with increased pipeline and drilling activity related to shale energy. Growth in
housing and home improvements continued to increase the demand for lumber with shipments up 6%.
Intermodal revenue was flat in the fourth quarter. Lower fuel surcharge revenue and unfavorable mix led to a 2%
decline in average revenue per unit, which offset volume growth of 2%. Our international intermodal volumes declined
1%, driven by continued market share shifts within the ocean carrier industry and increased port transloading activity.
We also saw a greater flow of revenue empty moves for international container repositioning, which impacted the
overall traffic mix for the quarter. Volume fared better for domestic intermodal where continued success converting
highway business to rail drove volume up 5%.
I'll close with a look at how we see our business shaping up for 2014. Our current outlook is for the economy to
continue its slow improvement. Our diverse franchise provides access to a number of markets with potential growth
opportunities. The new crop should provide opportunity for ag in the first half of the year with anticipated growth in
both domestic and export grain markets. Food and refrigerated is expected to see modest growth.
Automotive manufacturers expect sales growth to continue and Global Insight has raised its full year light vehicle sales
estimate to 16 million vehicles. This should be good news for our finished vehicles and auto parts business. Crude oil
spreads are growing crude supply and increased pipeline activity are expected to have a continued impact on our
crude-by-rail volumes. Most other chemicals markets should remain solid.
Turning to coal, the previously mentioned legacy contract loss will impact volumes, but low inventory levels and
increased exports should help offset this. Volume growth for the year will depend on weather conditions, economic
activity and natural gas prices. Industrial products should continue to benefit from shale-related activity with increased
drilling supporting growth in frac sand and pipe shipments. Housing starts are projected to exceed 1 million units for
the first time since 2007, which is expected to drive demand for lumber shipments.
Increases in commercial construction are expected to support growth in rock, metals and other highway-related
markets. Highway conversions should continue to drive growth in domestic intermodal. International intermodal may
be challenged in the first quarter by a difficult comparison to 2013, but an improving economy and strengthening
housing market should keep international intermodal ahead of last year.
For the full year, our strong value for our position and diverse franchise will again support business development
efforts across our broad portfolio of business. Across the groups, we'll continue to develop opportunities in Mexico,
where our unparalleled ability to link Mexico's economic growth with Europe's origins and destinations is the strength

of our franchise. Assuming the economy cooperates, we expect to deliver profitable revenue growth yet again in 2014
driven by modest volumes and core pricing gains. And with that, I'll turn it over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with our safety results. The 2013 reportable personal injury rate was up
slightly from our all-time record performance in 2012. Not shown is the number of severe injuries which declined to a
new record low. We focus our attention on risk and severity because these injuries have the greatest human and
financial impact. Our goal was for every employee to return home safely after every shift and we will get there using a
robust safety strategy that includes the Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture and risk identification and mitigation.
Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our full year reportable rate finished up 1% versus 2012. We
continue to make progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and root cause resolutions. In
addition, we continue to invest in capital to harden our infrastructure and leveraging advanced technologies to find and
fix track and equipment defects.
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 7% versus 2012, the result of our efforts to improve or close
high-risk crossings and to reinforce public awareness. Most encouraging was the 17% improvement on our Southern
Region, which has a higher grade crossing density than our overall network. While our reportable rate in both employee
and rail equipment safety increased slightly during 2013, the absolute number of incidents, which includes incidents
that do not meet the regulatory reportable threshold, declined in both categories.
Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient, particularly in the face of recent winter weather
challenges. Recall that in October, a winter blizzard in Wyoming severely impacted shipments out of the Powder River
Basin. In early December, we were hit with the most severe winter weather interruption in the past seven years. The
storm covered two-thirds of our network and generated a 33% increase in the number of days with major service
interruptions during the quarter. As a result, average train speed declined 3% in the fourth quarter, compared to 2012,
but remained within a solid service range.
These weather interruptions also drove a decline in our Service Delivery Index, the metric which gauges how well we
are meeting overall customer commitments, also reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced last year. We
continued to provide outstanding local service to our customers for the fourth quarter record 95.5% Industry Spot &
Pull, which measures the delivery or pulling of a car to or from a customer. Overall, our network remains
well-positioned to handle volume growth.
Moving on to network productivity, we continue to leverage existing resources as grain train lengths set a new
best-ever quarterly record, while automotive and manifest train lengths set new best-ever fourth quarter records.
Intermodal train size dropped, reflecting an increase in new service offerings. We expect these new trains to grow as
we convert business from the highway. Other efficiencies included a 2% improvement in locomotive productivity as
measured by gross ton-miles per horsepower day, in spite of a 2 point to 2.5 point headwind, due to the mix shift from
lower coal shipments to higher manifest shipments.
The improvement reflects a long-term trend of increasing locomotive reliability as well as effective utilization plans.
We efficiently handled the volume growth across each region of our network effectively utilizing our workforce. We
leveraged growing manifest volumes within UP's existing terminal infrastructure as reflected by an improvement in
cars switched per employee day. The improvement was particularly evident in our Southern Region, where cars
switched per employee day increased 5%. These productivity gains were generated by our men and women in the field
as they leveraged their expertise to improve safety, service and efficiency using the UP Way.
Moving on to our capital investments, we invested nearly $3.6 billion in our network during 2013, with more than $2.1
billion in replacement capital to harden our infrastructure and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. At the
end of the year, over 99% of our network was free of slow orders. Spending for service growth and productivity totaled
around $1 billion, driven by investments in capacity, commercial facilities and equipment.

Major projects included our $400 million investment in our Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility and more than $200
million of capacity work in the South to support our diverse and growing book of business in that region. In addition,
we invested another $420 million in Positive Train Control during the year, bringing our cumulative PTC investment to
$1.2 billion of our estimated $2 billion projected spend. Although it's unlikely the industry will meet the 2015 deadline,
we're making a good faith effort to do so and are working closely with regulators as we implement this new technology.
For 2014, our plan will likely exceed last year's spending. We'll continue to make capacity investments in our Southern
Region, while also advancing capacity projects across other parts of our network. Although some buckets will fluctuate
year-over-year, our core investment thesis will not, which is to maintain a safe, strong and resilient network and invest
in service growth and productivity projects that meet our aggressive return thresholds.
So in summary, we finished 2013 on a solid note, despite the winter weather challenges. As we move through 2014, our
focus above all will be the safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We'll take advantage of
growth opportunities by leveraging our network resources. We look to make productivity improvements in all areas,
utilizing resources more efficiently and investing capital productively. As a result, we'll provide customers with a value
proposition that supports growth with high levels of service. We call that moving our business up and to the right. All
combined, it translates into increased returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight
Thanks, Lance and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue grew 7% to
an all-time quarterly record of more than $5.6 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains and volume growth.
Operating expense totaled nearly $3.7 billion, increasing 4%. Operating income grew 14% to nearly $2 billion, also
hitting a best-ever quarterly mark.
Below the line, other income totaled $37 million, down $6 million compared to 2012. Interest expense of $127 million
was down slightly compared to the previous year. Income tax expense increased to $709 million, driven by higher
pre-tax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Net income grew 13% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance
declined 2% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce best-ever
quarterly earnings of $2.55 per share, up 16% versus 2012.
Turning to our top line. Freight revenue grew 7.5% to a quarterly record of $5.3 billion, driven by solid core pricing
gains of about 3.5%, which included a little over a point of legacy repricing. Volume growth of 2% and favorable mix
of a couple of points also contributed to the improvement. Growth in longer haul grain moves and a 5% increase in
higher average revenue per car manifest shipments drove the positive mix. These items were partially offset by growth
in lower average revenue per unit intermodal shipments.
Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2013. For the year, our core pricing gains ranged between
3.5% and 4%. Lost opportunity due to lower coal volumes totaled about 0.5% for the full year. This slide also shows
the quarterly rail inflation escalator excluding fuel on a year-over-year basis. As you can see, it drifted into negative
territory in the second half of 2013, creating a slight pricing headwind on the portion of our business, which is tied to
the escalator. Over the past five years, the cost escalator has averaged about 3%, but as we've discussed, we expect
2014 inflation to moderate. Negatively impacting our pricing gains, but also tempering operating expense increases.
As we have said previously, the more significant impact on our 2014 pricing will be the lack of about 1.5% of legacy
pricing benefit that we saw last year. That said, we remain committed to our strategy of pricing for re-investability. It's
supported by the value we create for our customers and is required to generate the returns needed for continued
investment in our franchise.
Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which
increased 7% compared to 2012. Inflationary pressures, volume-related expenses and a mix shift to more manifest
traffic drove the increase. In addition, higher overtime and recrew expenses driven by severe winter weather masked

overall productivity gains. You also need to take into account the $20 million payroll tax refund included in our 2012
fourth quarter results. Excluding this one-time item, our comp and benefit expense was up about 4.5%. Workforce
levels were flat for the quarter as we leveraged a 2% volume increase, with a 1% increase in TE&Y employees. Fewer
capital employees offset the TE&Y workforce increase.
As we look at 2014 we expect our comp and benefits expense to grow, however, the extent will be driven by volume
levels and business mix. The good news story is our continued productivity initiatives that will help mitigate these
increases. In addition, we'll continue to see labor inflation this year but it will likely moderate to below the 2% mark.
Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $905 million, decreasing 2% versus 2012, driven by a lower average
diesel fuel price. On the flip side, gross ton-miles increased 2% in the wake of strong grain shipments while our fuel
consumption rate increased 1% compared to 2012.
Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 10% to $585 million,
due to higher locomotive and freight car repair expenses and an increase in joint facility maintenance expense, and we
continued to incur management fees associated with the 2012 Pacer agreement, which are recouped in our automotive
freight revenue line. And as Eric mentioned, we've now lapped that contract on a year-over-year basis, so we won't see
that variance going forward.
Depreciation expense was $458 million, up 1% compared to 2012. The impact of increased capital spending in recent
years was mostly offset by an equipment rate study that went into effect in 2013. For 2014, we expect depreciation
expense to increase at a more normalized rate likely in the 6 to 7% range. This range includes about $80 million of
depreciation expense associated with Positive Train Control, capital investments. I'll talk more about PTC in a minute.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $311 million,
up 3% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses associated with the Pacer contract and growth in agricultural
and automotive shipments mainly drove higher freight car rental expense. Other expenses came in at $188 million, up
$6 million versus last year. Higher property taxes and freight and equipment damage costs drove expenses up compared
to 2012. A reduction in personal injury expense and effective cost control measures partially offset these increases. For
2014, we expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% for the full year excluding any unusual items.
Turning to our operating ratio performance. Our focus on pricing the business right and moving it efficiently continues
to pay off. We achieved a record fourth quarter operating ratio of 65%, improving 2.1 points compared to 2012. On a
full-year basis, we also made tremendous strides by generating a best-ever operating ratio of 66.1%. It clearly illustrates
the strength in value proposition of the Union Pacific franchise. We've talked about our focus on continued core pricing
and productivity gains and leveraging what we see as modest volume growth over our planning horizon.
On the cost side, it's a matter of effectively managing inflationary pressures in addition to other cost hurdles that we
have every year. For example, operating taxes that we pay will continue to increase as our profitability grows.
Depreciation expense is another item that will continue to increase, assuming a growing capital spend. And as we've
discussed, depreciation and other operating expenses will be driven higher by shorter life, Positive Train Control assets
and maintenance costs as we move further into that project.
Despite these obstacles, we feel very good about our prospects of now achieving our sub-65% operating ratio before
2017. Exactly how much sooner before 2017 will depend on the usual drivers: economic growth, fuel prices,
inflationary hurdles, just to name a few. That said, we're equally focused on cash generation and improving our overall
financial returns.
Slide 27 provides a summary of our 2013 earnings with a full year income statement. I'll walk through a few of the
highlights from our record-setting year. Operating revenue grew more than $1 billion to an all-time record of nearly
$22 billion. Operating income also set a new best-ever mark of $7.4 billion, topping 2012's record by 10%. And net
income of $4.4 billion and earnings of $9.42 per share, also set new full-year records.
Overall, one of the key measure for our performance is the cash that we generate. In 2013, cash from operations
increased to $6.8 billion, up 11% compared to 2012. After $3.5 billion in cash capital investments and $1.3 billion of

dividend payments, our free cash flow totaled nearly $2.1 billion, being the first rail to surpass the $2 billion mark in
our industry's history.
Taking a closer look at 2014, we will not see the benefit of bonus depreciation. In fact, we'll see a headwind to free
cash flow of about $400 million due to tax payments associated with prior year programs. However, we don't expect
this to impact our cash allocation strategy or our ability to grow shareholder returns.
Slide 29 shows our 2013 all-in capital investments of $3.6 billion. It's a bit higher than our cash capital due to capital
leasing activity and other non-cash capital items. In 2014, we expect to increase our capital spending from 2013's
levels, pending final approval from our board of directors in February.
The chart on the right reflects our achievements in generating returns on these investments. Return on invested capital
was a record 14.7% in 2013, up 0.7 points from 2012. If you calculate it on a replacement basis, our return shrinks to
about half that number. Returns must continue to improve to support asset replacement costs and investments required
to achieve our safety, service and growth initiatives.
Beyond funding our capital commitments, our record profitability and strong cash generation have enabled us to grow
shareholder returns. After increasing our quarterly dividend per share 15% in 2012, we raised it an additional 14.5%
last year. For 2013, we achieved a payout ratio of 31.5%, up from 30% in 2012. We're making good progress in
moving up within our targeted payout range of 30% to 35%. In addition, we continue to make opportunistic share
repurchases which play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation.
In the fourth quarter, we bought back more than 4.9 million shares totaling $786 million. Full year purchases topped
more than 14.5 million shares totaling over $2.2 billion, up 50% from 2012. Our new repurchase authorization of up to
60 million shares over a four-year time period, went into effect January 1 of this year. Combining dividend payments
and share repurchases, we returned over $3.5 billion to our shareholders in 2013. It represents a 36% increase over
2012, clearly demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.
Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our ongoing commitment to a solid investment grade credit rating.
Continued growth in earnings and cash flow has improved our 2013 year-end debt-to-cap ratio to roughly 38% and our
debt-to-EBITDA to just under 1.4 times, even with the addition of nearly $600 million of balance sheet debt since last
year. As we've said, these metrics are a little lower than where we believe they need to be. We are targeting about 1.5
times and around a 40% for year-end 2014, which is closer to the low 40s target range that we've previously discussed.
Our $1 billion debt issuance earlier this month was a good step in that direction.
So that's a recap of our fourth quarter and full-year results. As we focus on 2014, we're projecting another record
financial year if the economy cooperates. In addition to our pricing initiatives and ongoing productivity gains, volume
leverage opportunities should also help drive continued margin improvement. And as Eric just highlighted, we have
growth opportunities across a variety of market sectors that should drive modest volume growth for the full year.
First quarter volumes also are expected to be on the positive side of the ledger, driven by continued strong growth in
grain shipments, cross-border traffic with Mexico, and various other industrial-related moves. Our coal business is a
little more difficult to predict. The lost legacy business creates about a 2% headwind on our coal volumes in 2014. But
as always, weather and the economy will be the driving factors for our coal business this year.
We feel very good about our outlook as we move forward. Our fundamentals are strong supported by a diverse
franchise that allows us to pursue new attractive market opportunities. We'll continue to move the ball forward,
focusing on improved returns to support capital investments that will strengthen and enhance our network, great value
for our customers and drive increased return for our shareholders.

Thanks, Rob. So as we look at 2014, we see the economy as slowly strengthening. We're well-positioned for economic
growth and are confident in our ability to deliver on our customers' growing transportation needs. Excellent service is
key to our future success. It supports our pricing initiatives and improves network and asset utilization. It also
demonstrates the power of our value proposition to new customers that are looking for viable transportation
alternatives.
Our capital investment strategy will be another key part of UP's success going forward. We are making investments
today building the capacity that we need for tomorrow. Longer term, we remain bullish on our future prospects. We'll
continue our unrelenting focus on both safety and service to our customers. We strongly believe in the power and the
potential of the Union Pacific franchise to drive even greater financial performance and shareholder returns in the years
to come.
So, with that, let's open it up to your questions.

Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is
from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Good morning and congratulations on the strong results throughout the year.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Thanks, Tom.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Wanted to see if you could give a little more flavor on the coal outlook. I know you've
got this 2 percentage point headwind from the lost contract, but it just seems like we're having pretty favorable weather
impact in terms of the cold winter. You said some of your customers had already taken actions to reduce inventory. So
maybe if you could give us a comment on where inventories are and whether you've seen some signs that maybe
customers are looking to take more coal given what appears to be a little better weather pattern.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Tom, as you know, our coal volumes are really driven by economic activity, both on the
industrial side and the consumer side. Certainly weather patterns, particularly cold, particularly hot weather will drive
that. Natural gas prices will drive that. If you look at the last 30 days, certainly those items seem to suggest stronger
coal outlook. But as you know, all of those items could move around month to month, quarter to quarter, and overall
coal market share still is hanging in there around 39%. It's been pretty, pretty static. So, the outlook drivers will be
exactly what we said, economic activity, weather patterns, natural gas prices, and I'm not sure we have any special
ability to predict that better than anybody else.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And the latest numbers, the ten days is from what? November? Down ten days Southern
Powder River Basin. So, it will be interesting to see how the December numbers play out.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Jack, where do you think stockpiles are right now? Are they...
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Tom, the last report we saw was November data that said Southern Powder River Basin
stockpiles were down about ten days. So that would put it somewhere around 60 days.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: And that's pretty close to target?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: It's actually a little bit below target for this time of the year.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: A little bit below target. Okay, and then the follow-up question, you know it seems like
you've had some recent favorable data points from a couple of truckload carriers. It feels like that market's improving
and maybe tightening a little bit. If you look at the velocity numbers for your primary rail competitor, for Burlington

Northern, it seems like they've had some challenges maybe with capacity that their velocity's been down, and it feels
like you're maybe shaping up to have a cyclical or capacity-driven improvement in pricing if you look into 2014. I
guess that assumes the economy improves. I was wondering if you could offer a thought if that's a reasonable way to
look at it that pricing might improve if you see the economy develop some momentum.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Tom, as you said it feels like the economy's slowly strengthening and our competitor you made
reference to, they're a good company. Certainly, we all have had challenges in the past and we assume they'll work
through those. Our focus is really on driving our business development opportunities. We have a great service value
proposition. We're growing our business development as we said, our domestic intermodal. I think this is the fifth
record year of our domestic intermodal so we continue to feel pretty good about our outlook and our opportunities in
that space.

Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, good morning, guys. I'm just thinking about the long-term guidance and the
sub-65% OR by 2017 and we had a pretty good year this year with the economy. You guys had a record year in terms
of your earnings and results and we improved our operating ratio by 170 basis points or so. I mean, just extrapolating,
you had coal down 9% this year. If coal is slightly better than that, besides the fact that you've got this headwind from
the legacy side, what else makes you hesitant to say, yeah, we can probably at least hit that 65% target next year?
From my standpoint, that guidance feels wildly conservative and I'm trying to figure out what the X factor is. To me,
it's coal because you've got that double levered impact from a pricing standpoint, but if I had to think about the bias, it
feels it's to the positive there. So when you're sitting down and putting pen to paper on that, how are you guys thinking
about that?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Okay. Rob, why don't you take a shot at that?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Justin, as you've heard me say many, many times. We're not going to slow down to
get to the target at a later date and time and I hope you're right with everything you've said, that we're going to get there
as efficiently and aggressively as we can, as we have over the last milestones that we've set. And as I cautioned, things
that we are mindful of are mix impacts driven by the economy, weather, fuel. Those are all factors that go into it. So
we'll see how it all plays out and I hope you're right and we're certainly going to take advantage and leverage every
opportunity we have to get there as efficiently and as soon as we can.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Fair enough. When it comes to the share buybacks and the pace, obviously 60 million
shares, nice amount of capital to potentially deploy there. I think you guys laid out some slightly more aggressive
balance sheet goals for this year. Now, how confident do you feel around getting to those balance sheet targets and
when I think about the potential for going past those, are those hard stops or is that kind of fungible based to what
you've seen from the environment and obviously those ratios move with what your capital looks like? So trying to get a
sense of that.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Go ahead, Rob.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Justin, also as you've heard us say many times we are going to continue to be
opportunistic in our share buybacks. I think you saw that in the fourth quarter where the pace was quite strong. I think
our 60 million over a four-year period new program shows our confidence over the long term. It all starts with
generating the cash on the front end and that's our primary focus is to do that to enable us to continue to have the

opportunities to invest in the business where it makes sense; where the returns are there, continue to raise the dividend;
and continue to have an aggressive buyback program.
In terms of the targets, I've said many times it's not how we necessarily build it, but we're looking at that low 40%s
debt-to-cap range and there's a hard number there, but that low 40%s feels good to us and we plan on moving in that
direction.

Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Thank you. With respect to crude-by-rail, obviously, we've seen Bakken
and West Texas moves falling off here, but as we think about 2014 and volume growth in crude, are you expecting
some year-over-year growth, given that you do have exposure to areas like the Niobrara and the Uinta, and that in
addition to some origination and destination facilities coming online to support some of the heavy Canadian crude
moving down to the Gulf. So I was wondering if you could opine on that.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Alison, as we've said before, a core part of our strategy is as you suggest strengthening
destination facilities, identifying places where crude can land, identifying places where we can strengthen originations,
whether with rail partners or of our own accord. So that's a core part of our strategy. We're going to continue to do that.
In some parts of the country, there are clearly lots of environmental and other processes that you have to go through to
get new facilities up and running and so there probably are not a significant number of new facilities that will
physically be coming online in 2014, but that is a core part of our strategy to basically strengthen facilities.
Having said that, we acknowledge and recognize that really where and when and how crude flows between the various
shale plays and the various destination regions really are fundamentally going to be driven by the market and spreads,
and we have probably no greater ability to predict that than anyone else.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. So it's a little bit unclear at this point whether or not you'll see volume growth this
year? Is that fair?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: We're going to have to just wait and see as we look at what happens to the spreads in the
market. We're excited there's a couple of California destinations that are supposed to come online. We have to wait and
see how that is going to play out in terms of the permitting process, as Eric said. There's a lot of moving parts to this
one, so.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Got it. Okay. On the intermodal side, can you give us a sense of how much of a volume
uplift that you might see on the domestic side from the opening of the Santa Teresa facility and some of the new
services that you recently announced with Ferromex going to Chicago and then the service from Laredo to Memphis.
How much do you think that this could add to volume growth?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Well, Alison, we're probably not going to give you the number you're looking for. We're not
going to give guidance specifically on it, but we're pretty excited about opening the facility. The intermodal piece will
open around April 1. So we'll transfer our current El Paso book of business over and we've already started the
marketing and the business development efforts in Northern Mexico, the maquiladoras regions of Mexico and those
places to start bringing product online. We're seeing nice growth in our Eagle Premium Service and our service from
Laredo into the Southeast, and we think that's going to continue to help us develop and fill out our intermodal franchise
in 2014. Eric, do you have anything else to add to that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: No, that's it. As you said, we're excited about it. We think we got a great franchise and we're
excited about the opportunities.

Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: For you, Rob, I just want to make sure. Did I hear you right that excluding legacy, the core
price got a little bit better in fourth quarter? I just wasn't sure I heard that right. And then when I think about mix, so a
real nice mix helping in the fourth quarter. How much of that do you think is grain and, if a lot of it's grain, should we
think about that mix help continuing for the first, I'd say, two or three quarters of 2014?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Scott, just I think the way to look at the legacy, I wouldn't read too much into that. I
think it was about 1.5% impact throughout the year of 2013. So that's probably a safe number to continue to think
about.
In terms of mix, Scott, as you know, it's difficult and we don't give guidance on mix but if strong long haul grain
shipments are stronger this year, which certainly that'd be a plus that, in and of itself, would have a positive impact on
mix. There are other moving parts, as you know, but it's why we shy away from giving mix guidance because there's so
many moving parts, but that would be a net positive.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay, and then I want to take Justin's question and focus it maybe a little bit more on 2014
and, Rob, in your margin views. So I think we all get less legacy this year, but to Justin's point, coal should be certainly
not down 9% and hopefully positive. You talked about less cost inflation. Just directionally, are there other things we
should be thinking about why margins improvement in 2014 can't be similar to what we saw in 2013, or do you think
the lack of legacy is just so powerful that that's an unreasonable expectation.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: No. Scott, actually, you know what, what I'm just saying is is that there's a lot – the same
moving parts that we've had for the last ten years, we're going to have those same moving parts as we look forward, and
that's going to be the economy, the impact of fuel, the impact of mix on our business. So the higher depreciation rates
that I guided you, those are all factors, but don't read that to think that we've kind of lost our enthusiasm to continue to
move the ball forward on being aggressive in improving our margins and we hope the stars are aligned and we will be
able to leverage each of those opportunities as we continue to make progress.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I would also just call to everybody's attention that we just proved in the last two years the
impact weather can have on the grain harvest and it can be pretty dramatic from year to year. So, again, all of those
things kind of enter the picture.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: All right. Thanks, guys.

Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just picking up on thoughts around the buyback when you
think about 2014 or I guess the next couple of quarters. Is there any sort of major puts or takes we should be thinking
about that would potentially lead to an acceleration or a deceleration of the pace of purchases versus where you were in
the fourth quarter? I guess with some of your targets about 2014, I just want to get a rough sense. Is that sort of the
right run rate to be thinking about over the course of the next year or so?

<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Chris, no. As you've heard me say many times, we've been reluctant to give any kind
of a run rate or guidance on that. The common theme will be we will continue to generate a strong cash position as we
can and we will continue to be opportunistic in our share buybacks.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. But no real sort of thinking dynamic. It's just going to be an opportunistic type of
decision on that.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. And then, Eric, a quick question for you. Just when you think about the international
intermodal, I know there's been port changes among some of your customers and so when I think about that in 2014, do
you have a point in sort of the second quarter or so when you begin to lap some of those differences where you start to
see some of that international volume pick back up just on the back of easier comps?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. As we said, we're going to have some difficult comps in the first quarter just because first
quarter 2013 was so strong for us. As you know, steam ship carriers are constantly looking at ports and the ports that
we have access to is still a strong part of their portfolio and there will be economic drivers but we don't think that
there's any particular specific port-driven drivers that you'll see that will change the volume outlook in the latter half of
the year.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay, great. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Lance, I wanted to ask you a question. With expectations for volume growth here
for the first time in about 2 1/2 years, does that make the efficiency opportunity that more easy to capture or does it
drive some complications with adding capacity and adding workforce to handle the new volume?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Well, thanks for the question. We love volume growth. It does present opportunities for
generating productivity both in network yards and online, the road and train size. Many other areas. We are
well-prepared for it. I wouldn't categorize capital investment as a challenge. I'd categorize that as another opportunity
and one that we love to embrace because right now we're generating pretty attractive returns on those investments. So
we're in pretty good shape for the growth that we see coming forward.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: But is it possible that with the expansion this year, the efficiencies are even more
visible?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I wouldn't say that. I don't think we can commit to that. I think that we can commit to what Rob
has said, which is we pursue productivity regardless of the environment and our track record is such that we generate
productivity.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Thank you, and Rob, I want to follow up on that too. With compensation and
benefits, you did say you're going to have lower inflation hurdles this year. Can we talk about some of the drivers from
a head count perspective and an inflation perspective for that line?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, let me start with the expected employment numbers. I mean that, as we've always
said, will depend on what volume is. We would expect that if volume increases, our overall head count will increase
but not one for one because, obviously, there is productivity that we are able to achieve. And that excludes any capital
head count is sort of our – to run our railroad.

On the inflation side, yes, as I pointed out in my comments, we do expect 2014 inflationary pressures to moderate. And
we see that on the labor line at around 2% or so all in, driven by some health and welfare positive news in our overall
inflationary expectations and pension is a part of that.

And the next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Jack, maybe just your thoughts on returns and the Surface
Transportation Board, particularly with two relatively new commissioners, your thoughts on being the top rail
generating the highest returns relative to their cost formula. Your needs are on replacement rate returns now given
Mulvey's retirement. Maybe you can give us some thoughts on that.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure, Ken. You know what, we're looking at this as an opportunity. We'll certainly do
everything we can to help educate the new members and make sure that they understand the dynamics. It's taken us a
long time, for not only Union Pacific but other railroads, to get to a revenue adequacy point of view and when you get
there, that's not the end of the game. That's not the goal because the whole issue of replacement cost still has to be dealt
with. It still has to be brought into the picture. And so, therefore, as we look at it, we're not afraid of it. We're ready to
engage and we don't see, at this point and time, any negative consequences of changing out the STB members.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Okay, and then just similarly, maybe it's more for Eric but on all the comments noting the
economy is accelerating. I guess where do you see it hitting in terms of volumes and relative, I guess, specifically or
maybe it's a Lance question, on how much capacity you see in the network right now.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I think we're just going to leave it, Ken, with Rob's comment which is we expect volumes to
be positive this year and how positive is really going to depend – we're sitting here on January 23. There's a lot of year
to play out. So, we'll see. We are optimistic at this point in time that the economy does appear to be strengthening as we
go forward. We like the prospects of having a strong grain harvest to kick the year off for us and hope that the second
half is just as good.
We're watching the coal burn just like you guys all are in terms of what's happening on weather conditions and the
economic activity to drive further consumption and the natural gas prices. So there's a lot of things right now and if we
can go through the year without a lot of government interference from debt ceilings and budget bills and those kinds of
things, we could have a fairly decent year but we're certainly not afraid of the volume in any shape or form.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Just a technical question, if I can then. When does the coal contract comp against itself?
The lost contract? Is that the end of 1Q?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Start of the year, Ken.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Start of the year. Okay.

<Q - Bill J. Greene>: I'm curious on pricing if we can come back to that and if we look at your outlook for the
economy, how long in your experience in the past has it been before strong volume, strong economy, tighter markets
start to allow the rail market to price up? We've obviously had all of that legacy business but just more from an
underlying organic pricing standpoint, how long does that take typically?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Overall, Bill, we're not going to get much into a discussion on pricing here. I will just tell
you that as we look across our markets at all times, every market is different so the pricing opportunities ebb and flow
with each individual markets. And I don't know, Eric, do you have any other insight?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I would just say what Rob has continually said in the past. As we've reported price, the majority
of our price has been non-legacy pricing. So I don't think it's an assumption that it's new.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: We'll watch each market carefully and our goal is always to price the market.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Can you remind us the percent of business that's tied to RCAF?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Bill, for competitive reasons, we don't share that number. It's a fraction of our business. It's
certainly not the majority but that's a piece of information that we have not publicly shared.

we don't typically break it out. You operate outdoors obviously. But given what you've seen so far, is it going to be a
material impact in the first quarter based on what you know today?

Our next question is from David Vernon of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hi. Good morning. Eric, a question for you on safety regulations with respect to crude.
Obviously, if you get more stringent tank car standards you might see a volume impact but I was wondering how you
might think that would impact your ability to price because presumably, those oil spreads would widen a little bit if
some capacity was taken out of the system and maybe you could get a little opportunity to price that business a little
more. Is that the right way to think about it or how have you guys been thinking about it?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. So, David, I'm going to let Lance talk about the safety-related issues but, as we say,
we really don't talk publicly about pricing strategies. We would assume that if there's a safety mandate that has a higher
cost or price car associated with it, that would be reflected in the supply chain associated with moving crude-by-rail.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: And I'm not sure that there was a question in there on safety and crude-by-rail but.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Well, I mean I guess would you think that some of the regulations would pull some
capacity out of the crude-by-rail marketplace?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I don't think we can comment on that. The things that are being discussed are the tank car
standards. That's really driven by the DOT and PHMSA. We already treat crude oil trains in a fashion that's over and

above what's required by regs in terms of keeping our communities safe. So, I don't think I'd comment on that.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. Thanks and then maybe, Eric, maybe just a quick follow-up on automotive.
Given the sourcing shift towards Mexico and your greater share of that market, is it right to think that the volume could
be a little bit better than light vehicle sales on an ongoing basis? Or how long do you think you might be able to keep
that better than light vehicle sale growth in volumes for automotive going?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, so in terms of the Mexico manufactured automotive market, there are a lot of new
facilities coming online in the next several years that will grow the production in Mexico from roughly 3 million
vehicles a year today to 4 million vehicles a year if you go out several years from now. We, with our franchise,
continue to expect to get our fair share of that in terms of shipping those vehicles to market, but whatever vehicles are
manufactured in Mexico will, of necessity, have to displace vehicles manufactured elsewhere unless the total sales
number's going up.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. And do you think you guys might get a little bit better share of that if it was
like an eastern facility moving down south or a Canadian facility moving south?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Not quite sure of the question but clearly as sales increase for the industry, given our strong
Mexico franchise, we expect to get our fair share of that growth.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right, thanks for the time.

Thank you. Our next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up here on pricing. I just wanted
to check if my math is right here. If I just average out your core pricing over the year, you're about 3.75% you said
about a point-and-a-half of that is due to legacy. So if we strip that out, you're down to about 2.25%. You indicated that
lower inflation would pressure the average price down. So if I exclude fuel surcharge and exclude mix, are we looking
at below 2% core price for next year? Is my math correct there in interpreting what you said or is there something I'm
missing there?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Walter, as you know, we don't give pricing guidance and we're not [ph] getting (58:45)
other than that we're focused on it. We price per value. We're confident in our ability to get re-investable pricing and
above inflation. We also have commented that we won't get the turbo charge, if you will, over the point-and-a-half on
legacy and that we will feel a little bit of the pressure on the moderating inflationary pressures for those contracts that
have that index. Beyond that, we haven't given commentary on our pricing other than to say that we're going to
continue to provide a good, safe service to our customers and continue to look for opportunities to price to value and
then continue to achieve core pricing in our business.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. Just sticking on pricing here on the yield side with ag, obviously, as volume is coming
back, it is affecting your average yield. Is the fourth quarter rate, whether we use it on a per carload basis, or should it
continue to move or is that fourth quarter rate a fairly decent rate to use as we look at 2014?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Certainly, as we are continuing out the crop year, which kind of goes through the mid part of the
second quarter, you would probably see similar trends as what we've seen in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Got it.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: The further out that you look, it certainly depends on the crop year for next year, the weather
and the size of the crop that you get beyond that.

<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Yeah. Got it. Okay. And just a technical question perhaps for Lance. Headcount, how do you
see that evolving? Is that something that changes directly with volume or do you see some synergy opportunities here
that you can maybe move head count a little less in volume this year?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, our intent is to always move head count less than the growth rates and volume and that's
what we'd anticipate doing.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Is flat a good number to put in for now or
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: We won't make any [indiscernible] (01:00:45).
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I hope not. I hope we grow more than that.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Yeah. Okay. All right. I hope so too. That's great. Okay. Thanks very much. That's all my
questions.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stevens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks and good morning. When you gave your long-term OR guidance, you talked about
averaging about 50% incremental margins along the way. The last two years we've been well above that level. Clearly a
big piece of this is due to the top-line growth being more driven or driven more by RPU as volumes have been slightly
down. But headed into the next couple of years, if we see volumes start to drive a larger percentage of your top-line
growth, is it fair to say we see incremental margins trend closer to that 50% or maybe even a little bit below?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Justin, all those are factors that go into what it ultimately will be but I haven't changed our
view in terms of needing to achieve, as kind of a rough target, that 50% incremental margin on our growth as we look
forward. So how we get there will depend on mix, will depend on fuel prices, will depend on a lot of things but that's
still our focus.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow up, I wanted to ask about Intermodal pricing and your
expectations in 2014. Do you think we could see an acceleration versus the trends we've seen in the last year or is your
expectation that it continues to be a pretty competitive pricing environment?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: So from an industry standpoint – and I'm not making any reference to UP, but from an
industry standpoint, it's still a competitive industry. The international intermodal industry has surplus capacity with all
of the steamship carriers coming on. The domestic intermodal industry, it's a huge opportunity but got a lot effective
competitors. It is a competitive environment.
<Q - Justin Long>: And do you think that XPO's acquisition of Pacer will have any impact of your business and,
overall, as you look at your IMC partners, is there a possibility we see any changes or shifts in the next year or two?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: XPO's acquisition of Pacer, from our perspective, we think is a good deal for XPO and
Pacer and our business relationships with them and we expect that to be positive for us. In terms of the other IMCs in
the industry, there's always a lot of moving parts. Our approach is to have business relationships with a wide swath of
the IMCs and we'll continue to do that.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate the time.

Thank you. As a reminder, due to the number of analysts joining us today, we're limiting everyone to one primary
question and one follow-up to accommodate as many as possible. The next question comes from the line of Matt Troy
with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matthew Troy>: Thanks. Question for Rob. Just one, specifically as it relates to Mexico. I know the focus
historically has been on intermodal and automotive when we go through the talking points on growth, but you
obviously have a movement afoot down there legislatively to open up natural resource extraction opportunities to
foreign investment. You're on the board of the venture down there. I was wondering, Rob, if you could just give us an
update on the legislative pathway down there, perhaps the commercial opportunity in energy trans-border with Mexico
and realistically what kind of timeframe we might start to think about as that develops into a real, viable commercial
opportunity for UP. Thanks.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Matt. Jack and I are both on the FXE board and for those of you who may not be as
close to it, we own 26% of interest. I think everybody's excited about what's happening down in Mexico on multiple
fronts but specifically to the energy reform, I think there probably are a lot of bases yet to be tagged and a lot of
progress yet to be made. So I don't think it's necessarily a this year kind of activity, but it's probably several years out
yet before you actually see it start to take hold but, nonetheless, it's a great opportunity for us and our partner.
<Q - Matthew Troy>: Looking forward to it. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Good morning. How much did your cross-border traffic grow last year?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Don't have the exact number off the top of my head but I believe it was about 10%.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: 10%, isn't it?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. [Inaudible] (01:05:16)
<A - John J. Koraleski>: 10% first year, over $2 billion of revenue.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. Great. And then as that traffic grows, what impact is it going to have on length of haul and to
average intermodal ARPUs?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: No. We measure length of haul from the border. So I don't think it'll have a material impact in
terms of on length of haul metrics.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And that 10% growth, by the way, was in the fourth quarter, just to be clear.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. Great. And then just a last follow-up on that. Can you give us a sense of the incremental
margin from cross border versus the overall franchise?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Matt, this is Rob. Yeah. We don't break it out that way. I mean it's good business for us but I
wouldn't look at it as materially different from our base business. But that's not something we don't break it out that
way.

Your next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much and good morning.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hi.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: I wanted to ask one on the international intermodal business. Looks like we'll get some
carrier consolidation this year with the new alliance, potentially a big merger. What if anything do you think that means
for the business in general and your franchise specifically?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. As I was saying, our assessment is that there's a significant overcapacity in the steamship
industry today and short of worldwide improvement in industrial production that consumes that capacity, they'll need to
have something done to absorb that capacity. So, there are a lot of conversations going on, as you mentioned. I'm not
sure we have any particular insight or a perspective beyond what's out there in the marketplace.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Okay, and then one question on operations. For most of 2013, your growth was very
biased towards your Southern Region and to your manifest traffic in particular. So that was a challenge that you were
dealing with. Does that trend persist in 2014 or is that dynamic starting to level out a little bit?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I don't think we comment on where exactly volume's going, but I will say that the South has
done a stellar job stepping up to that volume increase and actually, I would welcome continuing to see that trend. It
would leverage the capital investment we've been putting down there and leverage the process improvements that our
team has put in place. I'm really pretty excited about that.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: All right. That's all for me. Thank you.

The next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Question for Rob. We were wondering if
you had a message embedded in your use of the phrase pricing for re-investability instead of the phrase that perhaps has
been used more historically, inflation-plus pricing? Is there a nuanced meaning to that?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: No, John, in fact, I've used that terminology actually for several years. Basically, what we're
saying is, at a minimum, something has to be able to be priced at a re-investable level. We price to market and we're
confident when you add it all up that that's above inflation.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Our long-term goal, John – we started this a long time ago, was to say that every carload of
freight that moves on the Union Pacific meets our re-investability threshold. So, that's kind of like an entry level as we
look at pricing opportunities and that's why, in some cases, our volume growth hasn't been quite as strong because
we're being relatively selective in terms of what business does move on our franchise.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: I got it. Thanks very much. And then just as a follow-on perhaps for Lance. As you've gotten
deeper into the PTC project, I know initially there were thoughts that there weren't a lot of economic benefits
associated with it, but as you've gotten deeper into it, do you think there are some operational improvements that could
be driven out of the data incapabilities that will be embedded in the PTC system once it's fully operational?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So, John, this is how we think about PTC. The first is I'm very proud of our team and our
industry for driving that project to a point where now I can see. I believe it's going to be successful and we're going to
have put in place a significant, maybe the industry's most significant technological advancement in a relatively short
period of time. All PTC does is overlay on your existing system and stop trains for four reasons.
So, PTC on its own and the technology that we're investing right now on its own does not enhance operations. It is a
safety enhancement and I applaud that. Having said that also, the technology that's embedded in PTC might form a
foundation for future investments that could be helpful, but that's over and above the investments that we're making

The next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. Rob mentioned fuel as a potential speed bump on the path to the OR target. But
are there still any major fuel efficiency levers in reserve like broader distributed power or more full implementation of
throttle technology?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. Could you repeat that question, please, for me?
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Sure, Lance. I guess I'm asking, given the importance of fuel, are there still major levers
to pull like broader implementation of throttle technology or more use of distributed power.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, absolutely there are. We're pretty deeply penetrated on DPU but every unit that we buy is
DPU-equipped and so we'll continue to be able to penetrate parts of our network and train service that aren't currently
DPUed, so that's always a benefit and a plus, and in terms of other technologies we are actually deploying two different
types of technology that will benefit in fuel consumption rate across the network. We're doing that in a measured
fashion. Testing it and piloting it in certain areas first, but I see that we've got a lot of levers we can continue to pull on
fuel consumption rate.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Following up that, if you do improve fuel economy do you have to in effect give some of
this back via reduced fuel surcharges.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: If you look at what we're going to do, Keith, we're going to invest in the economics and we
need to have a return on that in order to justify and pay for the investment that we're making in that. So, at this point in
time we're not looking at changing any of our fuel. Basically our fuel surcharge situation is designed to recover changes
in fuel cost and it will continue to be that way.

much lower?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, higher returns and higher interest rates are driving lower expected expense, are the
big drivers this year.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Right, but did you identify how much lower?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I did not.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Are you willing to?

Our final question is from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Hey. Good morning. I wonder could you provide some context as to what the
volume growth looked like for the UPDS and Streamline products in the fourth quarter and possibly provide some
perspective as to what that volume comprises the intermodal segment in 2013?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes, I don't think we historically break that out, but those are good vehicles for us to grow our
business. We have a great business development focus and both of those are and continue to grow nicely for our
business.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: And then maybe as we look into 2014, when you think about container growth of
your controlled fleet, can you provide a number for where we ended 2013 from a controlled container fleet perspective
and what the growth expectation for 2014 will be?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: You're talking about the size of your fleet?
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Yeah, the EMP and UMAX.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We historically have not discussed publicly the total size of our fleet. We do think that those
strategies of an owned fleet are the right strategies so we would be maintaining – you could assume we will be
maintaining or growing the size of our fleet.
