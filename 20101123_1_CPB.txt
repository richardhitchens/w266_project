Now I give you our President and CEO, Doug Conant.
Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, Happy Thanksgiving.
This morning we reported earnings per share of $0.82. This result was consistent with the estimate we gave on
November 10th when we adjusted our annual guidance. At our Analyst Day last summer and in our annual report we
gave a consumer view of our entire portfolio. We divided it into healthy beverages, baked snacks and simple meals. We
further divided simple meals into meal makers and meals.
Within that framework we delivered a strong performance in healthy beverages this quarter we also delivered solid
results at Pepperidge Farm, which comprises over half of our baked snacks business. In addition, sales of condensed
cooking soups, the largest component of meal makers, rose this quarter. Growth in these businesses supported a 1 point
quarterly gain in volume mix, an important improvement compared with minus 4 points in last year's first quarter.
With that as background, today I'll give you some perspective on the performance of our largest simple meals business,
U.S. Soup, then I'll focus on the softness in ready-to-serve soups and condensed eating soups since they are the primary
drivers behind the recent guidance change. I'll also highlight the actions we're taking to improve our soup performance
over the balance of the year.
As we discussed earlier in our earlier release, in the first quarter we improved our soup volume performance – to
improve our soup volume performance, we stepped up our promotional profile, launched an umbrella advertising
campaign and improved our in store merchandising. We saw pockets of strength, most notably our condensed cooking
soups and our Healthy Request soup varieties, both of which delivered sales and volume increases in the quarter.
However our promotions did not deliver the planned volume increases in our ready-to-serve soups or our condensed
eating soups.
The backdrop for the limited market response to our promotional activity in these two soup segments during the quarter
reflects the difficult consumer environment, which, as you know, is pressuring volumes of other industry players. It
also suggests extraordinary competitive activity within the category. This competitive activity affected both our
ready-to-serve soups and our condensed eating soups as competition very aggressively promoted ready-to-serve soups
in many cases at prices on parity with our condensed varieties.
As reported earlier we chose not to match some of this promotional activity. In my view, it simply was and is not in the
best long-term interests of the category. As we look forward to the balance of the year we expect the second quarter to
be extremely competitive, potentially comparable to the first quarter. While this will put pressure on our earnings again
next quarter, we'll maintain a strong promotional program to protect our leadership position with consumers and to
honor our customer commitments.
As we move into the second half of our fiscal year, in anticipation of commodity cost inflation and to improve
profitability, we expect to adjust our promotional programs to improve price realization and to begin rebalancing our

marketing mix towards advertising and brand building. In addition, we'll step up our investment in innovation to drive
category growth. We'll cover more on these fronts at CAGNY in February.
Now, to expand on our performance in the quarter and to review this year's profit delivery expectations, I'll turn you
over to Craig Owens.
B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Administrative Officer
Good morning. I'll take a few minutes to walk you through the first quarter results and segment highlights and then I'll
follow with some comments on our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance.
For the quarter, we reported net sales of $2.172 billion, down 1% versus the first quarter of 2010. Excluding the
favorable impact of currency translation, organic net sales decreased 2%, primarily due to lower sales in our U.S. Soup,
Sauces and Beverages segment where we significantly increased promotional spending.
EBIT of $444 million for the quarter was down 7% versus a year ago, primarily due to the increased promotional
spending partially offset by productivity improvements in excess of cost inflation and by favorable mix.
The quarter's EPS declined 6% to $0.82. For perspective, we were lapping a very strong quarter a year ago in which
adjusted EPS grew 14%. In the first quarter, we reported net sales declined including a decline of 3 points attributable
to the impact of increased promotional spending primarily in North America. This was partially offset by a 1 point
increase from volume mix and a 1 point increase from currency translation. Organic net sales decreased 2%.
Our gross margin on slide 10 declined 70 basis points to 41.2% in the current quarter from 41.9% in the first quarter of
2010. The change was primarily due to increased promotional spending partially offset by productivity gains in excess
of inflation and by favorable mix. Despite increased advertising and consumer promotion spending, marketing and
selling expenses decreased 2% to $277 million. The decline was primarily due to lower selling expenses as we have
reorganized our sales teams in the U.S. to improve effectiveness and efficiency. We also realized cost savings in
marketing overhead for the period.
Administrative expenses increased $7 million to 140 million. Three factors drove most of the change: a 40% increase in
U.S. pension expense, higher long-term incentive compensation cost, and currency.
We have focused on cost savings efforts in the areas of selling and general and administrative expense to mitigate the
impact of inflation in compensation and benefits and we're seeing positive results from these efforts.
EBIT declined 7% in the first quarter due to the impact of higher promotional spending on sales and gross margin. As
Doug discussed, while higher promotional spending across many of our businesses drove higher volumes, it did not
yield the planned volume lifts in our U.S. ready-to-serve and condensed eating soup businesses.
Net interest expense for the quarter increased 11% or $3 million driven by a higher mix of fixed rate debt in the
portfolio following the issuance last year of $400 million in long-term debt. Reflecting the higher interest expense, net
earnings declined 8% for the quarter.
Diluted shares outstanding were reduced by 2% in the quarter due to the favorable impact of our ongoing share
repurchase program. Our share repurchases moderated the impact of the change in net earnings, resulting in an earnings
per share decline of 6%.
Now I would like to comment on our segment results for the quarter. In the U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment,
sales declined 3% primary due to a 5% decrease in U.S. soup sales. The decrease in U.S. soup was attributable to lower
price realization driven by promotional depth and frequency. Our healthy beverages business continues to perform
extremely well. Both volume and sales increased by double digits. We posted gains in V8 vegetable juice, V8 Splash
juice drinks and in successful innovations, including our new V8 V-Fusion + Tea varieties.

The level of competitive activity in our sauce categories increased this quarter. Sales of Prego pasta sauces declined
slightly as higher promotional spending was partially offset by volume gains and sales of our Pace Mexican sauce
business declined. Operating earnings declined 11% to $295 million this quarter from 331 million a year ago. The
reduction was primarily due to the increased promotional spending partly offset by supply chain productivity gains in
excess of cost inflation.
U.S. soup sales for the quarter declined 5%, condensed soup sales declined 1%, ready-to-serve was down 13% and
broth sales fell 2%.
As we mentioned earlier, the two segments that comprise our simple meals portfolio are: meal makers, those products
which are used as ingredients in a meal; and meals, those products which are simply heated and consumed. Within
meal makers, we had strong performance in sales of condensed cooking varieties which rose 7% as the business
responded to our marketing efforts. While our broth sales were down slightly, we expect improved performance in this
business during the holiday season.
Our issue in meals has been in our eating soup varieties, both ready-to-serve and condensed. We increased our
promotional spending yet did not achieve the planned levels of volume gain. Our promotional spending in the
ready-to-serve segment and even steeper discounting by competition lowered sales in our condensed business as the
price gaps between ready-to-serve and condensed narrowed.
Looking ahead, we expect to spend competitively through the second quarter and then begin to shift our marketing mix
from trade promotions to more advertising and equity building activities for the second half. We anticipate that this
shift will improve our profitability in the back half, and help offset an anticipated increase in cost inflation.
On slide 16, there's a look at category performance in the United States during the latest 52 weeks based on IRI panel
data and Campbell internal estimates. Economic conditions remain very challenging making it more difficult for the
entire food industry to grow sales.
In the soup category specifically increased promotional spending by Campbell and by other branded players has not
succeeded in growing the overall category either for the quarter or for the year. The overall category declined 6.8% in
the past 52 weeks. Our sales declined 7.7%. Private label dollar sales also declined over the 52 week period.
Private label's market share in soup grew in the past 52 weeks, yet at only 12.5%, its share in soups significantly trails
its share in most other mature food categories. Campbell's dollar share in wet soup for the past 52 weeks was 62.4%.
The decline in our dollar share was driven by ready-to-serve soup and condensed eating soups. From a volume share
perspective, our increased promotional activity kept our market share steady this past year.
In Baking and Snacking, organic sales were comparable to a year ago. Volume sales in both Pepperidge Farm and
Arnott's were offset by increased promotional spending net of pricing. In Pepperidge Farm, volumes rose due to strong
growth in Goldfish snack crackers, gains in Baked Naturals and the successful expansion of the Deli Flats line.
Sales in our Arnott's business in Australia were comparable to a year ago as continued strong gains in Shapes and
Vita-Weat savory crackers were offset by declines chocolate and other sweet biscuit products.
Earnings for this segment were flat versus prior year. Currency gains and growth in Pepperidge Farm were offset by
lower earnings at Arnott's as we lapped double digit growth at Arnott's in the year ago period.
Organic sales in International Soup, Sauces and Beverages were comparable to a year ago. Gains in Europe driven by
Germany and gains in the Asia Pacific region driven by volume improvement in the Australia soup business and in
Japan were offset by sales reductions in Latin America. Operating earnings for the segment rose 16% reflecting strong
earnings growth in Europe.
Continued weakness in the foodservice sector led to organic sales and earnings declines of 5% and 12% respectively in
our North America Foodservice segment.

Moving now to cash flow and the balance sheet on slide 21, cash flow from operations was a use of $29 million
compared to a use of $36 million a year ago. The impact of lower pension contributions in the current year was offset
by higher working capital requirements and lower earnings. Capital expenditures of $27 million declined from 44
million a year ago.
In the first quarter we repurchased 4 million shares at a total cost of $156 million under our strategic share repurchase
program authorized in June, 2008 and under the company's ongoing practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset
those issued under incentive compensation plans. Net debt was $2.789 billion, a decrease of $40 million compared with
a year ago.
In our news release on November 10, we revised our 2011 guidance and we're confirming that guidance today. For the
year, and reflecting a 1 point favorable impact from currency translation, we expect growth in net sales of 1 to 3%,
adjusted earnings before interest and taxes comparable to the prior year and earnings per share growth of 2 to 4% from
the prior year adjusted base of $2.47.
As Doug mentioned, we'll continue to spend at competitive levels in the second quarter putting downward pressure on
our margins which will likely result in a quarterly earnings decline and first half result that will be directionally similar
to the first quarter. We expect earnings growth in the back half of the year as we improve price realization, achieve
further productivity gains from our supply chain maintain our good expense management and continue to realize the
earnings per share benefit of using our free cash flow to repurchase shares. Our full year guidance is based on our
assumption that achieving improved price realization will improve sales growth in the second half.
With that I'll turn it back to Jennifer for the question-and-answer session. Thank you.
Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations
Thanks Craig. At this time Mary we're going to conduct our Q&A session. I would like to request that our callers limit
themselves to a single question so that we may respond to more people who have questions in the queue. However we
would like you to stay on the line while we answer your question just in case clarifications are needed.

I'm sorry our first question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays Capital.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hello, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning. I guess you know, Doug when you arrived at Campbell's 10 years ago or so,
you took a fresh look at the business, fresh eyes and made some tough decisions rebased the earnings level to increase
your investments in R&D and marketing and a lot of those investments really did pay off and you saw much better
soup growth and a much better track record there in the years that followed. I'm curious, if you were to take a similar
look at the business today and it is a little harder, admittedly, but kind of with fresh eyes, almost as if you were again an
incoming CEO and I realize Denise will, of course, have her say on all of this in due course, but if you were an
incoming CEO, what would be the two or three key things you would point out today to the investment community,
you know, that might give us some perspective on it?

<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And you want that answer in 25 words or less,
Andrew? [Laughter].
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Well, maybe the one or two key things then?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No. Well, sure. The first thing I would observe is,
wow, what a great category. You know, and what a great leadership position we have. We're in nine out of 10
households in the United States in U.S. Soup. We have on average, anywhere from eight to ten cans in the pantry.
We're incredibly relevant to today's consumer. So we have a high penetration and we have a real presence in the fabric
of American families in the U.S. Soup business.
Our challenge, I think, is to deal with some new – some paradigm shifting going on where consumers are rethinking the
way they purchase their food and beverage products. And if I was to look at it I would say clearly the increased
promotional activity that was accelerated by some of the competitive – some of the competition just hasn't helped the
category.
My experience is, when we innovate, the category benefits and we win. When we innovated at – earlier in my tenure
with the first microwavable soups, Soup at Hand was the product of the year in the food industry and the category
grew. When we innovated with I.Q. Maximizer at shelf, the category grew. When we innovated in ready-to-serve soups
with a whole new fresh look at our Select Harvest franchise targeted at women, Select Harvest was the product of the
year in the food industry and the category grew.
I think our challenge is that we didn't have adequate innovation to attract consumers in a compelling way to the
category this year and price alone is just not enough.
The other thing I think we need to do is get back to a better balance wean our promotional spending and our brand
building activity. We're competing with a lot of simple meal alternatives. We have to have a meaningful presence there.
We're in the pantry. We have got to get out of the pantry and we have to increase usage. We're not going to do that
through price promotion that puts more in the pantry. We have got to pull it out. And so I think the focus on brand
building and relevant innovation are the two keys for the U.S. soup business.
That having been said, I feel great about the platforms we have built in our healthy beverage portfolio and our baked
snacks portfolio. As I shared in July, I think we – we arguably have the best performance in the world in baked snacks
over the last five years. And we have great innovation there. And we arguably have the best performance in healthy
beverages in the last five years, particularly in vegetable based beverages. We have great innovation there.
We have got to innovate and brand build in soup the way we have in the past and the way we have in the other
categories and that in 25 words or less is the challenge – or more.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: That's helpful. I appreciate the perspective. I guess maybe some had perhaps expected
hopefully that some of the restage on condensed this year and some other things you are doing would have been maybe
enough of a step up, although not where you ultimately wanted to get to, to have a bit of a better soup performance
coming into this year.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Interestingly, Andrew, you know, it is too early
to call on the condensed soup relaunch. We had terrific response on half of our portfolio in condensed cooking soups.
Where we got hurt was in condensed eating soups with aggressive price competition from other players, price
competition that I honestly believe is not sustainable and we just chose not to compete at that level. And we'll slog
through that over the next quarter or two.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks, I appreciate your thoughts.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations>: Mary, next question please.

Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations>: Hi Vincent. Glad we got you.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Sorry about the phone difficulties. My one question would be...
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You are going to blame the phone?
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Doug, you talked about eight to ten cans being in the pantry. If you look back over time, is
that eight to ten a consistent number that's been in there or is that number going up or down or is there risk that that
number is going to go from eight to ten, to six to eight, or four to six?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well it is roughly steady but I would say if I had
to, you know, our measurement in this area is not – it is hard to measure. Of but if I was to say anything, there's been a
tick up in this period over the last 12 months and so it's not an issue per se of people putting soup in the, our soup in the
pantry. Our challenge is getting it out of the pantry, which is why we chose not to be as competitive as we could have
been in our promotional spending. We believe in the long-term benefit of brand building and we're going to focus on
that as we go forward.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: And do you think there's any risk that the amount of spending that you need to put in place
in order to get the soup out of the cupboard is in excess of what you are modeling today.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We have got to rethink that given the
environment as it is challenge but I think there was some good work done by someone from your crowd that talked
about our share of spending and I think that's, we have got a commanding presence there. I think we can find our way
through that but we clearly have to have better balance between our trade spend and our consumer spend.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay, thanks very much, I'll pass it along.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations>: Next question please.

Our next question comes from Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations>: Hi Eric.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Hi, good morning everybody. Happy holidays, Thanksgiving.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Glad to know your phone is working.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Yep, at least that's working.
I guess the question – maybe a bit of a follow-up on Andrew's earlier point. In terms of the innovation success, I guess,
Dough, I agree with you that it is not necessarily always our focus, but you have been quite strong in biscuits and
beverages whereas the innovation in soup of late has lagged and hurt – obviously hurt the category. In fact it seems like
the category decline actually accelerated in the last quarter versus the trailing 52 week data that you gave before.
In any case, the question is, is it the nature of the categories in biscuits and beverages that it is more of an impulse
purchase and that's making the innovation there easier or more successful versus, you know, the soup which, you know,
is just, I guess inherently less impulse oriented or less convenient oriented and that that's the challenge?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, a couple of things, Eric. First of all, I think
the reason you see the deterioration in category performance is not necessarily due to innovation. It is simply due to
some very aggressive price promotion and sales deflation. I think on a volume basis it is holding up just fine, but

nonetheless, sales dollars are down. In terms of, I believe every category has its own rhythm. And we focused heavily
on renovation here within our U.S. soup portfolio this year. We were very focused on getting our product quality up,
our sodium levels down. As you know, we have front of pack labeling coming in the next few years and we wanted to
make sure that our portfolio was very prepared for front of pack labeling in a very positive way.
We have done that, but what it meant was we did a lot of renovation and not a lot of innovation and now other peers
have also talked about that. And there's a recognition in today's environment you need to create more excitement in
your category. We just didn't do that in soup this year. But I would go back to, we have done it in prior years and we
have done it in other categories.
So our challenge now is to rethink how we compete and take a fresh look, as Andrew talked about, given the reality
that the consumer is changing their shopping behavior and we have got to come up with creative solutions here because
some of the ways we have approached it in the past are not necessarily working as we would have expected.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: As a follow-up – thank you for that. But as a follow-up, do you see that as being as either kind
of an SG&A or capital expenditure as a pretty high cost? I mean, you know, when – again, to Andrew's point, when
you came in a decade or so ago, you know, the company had basically starved itself. And you know, literally you had
to upgrade the cooking, you know, methodology for condensed. And so are we talking about, be given the change in
the consumer a need to really, I don't know, aggressively rework the ingredients or the, how you cook it or you know –
I mean, I'm no expert, but just how should we think about that?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Eric, I personally believe we have got to
take a fresh look. So I don't want to close off any options, but that having been said, we have a very clear line of sight
to how we can improve the processing of our soup. We have talked about it before in terms of our...
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations>: Common soup platform.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: ...our common soup platform and we have a line
of sight to how we can – it may require some investment which we have not defined fully yet, but where we can deliver
soup at a higher quality and lower cost so we have a whole body of work going on there.
But in terms of innovation, we have the capacity and we have the funds necessary to step up our game in innovation in
soup. There's nothing we cannot manage corporately but we do have to rethink that and we have to keep an open mind.

Our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Good morning everyone.
<A>: Good morning Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Hi. I guess, sticking with the innovation theme here, I'm curious about the V8 soup platform. It
feels as though it went through its re-branding after Select Gold transitioned into V8 soup, but it's been left with
relatively few SKUs in there. I don't think much marketing has gone behind that brand. Maybe there's still the
limitations, you can't really put bits into it and there's not much garnish in there. Could you give us some idea about
whether there is, there are, you know, could there be major expansion plans in that area and if so, what holds you back?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, there's nothing really holding us back.
There is some technology where we can't get full pieces of vegetables and meat into the product given the constraints

of the technology and the FDA regulatory requirements. But basically, U.S. consumers like big chunks of meat and
vegetables in their soups which this technology doesn't lend itself to.
Now in France, Belgium and several other countries where we compete, the dominant form is that aseptic package that
we sell the V8 soups in. And in those countries that is the preferred way to eat soup. We're positioned now to bring that
technology to this country. And as we get further along with the evolution of the technology and can put bigger pieces
of garnish through it I think we're going to have an opportunity there. The important thing for us was to be the first
mover in this country, in this technology, in soup and to be in a position to advance it as soon as the technology
evolved far enough.
I think there's opportunity there. It won't change the fundamental trend in the category. But it is a good niche
opportunity. And over time, it could become bigger.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: I think
if you view it more broadly too we still feel there's some opportunity in premium soup. It may not be all in the aseptic
form but we think we have got some opportunities out there in our premium soup. We have got in our foodservice
business we're having success with volume growth at the premium end of the category and we think there may be some
other ideas out there around the premium end of the category that would go after that same consumer use occasion.

Our next question comes from David Palmer from UBS.
<Q - David Palmer>: Thanks. Question on Healthy Request and your mix of your soups. You say in the release the
Healthy Request varieties had a 9% sales gain across condensed and ready-to-serve. My question is, what is the mix of
Healthy Request of each of the categories ready-to-serve and condensed? How rapidly do you anticipate this mix
evolving?
And separately or, I guess, relatedly, do you believe the sodium concerns are becoming even more of an overarching
demand driver for soup lately or perhaps this is just a result of you converting your soups and the facings of your soups
to Healthy Request? Thanks.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure, David. I appreciate the question. I can't
break out for you Healthy Request by segment. What I can say is it's had a positive impact across all the segments.
And I think we have addressed the sodium issue in a very satisfactory way at this point for today and also for tomorrow
as we prepare for front of pack labeling. We're always going to have to be alert to dealing with that issue but by and
large, we think we have addressed it. I think the challenge for us now is to create some taste adventure and leverage
some of our other benefits as we continue to manage the sodium profile.
But we're not as concerned with it today as we were before we had a position in our portfolio to be in the right place
when we get to front of pack labeling, and we have done that. And so we have taken care of the long-term and now we
have got to focus on innovation in the near-term, which goes beyond just the elimination of negatives and starts to
celebrate the wonderful positives that we can do with soup.
So I think that's going to be our focus on innovation. On Healthy Request, by the way, is a good example. If we have a
clear and compelling platform that the consumer understands, they buy soup in a can and they buy it at a fast rate. Same
thing's true with our cooking soups. So we're not necessarily constrained by the can. If we have the right proposition,
we can grow that business and our challenge on our base business is to find that right proposition while we push off
into some new areas.

<Q - David Palmer>: I guess what I'm getting at on that whole thing if this is being done the right way in your mind,
as that mix increases, so might this stability and then ultimately the growth of the category, you know, however...?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Oh, absolutely. That will happen, and by the way
we sell it at a higher price with a better margin. And it is getting increasingly more important in our portfolio. So it tells
us we're on the right path. Not only that but we have actually lowered the sodium further on those Healthy Request
varieties and the consumer is, along with improved flavor technology, the consumer is buying the proposition.
So, in the fullness of time I think we're well-positioned there.

Our next question comes from Terry Bivens from JP Morgan.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi Terry.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Doug, let me come at it a slightly different way here. You guys have had some pretty good
innovation over the years but if you look at innovation like say microwavables, it seems in a weak economy to have
really kind of hurt you. I know in the take away there you and I have talked about it, hasn't been good. You have got,
General Mills they are pretty smart marketers, ditto Sam Reed's group. I guess my question, I hear this a lot from folks,
is the answer that we simply have to wait for the economy to turn? That soup is just innately going to struggle during a
downturn? That's my worry.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I – it is a well-founded worry, Terry. And
by the way, whoever else is on the phone, I would appreciate it if the next question could go to Craig Owens. But...
<Q - Terry Bivens>: We have got to keep you on the spot until you retire.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: [Laughter]. I'm sorry.
That is a concern, because we have a lot of pantry inventory. People are shopping the pantry. There's less incentive to
go out and buy more soup. We do have to navigate through that paradigm. There's no evidence that we can't navigate
through it other than we had a tough quarter where there was extraordinary price competition that we chose not to
match. So we are going to have to see how this plays out.
Terry, we can manage through this. We have been down this road, not quite the same way, before. When I started, our
soup business was, I want to say about $1.7 billion in sales and yeah, it's been tough, but up until – it is over – pushing
2.2 billion now. And we – and with good ROIC and good margins and we'll find our way through it. We do have to
step into the innovation, work the brand building. It is not easy. But if anybody can do it, we can do it.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. Thanks very much, Doug, I'll pass it along.

<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Chris Growe>: Doug, we're not going to let you off that easy.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: [Laughter].
<Q - Chris Growe>: I thought you should know, I'm wearing my parka, today. So we're hoping for some cold weather
too.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, soup also sells in Phoenix and Tampa.
<Q - Chris Growe>: I've heard that. My question for you is just in relation to trade promotion and maybe there's two
parts to it, maybe one. My point is you made some pretty clear comments you are looking for price realization now in
the second half of the year. Is that based on a change in your input cost outlook or simply just a change in the way you
want to attack the advertisings versus promotional balance?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, it is a little of both. But – and this is a
question Craig can weigh in on, but I'll start the answer.
Clearly, the promotional track is not helping the category and I guarantee you, it is not helping the other competitors. I
believe when you heard the TreeHouse earnings announcement, they were not too excited about soup margins either
and so I expect we're going to navigate through this thing and the category will pursue a more rational approach to
pricing and margin management. But I've got to tell you, if it doesn't, we're going to find the right balance but we'll
have to continue to compete because we're in this for the long-term. And so we're going to have to play this quarter by
quarter and manage it smartly. I expect it will be more rational in the second half than it's been in the first half. There
will be pressure on margins. We're expecting input costs to go up.
And I expect we're – everyone's going to have to find their way through this. Craig would you...?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Well
just to expand a little bit on the inflation piece of the question. We would expect input costs, commodity costs to be
somewhat higher in the second half. Not hugely so, and our overall inflation profile for the full year won't be a lot
different than it was in the quarter which was +3%. We'd expect it to be in 2 to 3% range on total cost of goods
inflation for the quarter but with a higher contribution from input costs in the second half and a somewhat stronger
enabler program and other cost savings in the second half.
We do however, recognize just as everybody sees, that the general trend in commodity cost is upward. And we think it
is important that we stay up with that and prepare ourselves for the second, for next year – not only the second half of
this year but for next year. That is part of what's driving our thinking around price realization.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We have worked hard to build, responsibly build
good quality margins here. Top quartile in the S&P food group and good return on invested capital. We're going to
work hard to maintain that. But we also have to compete and that's the balance we're going to work through over the
next three quarters.
<Q - Chris Growe>: I just want to make sure I was clear though. On this better balance between trade and advertising,
is that accomplished by reducing advertising in the second half of the year? I guess I already thought you were
balanced on those two items.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Well,
we were more balanced until the first quarter. And in the first quarter, our trade spending was up, as you can tell. And
although it didn't go up as much as some of the competition's trade spending went up. So, you know, I expect the trade
spending part of that will come back to us in the second half.

<Q - Diane Geissler>: Good morning.
<A>: Good morning Diane.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: I apologize in advance if you have already covered this, I may have missed it. Could you just
comment on, what were the volume trends in U.S. Soup versus take away?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: I don't
recall that we commented on the volume trends. They are better than the consumer takeaway numbers. I don't want to
get into precedent setting here, but they were better than the dollar takeaway.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay. Is that a concern for you, as you head into the second quarter and into the back half of the
year that maybe you have a little bit, you know, little bit of an inventory build?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Not particularly. I wish we had a problem with
inventory build. That means our sales would have been higher. Our volume was still down for the quarter in soup, I
believe I'm looking at – yeah. So our volume was still down but not – you know, modestly. So we came into the year
focusing on delivering better volume trends. And we did improve the trend line there.
But I – in my opinion, it is very manageable at this point.
<A - Anthony DiSilvestro>: In the quarter most of the sales decline, Doug mentioned U.S. soup sales down 5%, most
of that is driven by the increased promotional spending. And related to inventories we have not seen any material
change in retailer inventory level.

Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale from KeyBanc.
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on the soup performance
relative to simple meals. You have not talked about that too much. Can you just update on how you think you are doing
relative to simple meals, if you are losing share there? You talked about trying to improve velocity in terms of the
number of soups you are selling every year. But I'm trying to figure out whether that's a problem relative to simple
meals or it is just a problem within the category itself?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I don't have good data for simple meals
that's comparable to the data we're sharing with you. But overall, what I can say is last year at this, as we went into the
season we saw very aggressive pricing in other simple meals that we believe affected our volume performance.

We started to address that, and actually made great headway through August-September. What we see this year is, I
mean, since October, we see the other simple meal activity heating up on a price basis, as is indicated by all the food
companies' earnings announcements. And so we're – it is a dog fight again in terms of price competitiveness within the
category. I don't have data from other simple meals at this point to talk to you about the outlook for the season. We'll
have a better feeling for that as we go through the second quarter. But it's – there's no evidence that things have abated
there.
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: Okay. And just, the way I read the progression of things in soup. I wanted to know if I'm
reading it correctly. Last year, or a few months ago, you were talking about price as being the issue and bringing down
the price points within soup. That seems to have been done now. Now you are talking about, you know, holding back
on that a bit. What's going to be the next trigger? I mean, you also, today, talked a little bit about the possibility of
increasing the total dollars spent on marketing, including promotions. But you know, if this doesn't work, which is if
the industry, if the soup industry is not as rational in the back half as you expect it, maybe, what's the next thing that
you think will need to change here for things to get better.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we're always trying to find the right
balance between price and value addition. We call it total preferred value here, the sum of the benefits for the price
offered.
And every year it's a bit of a poker game. And what we learned in the first quarter is that price competition, per se, does
not necessarily help the category. I expect the category over time will become a little more rational and we'll see more
brand building and will see a moderated level of price competition.
I don't believe, we're not intending to suggest anywhere that total spending will go up in the second half. We expect our
trade promotion spending to come down and we expect to maintain a pretty good solid brand building profile. And we
expect to start to bring more innovation to the category.
We think that's a better model for the category. It meets consumer needs in a more complete way. But we have to see
how the game is played by other simple meals and by soup. What I can tell you is we will find our way through this.
We have before, and we will again.

range for the company. And fiscal '10 ended up at around 17.7. Do I have my numbers right, and do you think that that
ended up being the right level of margins for the company or do they need to go lower than that?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You have exactly the right numbers.
<Q - Rob Moskow>: Yes.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You did your homework, Rob. Very good. You
know, we have a new reality that will we're competing with today. You know, back when we talked about this, I don't
know, it could have been – several years ago. We had some competitors that were pushing 20 to 24 kind of EBIT
margin levels. In today's environment – and I thought 17 to 18 for a market leader, with our category, our portfolio, 17
to 18 felt about right.

We think that is about right. But we have to manage through it. Given today's new reality where the competitive fray is
intense. And as you see, all of our peer group is under margin pressure.
So we're going to have to feel our way through it. But you have the right margins. It is 17.7, and our goal is to be
between 17 and 18, top quartile in a sustainable way. We have climbed that hill and we're there now. And we're going

Our next question comes from Robert Dickerson from Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Robert Dickerson>: Yes. I just had a question around the balance sheet and cash flow. You know, obviously the
top line is a little bit weak, there's a lot of competition in the category sauce and soup. By the way, I feel like I've kind
of asked this question before, but you are still, you still have a pretty solid balance sheet. Your free cash flow yield is
still around 7%. I'm curious, you know at what point would you expect a little bit more activity in buying back shares
or allocating the free cash flow that you're generating to just try to spur growth? I'm not sure if you are trying to save it
to put it back into more CapEx or what. Excuse me. If you could just comment on that a little bit.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: You are
right. We do have a strong balance sheet. We have got terrific cash flow. We have always said the best investment in
our business is one we can put into organic growth. We have got, as Doug commented. We have got terrific margins.
We have got terrific return on invested capital. So anything that we can do to leverage core businesses and reinvest in
those businesses, some examples over the last couple of years would be investment in additional Goldfish capacity in
our Pepperidge Farm business, additional capacity in our Arnott's business in Australia. All of those kinds of
investments have terrific return on them.
As we move down from investment in core business, we have said that we would like to be and are more attentive to
opportunities around potential acquisitions of businesses that we think could be value accretive. It is not a very target
rich environment. You have not seen us act on one since the relatively small acquisition of Ecce Panis, but that would
still be a place that we would be looking.
We have had an active share repurchase program. As you know, probably most of you know we have been working
against a $1.2 billion program that the board approved in 2008 with a three-year timeframe around it. And we have a
continuing program of neutralizing compensation based equity issues.
And then the final thing we think about is around dividend. You saw us just announce a dividend increase coming out
of this last board meeting of 5%. So I think we're in agreement with you about the strength of the balance sheet, and
we, you know, we look at, and the strength of our cash flows and that's sort of the order of priority as we think about
where we have got opportunities and how best to deploy that cash.

they should have been or could have been but also that there was some feedback that as the leader in the category that
Campbell's needed to spend more in advertising and get more people, pull more people into the category.
So you came to this, came to the market with a plan where you have got umbrella advertising and you have got lower
price points and more competitive price points than you had the year before. And yet you know, we end up in this
situation where the decision was made to promote even more. So is there just a disconnect between the way you are
looking at the category versus the way retailers are looking at it?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: All I can say is we're aligned – we're lined up
with the retailers for a strong profile the next quarter or two. I think it is going to settle in in a more positive place. But
our brand building didn't start until September 7 and that's when the advertising started. And we're just getting warmed
up on the advertising front, we believe it's going to take time to establish that brand building profile with the umbrella
campaign and we're going to see it through.
The trade promotion in the first quarter was the Wildcard. We didn't get the lifts we would normally have expected.
And we have to go back to the drawing board on that. Part of the issue was that competitive activity was even more
intense and we have to sort through that as well.
I guess my point is, without talking about the, getting into the competitive details, we believe we can find our way
through. We have the margin structure. We have the capabilities to compete in the category. We're just going to have
feel our way through. We obviously have to lead the category to higher ground and we intend to do that over the next
three quarters. But we're going to have to feel our way through it.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: I don't
think there's any fundamental disconnect between us and the retailer. There's a lot made of the sort of the push and
shove between manufacturers and retailers. Right now, I think what you are seeing across the whole food industry is it
is a really difficult environment. You are seeing negative same-store sales out of most retailers. You're seeing down
spending across all categories in the grocery store, both dollars and units have been down over the last several periods.
I think we're all looking for ways to reinvigorate the consumer. And my feeling is, being a little distant from the direct
contact with the retailer, but we're all looking for ways to get the consumer moving again.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: I guess I just have the perception that you responded to some of the – Campbell's responded to
you know, some of the observations that were done in peer reviews or in category reviews. And what you have done is,
you know was basically undermined by the level of promotion that was allowed to occur in October. And I guess that's
the part I'm having trouble...
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think the challenges – well we have got to
play the hand we have. And we're going to continue the brand building which we know takes time. And the other
lesson learned, I would say is, that renovation was insufficient to drive short-term sales performance. We were making
changes, and we're evolving our U.S. condensed soup portfolio to be well-positioned when we get the front of pack
labeling in the next few years to get our health profile right. We have done all that. But it was – we had insufficient
innovation on top of that to get consumer interest. So we have got to step up the innovation while we continue to do all
this renovation work. And we'll do that. We'll profile more of that when we get to CAGNY.

some improvement the quarter after you course corrected, so to speak, after you had your weak quarter. You know, and
you have such an easy comp in the second quarter that, I'm trying to understand why the improvement might not come
a little bit sooner than you seem to be expecting?
And then as a quick follow-up to that, what gives you the confidence that you can get better price realization in the
back half of the year when you think about the current competitive environment?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Good
questions. Obviously, we're giving you, trying to give you a feel for our quarterly flow of business. But we don't give
quarterly guidance. And it could, we could do better in the second quarter. You know, these are unusual times as
reported by the entire peer group. And we're feeling our way through it. We have enough evidence to suggest that we
can do better on the price realization front in the back half. We know from today's environment what's working from a
trade promotion and what's not and that's changed a bit since even a year ago. I think we believe we can refine our trade
promotion plans in an intelligent way, deal with today's reality and be more effective and more efficient in the back
half.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think, too, Ed if you think about where the big
months are in the soup season, we have made customer commitments that run through the back end of the first quarter
and into the, you know, well into the second quarter which is sort of the heart of the increase in sales on a seasonal
basis. And so we have got pretty good visibility to where we'll be promotionally there. If you remember last year the
change in the formula a little bit came between, again, second quarter and third quarter, not between first and second.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations>: Thanks, Ed. Next question please.

Our next question comes from Eric Serotta from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Thanks for taking the question and happy holidays.
<A>: Thanks.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations>: Same to you, Eric.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Just looking at the, your comments in terms of the back half of the year, you know for the first
half of the year obviously you were promoting heavily and you planned to for the second quarter and weren't seeing the
lifts that you liked. What gives you, I guess, the confidence that in the second half as you pull back on some of that
promotional activity, tilt the portfolio more towards – or tilt the marking mix more towards advertising and actually
take promoted price points up that you are going to see a positive volume and sales improvement?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Well,
we have – Eric, I would just say we have some insights into what's working right now and what's not. And we see
pockets where we clearly overspent and didn't get the return. So there's, there are some low fruit opportunities.
We're also working with our retailers who are also looking to bring more profitability into the category. And, you
know, I just – it is informed judgment that we can, that we can do better but we have to wait and see.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the other point is, looking at the portfolio
beyond soup we're expecting improved top line performance in some of our other segments.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Yes.
That's a great point, because we do have very robust plans in baked snacks and healthy beverages. Also our meal maker
business with condensed cooking soups is doing very well and our Healthy Request soup is doing very well. So we're
dealing with a relatively small part of our earnings pool that is the issue for us. And clearly it is important, but we

believe we have enough buoyancy in the rest of the portfolio that we can navigate this.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay. Quick follow-up question on innovation. It came up several times, the importance of
innovation and your renovation not being enough this year. I'm wondering, is there something about the soup category
that you know, you feel you have kind of tapped out on the innovation potential? You had the big moves in sodium
reduction. I'm sure there's more of that to come but could you perhaps preview a bit for us what you are going to talk
about at CAGNY or give us some sort of a framework to think of the innovation that's coming in the soup category.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Well,
what I would share with you and we'll cover more of this at CAGNY is that we do have ideas in the pipe line that have
been well developed and we are preparing to move to market. Typically in food, there are five benefit areas: you have
taste, nutrition, convenience, variety and value. And we have really leaned in hard on nutrition and convenience as two
key foundational areas that needed to be attended to with the soup business over the last decade. And we have put
ourselves in a solid position there. Now we have to lean a little bit harder on the taste, variety and value dimensions and
we have ideas there. Those will be coming with us to CAGNY.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay, I'll pass it on. Thanks.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you, Eric.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations>: We'll take our final question.

Our final question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Doug, I know that the innovation and brand building obviously are important to grow the category.
But do you think perhaps maybe you are under-estimating the price issue in the category? What I mean by that is last
year you basically got hurt because you had a lot of competition from simple meals. This year you got hurt because the
competition really stepped up more aggressively. And granted it is only one month data but you look at Progresso's
performance in the last month, their volume was up 40% plus. I'm just wondering if as you look at the category and
take a fresher look at what you need to do, you know, brand building, innovation and everything else, you kind of also
have to look at the price points and address that part of the equation.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Absolutely. We're in a battle every day. We
compete for it. The 40% plus is a big number but, you know, the incremental cases competition shipped in October was
only 2% of our U.S. shipped volume for the first quarter.
You talk about big numbers on small bases with virtually no returns. We can manage our way through this, Judy.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Okay. Okay. Thanks.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President – Investor Relations>: Okay. And operator we'll conclude our call with that.
