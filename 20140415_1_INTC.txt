So with that let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich
Thanks Mark. 2014 is off to a solid start with our first quarter closing much as we expected. PC Client platform unit
volume was up year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Even as challenges remain in the consumer clients
segment, we saw continued improvements in enterprise clients driven by increasing form factor innovation and refresh.
Mobile unit volume was up year-over-year for the first time since Q2 2012 while the desktop units were flat
year-over-year with all-time record core volume and mix.
Our Data Center revenue grew 11% year-over-year and the enterprise segment was, again, in positive territory up 3%
over the last year while cloud, networking and storage were all up in excess of 20%.
The newly formed Internet of Things Group which includes our embedded business grew 32% year-over-year with
particularly strong demand in in-vehicle infotainment and retail while the Internet of Things Group's Atom volume
nearly doubled over Q1 of last year.
We had all-time record NAND revenue driven by the Data Center and particularly the cloud. And McAfee reported
record Q1 bookings along with an 8% year-to-year increase in consumer bookings. Perhaps more importantly, we made
progress against our most critical strategic objective and I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight that progress.
In PCCG where we're working to reinvent computing, new form factor innovations, longer battery life and OS of
choice, we saw 2-in1 volume increased more than 20% sequentially in a seasonally down quarter. We're now expecting
more than 70 2-in-1 designs for the back-to-school selling season and many will be offered at $699 or less. These
trends, in combination with renewed interest in Windows 8 with our customers are encouraging.
At the same time, we are ramping more than 130 Atom microarchitecture notebook and desktop designs with our Bay
Trail-M and -D platforms, significantly increasing our presence in the value segment. And we exit the quarter with
market segment share leadership on Chrome systems. And we saw a positive traction in small form factor and all-in-1
computing.
In DCG we launched our Ivy Bridge MP server CPU family known as Xeon E7. The new E7 line which features the
largest memory footprint in the industry saw particularly strong reception from enterprise as a result of its high speed,
real time data analytic capability. We also announced an important strategic alliance with an investment in Cloudera
which is designed to accelerate Hadoop innovation and penetration, particularly on IA.
We've broken out MCG results for the first time this quarter. In order to achieve long-term success in all of our market
segments from 2-in-1s all the way through to the Internet of Things we're making the investments necessary for
leadership and you can see these investments in the MCG's results.
For example, at Mobile World Congress in February, we announced multi-year multi-device agreements with Lenovo,
ASUS, Dell and Foxconn to expand the availability of Atom based smartphones and tablets. We set aggressive goal of
shipping 40 million tablet SoCs this year and I'm happy to say, we powered more than 90 designs on Android and
Windows and shipped 5 million units in the first quarter placing us squarely on track to that goal.
Our first LTE solution, the 7160 is now available in the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo and the ASUS Fonepad 7 in
addition to the previously announced Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.
Our CAT6 LTE solution, the 7260, with carrier aggregation is on track to ship this quarter and Samsung, ASUS,
Lenovo and Dell are all committed to the platform on a combination of phones and tablets, along with module vendors
like Huawei and Sierra Wireless.
We've demonstrated SoFIA, our first integrated apps processor in baseband after adding into the roadmap late last year.
We're on track to ship the 3G solution to OEMs in Q4 2014 with the LTE version following in the first half of 2015.

In the new devices and Internet of Things Group we're working to extend Intel technology into the fast growing world
of interconnected devices. We completed the acquisition of Basis. Basis provides access to new world-class technology
and a team of proven innovators. We also shipped our first Quark SoC for the Internet of Things and announced an
upgrade of Edison to the Silvermont Atom architecture. Edison is on track to ship this summer.
And in the Technology and Manufacturing Group whose work to advance Moore's Law is foundational to our
long-term success. We began production on our 14-nanometer process technology and remain on track to launch
Broadwell in the second half of the year. And our foundry team extended our collaboration with Altera for the
development of multi-die devices that take advantage of our world-class package and assembly capabilities and Altera's
leading-edge programmable logic.
Taken together, these milestones give me confidence that the pace inside our company and our progress with our
customers is accelerating. We've made a lot of changes, we have more work to do, but I'm confident that we will
continue to transform and realize our vision that if it computes, it does it best with Intel.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Brian. The first quarter came in consistent with expectations, demonstrating financial growth and a solid start
to the year. For the first quarter, revenue came in at $12.8 billion, up 1% from a year ago and in line with expectations.
PC Client Group revenue was down 1% from a year ago. We saw PC Client Group platform unit volumes grow 1%
year-over-year and inclusive of tablets, we saw high single-digit unit growth. PC platform average selling prices
declined 3% on a year-on-year basis. Our Data Center Group revenue grew 11% from a year ago with platform
volumes up 3% and platform average selling prices up 8% over the same period.
Some insights into the revenue results of our new segments. The Mobile and Communications Group is down 61%
from a year ago. The underlying dynamics are consistent with what we shared at the Investor Meeting last November.
We're seeing a decline in our feature phone and 2G/3G multi-comm business as we are in the midst of a transition to
integrated LTE solutions. In addition, the ramp in tablet volume is being offset by an increase in contra revenue dollars.
The Internet of Things Group is up 32% year-on-year. We continue to see robust growth across segments, with
particular strength in point-of-sale devices in retail and in automotive, in-vehicle infotainment systems.
Gross margin of 60% was down 2 points from the fourth quarter and 1 point above our guidance. Spending came in at
$4.9 billion, $100 million above our outlook, primarily driven by a current period charge relating to ongoing litigation.
Operating income for the first quarter was $2.5 billion, up 1% from a year ago. And earnings per share was $0.38,
down 5% from a year ago.
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2014, we're forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13 billion,
up 2% from the first quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the second quarter. We're
forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the second quarter to be 63%. The three-point increase from the
first quarter is primarily driven by lower factory startup costs as we ramp 14-nanometer. We are also forecasting higher
platform volume and lower platform write-offs as a qualification of our first 14-nanometer products. This was partially
offset by the increase in tablet volumes and their related contra revenue dollars.
Turning to full year 2014. We're still planning for revenues to be approximately flat to 2013. We expect PC Client
Group revenue to decline in the mid-single digits and the Data Center Group revenue to grow in the low double digits.
We're forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 61%, up one point from the outlook provided in January.
This increase is primarily driven by lower unit costs across both our PC and tablet products and lower non-production
manufacturing costs.
We're forecasting spending for the year at $18.9 billion. This $300 million increase over the prior outlook is driven by
increased R&D investments and litigation expenses. We still expect capital spending to be flat to 2013 with the

midpoint at $11 billion.
The first quarter was a solid start to 2014 reinforcing our view of the underlying market trends. The PC market has
stabilized and, on a year-on-year basis, we saw unit growth for the second quarter in a row. In the Data Center, we
continue to see robust growth rates in the cloud segment and the enterprise segment grew in the first quarter. These
trends led to Data Center growth of 11% year-on-year.
We are winning designs and ramping our tablet volume rapidly and we have design wins in LTE that will result in a
second half revenue ramp. Our Internet of Things business grew over 30% in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis
and we're driving significant innovation in this area as we invest to extend our architecture into the very low power
space and acquire IP and capabilities.
At IDF Beijing two weeks ago, we showcased the broad range of products we're bringing to the marketplace. These
products range from servers in the Data Center to innovative PC form factors like detachables and all-in-ones to tablets
to phones and to wearables. This is our strategy in action: if it computes, it does it best with Intel inside.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
All right. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. We're getting a little bit of feedback that some of you may be having a hard time
hearing us. So I'm trying a different mic here and we'll hope that that's better. Moving on to the Q&A. As is our normal
practice, we'd ask each participant to ask one question and a follow-up, if you have one.
Jamie, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Chris Danely from JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Hey. Thanks, guys. A question on gross margin. So it's going up nicely in Q2, but if you look
at the yearly guidance, it looks like it's dropping in the second half. Can you just talk about the reason that is
happening?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure, Chris. This is Stacy. I'd be happy to. Let me – I'll do the walk kind of from Q1 to Q2 and
then I'll give you a sense of what I see in terms of the pluses and minuses as we move into the back half of the year.
As we go into the second quarter, so we ended Q1 at 60%, we're forecasting Q2 at 63%. The big driver there is we get
about 2.5 points of good news associated with the fall off of 14-nanometer start-up costs. So it's pretty consistent with
what we've been talking about and what you've seen from us in the past. We'll get a little bit more good news
associated with Q2 being a bit up in terms of volumes, so that's about half a point. And then we get half a point in Q2
associated with lower platform write-offs as we qualify those first 14-nanometer products towards the end of the
quarter. And then there's a bit of an offset, as we ramp tablets and we start to see some of the associated contra revenue
dollars with tablets. We saw some of that in Q1, but we'll see a bit more in Q2 and so that's about a half a point offset.
So that gets us to 63% for Q2.
And then the math, if you triangulate a 61% for the year, I'd say that we have a gross margin in the back half of the year
that's in the low 60%s. I think the plus that we see going in is we expect seasonally stronger volume in the back half, so
that gives us a little bit of a plus. On the minus side, it's two things. One, the tablet volume is back end loaded for us.
Again, as you'd expect, it's primarily a consumer product. So we'll see, in the back half of the year, the ramp of tablets
and the associated contra revenue dollars, so that's a bit of an offset.

And then we'll also see costs coming down from Q1, Q2 to Q3 and then in Q4 we'll see a lot of volume coming out of
multiple factories on 14-nanometer and so you get a bit of a mix up in costs for those early wafers coming off of
14-nanometer and, again, that's a phenomenon you've seen from us in the past. We'd expect that to come down pretty
rapidly after that, but the first quarter tends to be pretty expensive.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Got it. Thanks. And for my follow up, maybe just give us your take on the PC space? Just talk
about how the market is doing now versus your expectations three months ago? And then any impact from the
expiration of Windows XP, either into your expectations for Q2 or with what happened in Q1?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. I can give you kind of an overall look at how we see the PC market. This is Brian. In
general, if you look at Q1 even as we head into Q2, it's playing out as we pretty much expected. We continue to see
strength in the enterprise and that's pretty much across the board everywhere. Consumer still remains a bit weak for us.
Emerging markets are starting to strengthen a little bit in the consumer, but the rest of the world is still showing some
weakness at the consumer level.
We think what's driving the kind of overall stabilization is a series of things that started to just play out in Q4 and we
see them playing out into Q1 and we think throughout this year. Some of it is – it's a mixture of things from – yes, there
is Windows XP, it is a part of this equation.
I don't think it's the driver. If you look at the form factors that we're bringing out, the price points that we've been able
to enter, you're seeing strong PCs down in the $200 range now, Haswell really coming to market as we enter into Q1
and into Q2. You saw the 130 Atom designs that we have out there, so it's a series of real vectors that are driving the
stabilization we believe.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Chris.
Operator
The next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Great, guys. Thanks so much. Just one point of clarification first. The segment, the
year-over-year segment numbers, is that apples-to-apples? Or does that include this year's reclassification, but it's
versus last year's old reclassification?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: No, no. It's apples-to-apples, Jim.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Apples-to-apples. Okay. Great.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Everything got restated.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Great. Terrific. Thank you. In terms of the contra revenue support going forward for the
tablets, can you talk about the pushes and pulls as we maybe go into 2015 or whatever period you want to talk about
going forward about what would cause you to continue to do that versus maybe cutting that off? That'll obviously be a
critical part of our model as we start to look forward into next year.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I'll be happy to, Jim. Yeah. Let me even back up and give you, again restate the strategy
of what we're doing here and Brian can come in over the top with some of the technology. But what we're doing is
we're taking Bay Trail, which is a product really designed for the PC market and we made a decision to take it broadly
across different segments of the tablet market this year. It brings along with it, at least over the course of the 2014, a
higher bill of materials. And that's independent from the SoC cost. It's the power management subsystem, it's the
motherboard that it goes on, it's the memory solution, those kinds of things.
And so we're providing some contra revenue to offset that bill of material delta over the course of 2014. Now as we
said, we're doing value engineering with our customers and our partners and so we're bringing down that bill of
material over the course of 2014 independent of any changes to our SoC. I'll pause here and actually let Brian if he

wants come in over the top of any the technology.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: I think Stacy has absolutely got it right. We have a series of improvements that have
already started to kick in in some cases around our power management systems, the number of layers in our
motherboards, the memory system integration. All of those things we've worked on and actually have started to see the
advantages already in our costs.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So I think, like dollars per unit, it comes down pretty dramatically over the course of 2014 and it
should be relatively small, if at all, as we get into 2015. And it's again the enablement we're doing around the bill of
materials and then we also have new products coming into the marketplace like SoFIA that's targeted at the low-end
and in 2015 you'll see Broxton, which is an SoC more for the mid-range to high-range of the market coming into our
product portfolio. So the combination of all that gives us a better cost structure with our own products and a better cost
structure overall with the bill of materials as we enter 2015 and then work through 2015.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Terrific. Thanks so much. Good luck.
Operator
The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Hi. Thank you. I had a question on the DCG, Stacy, just to make sure it's
apples-to-apples. The guidance that you've provided for this year as well as for the long-term CAGR, does that change
now that you have a comm infrastructure part also within that group?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, so interestingly what we're doing here, Ambrish, is we're actually now restating the
segment to match how we've been talking about the segment. If you go back to the investor meeting presentations over
the last couple of years, we've included the communications infrastructure piece of that because we do view it as part of
the server market. So you need to go back to Kirk's original presentation, I think it was two years ago, 2011 and you'll
see he's kind of clearly laid out in that long-term CAGR.
Brian and Renee have now organized the company more in line with that. So we have all of that under one group and
so we've redone our segments as a result. I'll also say, for Q1, just because I don't think you can see this anywhere else,
but the DCG year-on-year growth rate was 11% in the restated segment. If you took out the CID piece, so if we had not
made that change, it still would've been 10% plus. So it's worth about a point of growth in Q1. So I think, we're pleased
with the growth rate with and without, I guess is how I'd say it.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Okay. That's helpful because you're right at the last analyst day you did have that piece in
there when it was not part of DCG. My follow-up then is a quicker one. On the MCG side, are we looking at this
revenue run rate bottoming out here? Because now you're going into the back half, you also talked about CAT6
shipments. I think, Brian, you were at IDF or somewhere in Shanghai or in China. So is this the bottom for this segment
in the quarter? Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, I think you'll see two phenomenons as we move into the back half. So as we said, we're
seeing that on the comm side that transition from 2G to 3G, so we're seeing a troughing of that business and as we
move into the back half, we'll see the LTE, particularly the 7260 coming to market. So we'll start to see, I think, a nice
ramp in revenue on that segment. We'll have significant unit growth in tablets, but remember that contra revenue isn't
just a gross margin impact, it's actually a subtraction from revenue and so that'll kind of mute the revenue growth for
the segment because you have that negative as we get into the back half and ship more tablets. To the prior question, I
expect that to abate as we get into 2015, but you'll definitely see that in the back half of 2014.

<Q - Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I think a lot of us were
surprised to see Q1 notebook platforms up year-over-year as you guys alluded to. Why is third-party data off here,
perhaps even ODM data off so much? I imagine some of that's market share, but what might be the rest there?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You know, let me give you the wonky finance answer and then I'll turn it over to Brian to talk
about our notebook strategy and kind of how that's playing out across the products. But from a year-on-year
comparison, from our billing standpoint you have to remember that Q1 of 2013, there was a big contraction in the
worldwide supply chain in terms of inventory levels and I think impacted our billing. So we're, I think, getting the
advantage of a good year-on-year comparison point there. We still expect for the year that units are down in the low
single digits, and we'd would love to be wrong on that, but that's our view of the market. I think that's pretty aligned
with the third parties.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah, I would agree with that and that's not to say that inventories have grown. Actually,
inventories are in very good shape as we look across the entire supply chain, both within Intel and outside. So we think
inventories after that correction in the beginning of 2013 are actually normalized now where they'll probably stay. And
as Stacy have said and as we've said in the call, you're seeing us in all price points in this space, so you're seeing Bay
Trail and even more products down at lower price points. You'll also see us gaining market share in Chrome over this
time period, so we're in a significant percentage of the Chrome systems out there. So there's a variety of things that are
allowing us to get some upswing of that in the mobile market as well.
<Q - Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland>: Great. Thank you. As a follow up, so at one point there was Bay Trail-T,
M, and D for tablet, mobile and desktop. Is the M and D still accounted for in PC and T in tablet? And with that 8%
ASP decline that you guys had in mobile, was that natural? Or is that a mix in of Bay Trail-M? Thanks.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So – yeah, great question. So the first answer is, yes. The M and D would be included in
PCCG's results. The T is included in MCG's results and would be in the tablet volume that we're talking about. And
yes, the notebook ASP that you saw was exactly consistent with our strategy. We're bringing Bay Trail in there, it's got
right cost structure, actually the volume was a little ahead of what we thought in Q1. It's enabling us to grow units a bit
and maintain and grow profitability and the overall company's gross margin look pretty good too.
Operator
The next question comes from Doug Freedman from RBC.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Thanks for taking my question, guys. And a few of the things that you've guided to we've
really never seen in the history of Intel and that being OpEx dropping rather materially in the back half of the year. Can
you give us a little bit of color on what you're doing to make that happen?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I mean, we're, as we said a quarter ago, we're bringing employment down over the course
of the year. In particular, we're driving for some efficiencies in the engineering organization. They're happening a little
later than we thought, but we're – what Brian and Renee are driving for is to get more output and more products and
more derivatives to the engineering teams and that'll result in some efficiency as we get into the back half.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: And I guess, for my follow up also another sort of spending question that being on the CapEx.
I believe there was a change to the longer-term roadmap on your move to get to 450 millimeter and yet we're not seeing
really any change on your CapEx spending. Is there a change that we should be thinking is possible in the future? How
would you talk about your CapEx? In the past you talked about maintenance and then the other, if you could give us an
update on that?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: The 450 millimeter, let's start with that essentially. We haven't changed, we've said that
actually our 450 millimeter is somewhere in the latter half of this decade, right? So we're still saying that. You're going
to see gives and takes on 450 millimeter spending. These are long drawn out programs over multiple years and so I
think you don't grade the whole program by one shift in when we buy a tool or when we move out some spending in
some cases. And don't forget anytime we do that you typically have just more 300 millimeter that you're going to spend

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations. Stacy, question on gross margins, has the
full-year expected impact for tablets changed at all? And if memory serves me correct that was 150 basis points. And if
I do the math right, would that alone account for about 2.5 percentage points of decline in Q3, Q4? Am I doing that
correctly?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So the answer to your first question is that our expectations haven't changed. I mean, there may
be, the second decimal may have changed, but directionally it's the same. And as Brian said in his prepared remarks,
we're actually feeling pretty good about the line of sight we have across the customers, the kind of longer-term
agreements we have in place and design wins that we know are coming to market as well as the Q1 volume.
In terms of the impact in the second half, now, I haven't done the math that way, but just to manage your math as you're
probably not too far off because it's 150 basis points more or less for the year and it's back-end loaded. So it's going to
be in that kind of a range. I did do the math for the back half saying that is kind of the, that as well as the Q4 cost of
14-nanometer out of multiple factories is the thing that kind of keeps us in the low 60%s as opposed to higher. So I
think your math probably is pretty close.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Thanks, guys. And as I follow on, Brian, can you talk a little bit about the expectations around
the Grantley product launch? Nehalem, clearly, drove good growth in DCG. Romley was a little bit more mixed.
What's the expectation for Grantley? And is there a there a concern of a pause of buying in DCG ahead of the launch?
And how do you manage that?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: We look at the Grantley as a great product. I don't think there will be a pause. We've
factored that in to all of our forecasts, the launch dates. Those haven't moved. I don't see it as being a shift. Customers
typically line up their products around our product launches and they have several months to work around those and
forecast theirs as well. So I don't see a stall in our business based on what we see with the forecast right now.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, John.

The next question comes from C.J. Muse from ISI Group.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Yeah, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, since you announced
a vision for being a larger foundry at your Analyst Day, I'm curious what you've learned in your discussion with
potential clients in terms of what may be bigger opportunities than what you initially thought and perhaps what could
be bigger challenges? And I guess, as part of that, as you think about offering those foundry services to potential
customers, how do you think about maybe some of the changes you need to do in terms of toolsets with Fab 42?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So let's answer the first part first. I'd say the interest since we opened up the foundry has
been high. These interactions, just getting people comfortable with what the technology is, take several months.
Typically, there's deep interaction between the technical teams on both sides really understanding what the process the

silicon technology incorporates, what the design tools are, what IP we have to offer, where they can go get third-party
IP, all of those kinds of interactions. Those have been ongoing with many customers. And then you start the business
discussions around pricing and availability and all of that. So I'd tell you that the uptake has been strong. We've been in
many, many interactions. As far as what does it tell us about what needs to change in Intel? I think, we still have a lot to
learn about how to be a good foundry.
Altera, who is really kind of our lead premier customer, I'd say, a big customer, has really been helpful. They've helped
us see where we're strong and where we're not and what it takes to become strong in those areas. They're making good
progress on their products. I don't think there's a lot of change from a technology standpoint that outside the changes
we're going to make, say, at 10-nanometers for our own products. We're driving the lower power, more mobility, able
to integrate better, all of those things into our own products, integration of memory capabilities. That's driven by our
own need to move into those mobile spaces and that's helping us with the same roadmaps that are being required by the
foundry partners.
Fab 42 is purely a capacity driven based on demand. We'll trigger that as we trigger demand both ether internally or
from the foundry. Remember though the foundry partners signed up today is probably 2 years – 18 months to 24
months before first silicon and probably 30 months to 36 months before they really have ramped to any volume. And
Fab 42 is probably 12 months to 18 months from when you'd be able to bring it into capacity, so the two have much –
great deal of overlap.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And I would just add just reading into your question, maybe I'm reading too much, C.J., if
you're viewing the foundry business as we'd have a specific foundry factory that's probably not the case. These will be
run side-by-side with our own products and taking advantage of the same technology, technology features that we need
for our product line.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: That's correct.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Yeah. That's very helpful. If I could sneak in a second one here. In terms of integrated LTE, you've
talked about when you'll first see that, but curious when do you expect to bring that in-house at Intel?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: We'll bring that it on our 14-nanometer process either late 2015 or early 2016. We're still
battling back and forth on how fast we can bring it in and what impacts that has.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Very helpful.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: The 14-nanometer is a new technology there.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Great. Thank you.

The next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe it actually kind of follows up
on C.J.'s prior question. The MCG business that you're now breaking out, it's pretty clear it's losing $3 billion, $3.5
billion. How do you think about this business? Obviously, you're trying to ramp the product set. You're a bit behind.
You're entering from the low-end and that pricing seems quite tough. You're facing some subsidies that you have to do
on the tablet side. Are there some milestones that you look at to get this business back profitable? Or maybe would you
consider this strategic enough that you'd consider continuing to run this as a loss?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So you asked several questions in there, so let me start to kind of parse it apart. Absolutely,
this is a strategic business, so let's just start with that. We think this is critical and we've said this in our prepared
statements. It's critical from 2-in-1 devices down to the Internet of Things. When you look across the connectivity
requirements there, more and more the devices are requiring integrated connectivity whether it be LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, all of these conductivities are becoming more and more required.

We don't go into these businesses thinking that we're going to lose money. We believe we have a roadmap to get to
profitability in that business. The milestones that I look at and so I'll give you those for yourselves to look at, we have
the 7160, the current LTE version out there, we're the second in LTE. We have the 7260 launch this quarter, I think
that's a critical there, again, we're closing the gap with our competition. We're bringing out leading edge CAT6
capability with carrier aggregation. That's a critical milestone. That closes the gap and puts us firmly in the LTE
capability.
The next one is SoFIA. You'll look at the SoFIAs at the end of this year with 3G integration and then a big first half of
next year with LTE integration. Remember, those products weren't even on our road map six months or seven months
ago. So that shows that we are acting quickly, integrating and bringing those products to production. Then after that, as
Stacy said earlier, Broxton, which is our internal 14-nanometer product that's targeted towards the mid to high level.
And as we bring that into the second half of 2015 and into 2016, there'll be various levels of integration on that.
So when I look across this, those are the milestones I look at because those are what drives that along with the just
basic cost reduction capabilities we talked about for this year as we get out of this contra revenue into 2015. Those
products then place us firmly in leadership capability from the low end to high end with integration. And those are the
milestones to me that will lead to profitability, long-term.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And I'll just add to that. I think you left it off because it was so obvious. But the 40 million
tablets is one of the things I see, Brian, just laser focused on. And as we've talked about it before, it gets us into that
kind of 15% to 20% range of the total tablet market. It gives us a big enough footprint that we start to see people
developing on our architecture, so it becomes a self-sustaining kind of ecosystem as we're bringing these other products
to the marketplace. So don't lose sight of that one, Blayne.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Thanks. And then just as a second question, in terms of Broadwell timing, you had the one
quarter slip. It seems like no change so far. Are there any more hurdles in terms of yields or anything before this
product is ready to ship in the back half?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Well, as we said, we qualified for start-up production this month. We'll qualify for
shipment to customers towards the end of this quarter. Those are the first two milestones and we've passed one of them.
Then you'll start to see our customers bring products to market as we progress into the second half of this year. These
things are hard. There are always yield improvement efforts that we have and cost reductions that we're going through.
But I think we're past the first of the two big milestones by turning on the production internal and we have the next big
one at the end of this quarter with certifying to ship to customers. We don't see any roadblocks. We don't see any
issues, but that's still out there at the end of this quarter.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Great. Thanks.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, I wanted to dig a little bit into
the mobile and wireless group. So you've talked a bit about having – I guess, developing leadership position in order to
drive product profitability. But looking at this right now though, so we had the business fall more than 50%
sequentially. You have your 7160, which is shipping, but apparently it's not really driving much volume. We have the
7260, which is forthcoming, but we really haven't heard much about design wins and you launched at Mobile World
Congress without really seeing very much there. We have SoFIA coming, which absolutely is integrated, but it's being
made at TSMC for the next few years which means you lose any potential benefits from your own process technology
and you would seem to be well behind what the market leaders are shipping in terms of 4G.

Just what should we be looking for and over what timeframe should we be looking for, for the ramp? I guess, what I'm
asking is, how can we get confidence that we are going to actually see the revenue ramp that I guess is built into the
short-term expectations for this year and then going forward to make sure that you can actually get a profitable business
which, obviously, would be driving quite a bit of upside to where the models are today?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure, Stacy. I'll start and then Stacy can jump in. Remember the 7160, we gave you a series
of products that it's shipping in and on the 7260, which will qualify this quarter, we gave you a list of OEM partners
that have committed to that platform. So we're fairly confident that the ramp in the second half of this year will
continue on that product and it is a leadership product. SoFIA, you're right, is built at TSMC. We went for speed and
integration and it was simply quicker to get to market with a competitive product from both a price and performance.
We actually believe that the IA Core will give us better performance than the competition. And the competition is at
that same node at TSMC. And it's 3G at the end of this year and LTE in the first half of next year.
We then told you that in the second half of next year and, again, we're debating whether it's the second half or the first
quarter of 2016, but we'll move all of that internal onto 14-nanometers. And it's really based on other products that we
have moving in at that time and just overall resources, right? We have a lot going on: the ramp of Broadwell, the ramp
of Skylake in the second half of next year, plus bringing these products inside.
But I'm very confident that when you do that plus you add in Broxton which is targeted towards the mid-to-high range
and, again, it's is integrated with leading-edge LTE and don't forget, we have a roadmap of LTE products beyond the
7260 that continue the level of carrier aggregation and product leadership. We're fairly confident that we can continue
to grow this business and turn it profitable over that time.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And let me just comment on the question about the long-term profitability. It sounds basically
that it really stems from our manufacturing leadership. If we're two years ahead of the rest of the industry and
extending, it gives us the ability to as we target our products into the right space from a power standpoint, we'll have a
power advantage, a performance advantage and a cost advantage, that really is our strategy playing out.
You're seeing the first products hitting that theme over the course of this year and into early next year. Bay Trail is a
really good product for the high end of the market; you'll see products coming into the market that are more targeted at
the mid-range and lower end of the market next year. But that's how the strategy plays out. I would say for 2015, I
would expect to see a reduction in the loss, not profitability, but a reduction in the loss, we'll feel pretty good when we
get there and then we'll keep driving towards the long-term profitability goal.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Did you have one follow-up, Stacy?
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: I did. I did. I'd like to drill in a bit more actually into the tablet efforts now. So we're
obviously subsidizing and I get the idea of reducing BOM cost in order to make up for the deficiencies with the idea
being that you can drive improved products down the road. But at the same time, if you look at the tablet market where
it is today, you're obviously not going to be going after Apple anytime soon. Maybe there's a little bit of volume at
Samsung, but I mean, if you take those guys out, 75% of what's left is systems that are $250 and below where your
competitors are shipping quad-core chips for much less than $10.
I'm curious to know like what kind of economics and pricing you see from that market long-term? And are the, I guess,
the total revenue pool and profit pool that's available, even if you were to succeed at your goals, why does that make it
a worthwhile effort to actually go after? Or is this simply, as you said, strategic, is this an attempt to limit further
penetration of tablets into the core market?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So I'll start and Stacy is welcome to jump in. You've asked a question that has kind of
multiple questions built into it. But let's start with, what we told you was we've got multiple OEM partners building
tablets and phones on our products and we gave you ASUS and Dell and Lenovo and Samsung on those products. If
you look at the tablet business overall, it's broken up into a series of segments. And you're right, there is a large
percentage of them that are $250 and below. Products like SoFIA are specifically designed for that segment and our

dual-core SoFIA already performs quite well against quad-core systems. As we move into next year, we'll bring
quad-core SoFIA based products out as well. And so we believe that we can stay very cost competitive and have a
performance leadership.
Remember, Intel has two assets. We have our silicon technology, but we also have our architecture. And one of the
things an OEM gets when they build with Intel technology is that they can go into any OS and they could build a single
platform and move that onto Chrome, onto Android, onto Windows. And that's a very unique capability that we provide
to OEMs for flexibility.
So we believe with a product like SoFIA, as we bring that into the market next year, we can absolutely compete in
those spaces and make money. You're probably not going to make as much revenue dollars and as much margin dollars
as the PC business, but we think this is still critical, and it's critical for a variety of reasons. Part of it is simply the scale.
You want to have those units, you want to have a presence in all areas of computing. And the second one is that
developer attention. You want developers creating new products, doing innovation on your architecture and this is a
space that's got innovation. We are going to bring some of that innovation to this market.
You're going to see some tablets as you go into the end of this year. We've shown them at CES, some of the highlights,
where you have 3D cameras, you have perceptual computing capabilities for gaming. All of those kinds of things can
change the tablet market along with the PC market. So we believe that we can bring a lot of the innovation that we do
in the PC down into the tablet space. And, again, that keeps the developers developing and interested in our platform. I
think for all of those reasons, we want to be in this space and we will be in this space from now on.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. I would just add one thing as that was very complete, but we don't fear the low-end of the
market. You look at how we played out in PCs. You can drive a lot of unit growth by participating in PCs now that are
$199 to $250. We can have the cost structure because of our manufacturing leads that participate nicely there. And you
see that as markets mature, they also segment and so we have – if you look at our PC business, we have great demand
and profitability of Core i7s and that stands down to Bay Trail at the Atom segment of the market. So it's a
misconception to think that we only want to play at the high-end. Our manufacturing leadership can give us the cost
structure to play profitability at the low end as well.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: All right. Thank you, guys.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Stacy. And, operator, we'll go ahead and take two more questions.
Operator
The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Back on to the PC Client Group for a second
and on to the ASP side of the equation, between the desktop and the notebook, obviously there's very different
dynamics. Do you see a point in which the notebook side starts flattening out and starts to act like the desktop side
where ASPs have been up strongly both last year and year-over-year in the first quarter? Or is that pressure to the
low-end going to persist and so we shouldn't think of a flattening out anytime soon?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: No. I actually think more about the two markets together. I think you have this range of devices
that are computers and they range from high-end all-in-one down to $199 very low cost notebook computer that's being
sold. And I think, what we're seeing is kind of strength at both ends of the market. And if you look at our pricing over
the last three years, it's been pretty dead flat on average across the PC market. You can see from my gross margin
forecast for 2014, I'm not expecting ASP to be one of the big drivers. So you can take from that that we continue to see
a pretty benign pricing environment. So that's how I think about it. I don't know, Brian, if you...
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: No, I would agree. I don't see it behaving any differently moving forward.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: And I guess for my follow up switching over to the OpEx side, it's good to see the head count
coming down in the second half down versus the first half. But you're still significantly elevated versus your target

model. I know you're not going to guide for 2015 with any specifics whatsoever, but can you remind us if you do end
this year with lower head count than you ended the prior-year, so you're going into the year down year-over-year, is the
tick-tock of process engineering moving from R&D and the COGS a headwind or a tailwind in 2015? And are there
any big moving parts that we can think about for that year's OpEx versus this year's?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, it's the reciprocal to what happens to gross margin. So in a year like this year where you
see start-up cost coming down, that means that the engineers that were working on 14-nanometer that were being
classified as cost of sales now move to 10-nanometer and they're being classified as R&D. So next year you should see
gross margin, some headwind in terms of gross margin and some tailwind in terms of the R&D spending.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Thank you.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Ross. And, operator, can you go ahead and introduce our last question?
Operator
The final question comes from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Thanks for taking my question. First one, Brian, when you talk about the 40 million unit
bogey on tablets this year, could you go through the taxonomy of that a little bit? To what extent do think this is
Windows versus Android? And what's the class of product do you think will represent the mode or the mean? Like
where do you think your sweet spot is going to be this year on tablets?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So our mix of the OS' reflects pretty much what you see in the marketplace. So I
think, depending on how you look at it, it's probably something on the order of 90% Android, 80% Android, 10% to
20% Windows. Our percentages look very much like the marketplace. So if Windows continues to grow and gain
traction, I think our percentage would just align directly to that. So you can – don't separate what we ship from what's
basically the marketplace. We are leadership capability on all of the OS' now.
As far as what is the price point, again, it reflects fairly close to what the marketplace is. You see us in systems below
$100 now. The majority of the systems are, say, $125 to $250, somewhere in there and then you see us in some of the
upper-end systems, $250 to $400. But the majority is in that, I would call it, $125 to probably to under $250 range.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Thank you. And then as a follow-up, did you discuss like, do you expect to have Android
tablets ramping in volume this quarter? Should we expect to see the Bay Trail Android products at Computex this year?
When do we really see the material ramp in the Android products? Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. Absolutely. You can go out to the store today and buy an Android. In fact, I'd love
you to go buy one of the 40 million we'll sell but, yes, you can buy Android. It continues to ramp through this quarter.
At Computex, we'll show a series of Android and Windows based tablets. And they just continue to ramp through this
year, but they're on shelves today. I saw them in the store this weekend.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: The majority of the five million units, for example, are Android. Just as Brian said, it more or
less follows the distribution between Windows and Android.
