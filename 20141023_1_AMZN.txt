on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations
of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will
be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing twelve month operating cash flow
increased 15% to $5.71 billion. Trailing twelve month free cash flow increased to $1.08 billion. Trailing twelve month
capital expenditures were $4.63 billion.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to
investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our
fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 3%. ROIC is trailing twelve month free cash flow divided by average total
assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The
combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 481 million shares compared with 475 million
shares one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $20.58 billion or 20% excluding the $13 million favorable
impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Media revenue increased to $5.24 billion, up 4% or 4% excluding exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.95 billion,
up 26% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 68% of worldwide sales, up from 65%.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 21%, active customer accounts was approximately 260 million, worldwide active
seller accounts were more than 2 million, seller units represented 42% of paid units.
Now I'll we'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.63 billion, or
71.1% of revenue compared with 72.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content, and G&A combined was $6.09
billion or 29.6% of sales, up approximately 350 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.55 billion or 12.4% of
revenue compared with 11.5%.
Tech and content was $2.22 billion or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $961 million or 4.7% of
revenue compared with 3.9%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our
stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 25% to
$12.87 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.73 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $8.79 billion, representing 68% of
North America revenues up from 65%. Other revenue grew 40% to $1.34 billion.
North America segment operating income decreased 70% to $88 million, a 0.7% operating margin. In the International
segment, revenue grew 14% to $7.71 billion, excluding the $21 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange
impact, revenue growth was 13%. Media revenue grew 4% to $2.51 billion or 3% excluding foreign exchange and
EGM revenue grew 20% to $5.16 billion, or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of
international revenues up from 64%.
International segment operating loss was $224 million compared to International segment operating loss of $28 million
in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss was $136 million compared to consolidated segment operating
income of $267 million in the prior period.
Consolidated segment operating loss includes charges of approximately $170 million primarily related to the Fire
phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs.
Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating
expense. GAAP operating loss was $544 million compared to operating loss of $25 million in the prior period.

Our income tax benefit was $205 million. GAAP net loss was $437 million or $0.95 per diluted share compared with a
net loss of $41 million and $0.09 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $806 million year-over-year to $6.88 billion.
Inventory increased 21% to $7.32 billion and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.2 turns a year ago, as we expanded
selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $11.81
billion and accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 75 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've
seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently
unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding
exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict
demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign
currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can
all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings
or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange
rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4 2014, we expect net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion or growth between 7% and 18%. This
guidance anticipates approximately 250 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP
operating income or loss to be between $570 million loss and $430 million income compared to $510 million of
income in the fourth quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $470 million for stock-based compensation and
amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating or income or loss which excludes
stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense to be between $100 million loss and $900 million in
income, compared to $876 million in income in the fourth quarter of 2013.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We
believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareowners.
Thank. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.
Phil Hardin
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how
to initiate a question.
Q&A
Operator
At this time, we'll now open the call for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one
question. [Operator Instructions] Please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from
analyst Brian Pitts with Jefferies and Company.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great. Thanks. Two quick questions. Can you provide any color on the consumer over this year's
back-to-school season? And how do you view the outlook for the consumer as we head into the holidays? And then
separately, you recently closed the acquisition of Twitch last month. Can you help us understand where does Twitch fit
into your overall digital content strategy? Thanks.

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of back-to-school certainly the results are reflected in the Q3 results that you
see today. There's a number of different impacts back-to-school has. One thing I would like to call out, as you look at
our North American media growth rates, one thing that we are seeing is certainly a shift from a textbook standpoint
from purchase to rental. And so we see a lot more customers renting, so see that impacting the growth rate of the North
America media.
But in terms of Q4, as in any Q4, when we look at it, there's a wide range of outcomes, we're giving a wide range of
guidance. What we feel good about is we have a team that's been improving customer experience over the past 12
months. We're very excited to serve customers. We've got a lot of unique selection. We've got inventory closer to
customers. Many, many different things that we're doing on behalf of customers. So we're very excited about the
holiday season and look forward to serving customers.
In terms of Twitch, we're very excited to have Twitch as part of our overall team. We've been in video games for quite
some time. And we think that it's a very creative team, they're doing some very innovative things on behalf of their
customers and our customers, and so we're excited to have them be part of Amazon and look forward to working
together with that team.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Carlos Kirjner, analyst with Bernstein.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Thank you for taking my question. Two if I may. International CSOI margins this quarter
were the lowest they have been in years, maybe ever, I don't know. We know you have been investing internationally
but has something changed fundamentally, and if yes, what?
Secondly, I wanted to ask you about a vast difference if revenue growth rate between your International and Domestic
business. What is the fundamentally different between the U.S. and your main international markets, and is this
difference fundamental or temporary? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Thank you. Thanks for the question. In terms of the consolidated segment or the segment
operating income, excuse me, for international, certainly versus what you have seen last quarter there are some notable
changes. One is we're certainly getting ready for the holiday season. So, let's get ready for the holiday season. We are
expanding from a capacity standpoint. We do see, we've got great penetration fulfilled by Amazon customers, so you'll
see that actually our growth rate – unit growth rate is actually higher than our revenue growth rate. And so that's what
we've been experiencing. So we're certainly adding capacity from a fulfillment perspective, adding capacity from a
infrastructure standpoint. If you look at our overall operating expenses, we're certainly investing and with the slower
growth rate you're not seeing as – certainly not seeing as much as leverage. We understand that we do have to get
leverage over time, but we are investing right now. We're also investing in newer, emerging geographies, including
India, and Italy, and Spain, and continue to invest in China. And then one other call-out, we had mentioned in my
opening remarks there was approximately $170 million impact related to inventory evaluations and supplier
commitment costs. The vast majority of that was in North America but there was about $25 million in international just
to let you know that's there.
In terms of the growth rates it has been softer across a number of geographies, if you look back over the past really four
quarters. We've seen a little bit of volatility between the quarters, but it's been softer. We continue to focus on the
inputs and we still think international is a very big opportunity for us in terms of growth.
More recently, if you look at the growth rate for Q3 and you see the 13%, excluding foreign exchange, you may
remember on the last call about 90 days ago I talked about Q2. What had happened was we had seen – in late Q1 we
had seen a ramp-up in Japan before the consumption tax increase happened on April 1. We saw a pretty sizable
drop-off in Japan growth rates from Q1 to Q2 which brought that down. The only update – again there's number of
different puts and takes about geographies, but the only other comment I would say is that we really haven't seen Japan

growth rates improving since Q2.
So that's something that's there. But in terms of the fundamentals long-term, we're very excited about international as
well as North America. We think it's a big opportunity. We continue to focus on the inputs. Some of those inputs are
certainly on the media side, working on the conversion from physical media to digital media. We continue to work on
that in a number of different ways. We continue to add new selection in those geographies and work on the retail
basics. And so, again, we're very excited about the opportunity.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next call will come from analyst Scott Devitt with Stifel.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Hey, Tom. Thanks. I had a question, just broadly. A lot of the capital that's been deployed, in
terms of planting seeds in new businesses have worked out very well, but given what's happening right now in terms of
the deterioration in the margin structure as growth is slowing, I'm just wondering, and I think a lot of investors have
this question as well in terms of when things don't go as anticipated in some of the bigger projects where there's not a
revenue stream, like areas maybe like the – some of the hardware projects in China and other markets, what's the
process for determining whether to plow ahead or turn back capital and redeploy in other areas? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Thanks for the question, Scott. You know, with anything new that we do, and obviously
we've done, as you mentioned, we've done a lot of new things, there's certainly a wide range of outcome. And we
certainly understand that. We try to learn from everything that we do as we launch new opportunities. And so that's
something across things that go great and things that don't go as well as others. We try to learn from that. And so the
way I would describe it is from a looking forward standpoint. We still think that we have a lot of opportunities. That
said, we need to be very selective about what opportunities we pursue. And so that's, again, the way we're thinking
about it. And, you know, and probably not much more I can add to it than that.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure.
Operator
And we'll continue on to analyst Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Two questions, please. That $170 million in charges related to the Fire phone, where was
that put in the P&L, in which of the OpEx lines, or was it a COGS? And then secondly, on the media side, you talked
about maybe seeing a negative impact or definitely seeing a negative impact from the switch towards owning to
renting. Do you think that's a broader trend beyond just textbooks that affects all media retailers, including Amazon?
Could that be one of the issues behind the slow media growth in international markets? And if so, is there really a
solution to that other than your own rental models? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of the first question, the $170 million, it's predominantly in COGS. And so
it's – the very vast majority is in COGS. And then in terms of the split, about $25 million of that is in international and
the remainder is in North America.
In terms of the growth, we certainly are seeing that in textbooks. We do see, in other digital media we're certainly
seeing rentals being a part of our portfolio more than we had probably during, certainly with physical. But in terms of
some of the recent growth rates, the one that I called out related to book rentals are certainly impacting North American
media. One of the other things that's certainly impacting it, too, is we just had some things last year Q3 that were
overlapping, that were positive in Q3 last year from a demand standpoint. One was certainly in physical books. We had
a very heavy discounting which helped our growth in Q3 last year. We're overlapping that in Q3 this year.

<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks, Tom.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Thanks, Mark.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now go to analyst Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Hey there. And thanks for taking my question. Hoping we can go back to square one here
if you don't mind. Can you tell us or remind us, what financial measures are important to you guys, and which financial
measures do you hold yourselves and the board holds you accountable to? Because it's a little hard to see any of them
making positive progress so just we'd love to get back to basics.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. We're looking at a number of different metrics over a long period of time, and
certainly, our goal is to maximize free cash flow over the long-term. We don't focus on individual margins. But we do
focus on the inputs that are going to help drive free cash flow and operating income.
We certainly will look at making sure that we're using our capital wisely so that over time we get good returns on
invested capital. And we certainly have been in several years now of what I would call an investment mode, and
because of the opportunities that we've had in front of us, and as I mentioned earlier there is still lots of opportunity in
front of us, but we know that we have to be very selective about which opportunities we pursue, but we're encouraged
by the opportunities that we have.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Cash flow and return on invested capital is where we should keep our attention?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: And are the employees on the recruiting side, is that becoming more difficult as the stock
has faded a little bit and those return characteristics have faded? How are you making sure that you're hiring the best
people?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We have processes in place to make sure that we have a very high bar on the hiring that we
do. The people that we're hiring are extraordinary talented, we're very fortunate to get to work with so many talented
people here, and we've been fortunate to be able to grow that employment base to work on the opportunities that we
have.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll go to analyst Colin Gillis with BGC Financial.
<Q - Colin W. Gillis>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So just to get back to that North American media sales,
it was the lower growth rate in 20 years, are there – or 20 quarters. Are there other factors beyond the textbook shifts
and sort of the Q3 strength last year? Are the digital media trends still intact?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the principal drivers, it's the two that I mentioned, so it's the textbooks rentals,
and also overlapping some of the strong discounting, and strong titles that we had in some categories, so it's across a
number of categories within media, but those are the two principal drivers.
<Q - Colin W. Gillis>: And you don't see this as a broader shift in that number?

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: No. We're – it is still both in terms of North America and international, there's certainly a
shift that's going on from physical to digital, and that's something that we're spending a lot of time on, and trying to
improve the experience for customers, and we've been able to do that certainly over a period of time. And so it's
something we'll continue to work on.
<Q - Colin W. Gillis>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. We'll continue on with analyst Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two, please. If you could just update us on the
sortation center rollout, are all 15 online? And I'd love to know maybe how they've helped bridged the last mile and
improve overall speed delivery?
And the second question sort of switching gears and just focusing on advertising. I believe a pilot was launched or a
beta was launched for Amazon's add network called CPM ads, I think maybe late August. I'm wondering if you can
provide some commentary there. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of the sort centers, we have over 15 sort centers in the U.S. by the end of the
year. It's certainly helping us a lot. We have same day delivery in 12 cities. We'll have Sunday delivery in
approximately 50% of the population. And so we're pleased to do that. And in terms of the ad network, there's not a lot
I can say there.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.
<Q - Aaron M. Kessler>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us an update maybe on your views
on original programming? It looks like Transparent has had some good success. Also just from an international
standpoint, your views on maybe the growth in China, India as well as just are you seeing any signs of any increasing
competition in the international, your key international markets today? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of original content, we're excited about it. We're investing as we talked
about last quarter. We spent approximately $100 million in the quarter. Keep in mind that that's expensed in the
quarter. And so that's included in the results that you see in Q3. We're very excited about it. We have a number of pilots
as well as a number of series launched. Transparent, you mentioned, is one of them. It's got very good reviews. The
streaming on that series has been great, so we're very excited about it. And we think it's an interesting area for
customers. We continue to invest heavily in video content, including originals. And there's a number of different
metrics we're looking at certainly from a Prime standpoint. But what we are seeing so far is those customers who were
streaming are renewing at considerably higher rates, at a rate that's already high. So, we like what we see there.
When customers come in for new trials, free trials, and they engage from a video content standpoint, we see the
conversion being higher. So we see that we're adding new Prime members as a result of that. And when those Prime
members – when those new Prime members become Prime members, the other thing we're seeing is they're buying
physical product, which is a great impact for us.

We see very similar patterns in terms of how much physical product they're purchasing from us. And so we're still
certainly in investment mode there, but we like what we see. And we have a long way to go there, but we're
concentrating on building a great service. And we see that customers are rewarding us with engagement on the content,
both original and licensed, and they're buying more from us on the physical side and becoming Prime members when
they do and renewing at higher rates. So those are some of the early signs, and we'll continue to monitor it very closely.
But we're excited about what we're seeing there.
In terms of some of the international comments, and I would say this not just for international, but I'd say it for the U.S.
as well. One thing that's not new is, it's a very competitive environment. We have a lot of competitors, both online and
offline. That's not anything that's new. We're used to operating in that environment. We've been in that environment
really for 19 years. But we are seeing a lot of competition, and again, that's not new.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks. Last quarter you mentioned that the AWS business saw a 90% increase in
volume. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you've seen so far this quarter. And then in the highlight
section of the release, the first six bullet points or so that you have there are all related to the hardware side of the
business. If you can just sort of give us – now that you have a little bit more time on the hardware side of the business
behind you, if you can give us a sense of what you're learning in this category and where you think Amazon's long-term
position in hardware is ultimately going to be.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of AWS, we saw a very good growth in Q3 as well. From a usage standpoint, it's
very similar to Q2, close to 90%. And so the team is doing just a fantastic job. You can see our other revenue in North
America went up a little bit sequentially. And AWS is certainly the largest piece of that and it's the vast majority of it,
and they're growing at a faster rate than that other line number item.
So again the team is doing a fantastic job not only serving customers, but launching many, many new features and
services, and you can see some of the detail on that in the highlight section of our release today. So we're very excited
about it. In terms of devices, I can't speculate what we would do going forward, but we just launched a number of new
tablets and e-readers that we're excited about, and there's some really great price points for customers on the tablet side.
We also launched the kid's tablet which is the first time we've launched. We launched the new Kindles, including our
Premium Kindle, and it's a terrific product, we think it's the best Kindle we've made to date for sure, and so we're very
excited about that. And we're excited to have these offerings for customers.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equities Research.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Tom you mentioned that you need to get leverage at some point. In the last call you also said
something similar but can you help us quantify the timing. In your internal modeling, when do you expect to see more
meaningful leverage? And when you look at your three to five year outlook, what does the leverage picture look like
there? And then can you remind us about what your philosophy of stock buybacks is? And what it would take to get
you back in the market? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of leverage, beyond the guidance that we're giving today, there's not a lot of
certainty I can give you. But again, what I'd mentioned earlier is, we do have a lot of opportunities. But our job is to be

judicious and selective about which opportunities we pursue, and so that's the way we're thinking about it, and I
apologize I can't give you any more certainty in terms of timing, but certainly that's the way we're thinking about it. In
terms of buybacks, we have an open buyback right now. We have authorization to do that. I certainly can't comment on
what price points we would or wouldn't do there.
Operator
Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you. If you look at the phone impact in Q3, it seems to explain some of the difference
versus the Street, but when you look forward to Q4, it looks like you're guiding to about 15% to 16% growth ex-FX
and again of profits may be below some expectations. Is the phone having an impact on profits in Q4 as well? And also,
when you think about the Q4 guidance, are there any events or things you want to call out? Are you being especially
conservative in Q4 given recent trends? Anything different this year in the holiday? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes. In terms of the holiday season Justin, if you look back the last several years, I've been
giving wide ranges, because it's again our most seasonal quarter, always challenging to predict precisely where we're
going to be. So in terms of a dollar range, I gave a $3 billion range last year, I'm giving a $3 billion range again this
year from a revenue perspective. Again, wide range. At the higher end of the range, excluding foreign exchange, it's
approximately 21% so it's a little bit higher than what we saw in the Q3. And then you can see we are on the low end of
the range.
In terms of – but in terms of the season itself, we're very excited about it in terms to serve customers. We feel great
about the selection that we have added and are continuing to add for the holiday season. We think from a operation
standpoint, each year we try to get better, and we believe that we'll be even better this year than we have in previous
years. And so we're super excited to serve customers.
In terms of the phone, the only other thing that I can comment on is, at the end of the Q3 we had approximately $83
million worth of inventory on hand. And so I can't comment on how that would impact guidance or not, but that's the
amount ever inventory we had on hand at the end of Q3.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next analyst will be John Blackledge with Cowen & Co.
<Q - John R Blackledge>: Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. We saw that Amazon Fresh expanded into
Brooklyn recently. Just wondering if you can discuss the decision to expand into New York City and how we should
think about timing for expansion into other markets? And then if you can update us on the number of fulfillment
centers globally ending in the year, that would be great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of the number of fulfillment centers, it's 13 net for the year. And then on –
as I mentioned earlier, in the U.S. we'll have 15 sort centers by the end of – more than 14 – excuse me, more than 15
sort centers by the end of the year.
In terms of – sorry, the other part of the question was on Fresh? The team is doing a great job from a customer
experience standpoint. As you can see, we're in a few cities today. The team is just heads down focused on making sure
that experience is great for customers. We continue – customers like the service, so we're seeing good pickup there.
And as you mentioned, we're expanding into Brooklyn. I can't speculate on what we'd do beyond the cities that we have
launched to date, but we're excited about what we're seeing so far there.

<Q - John R Blackledge>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Eric Sheridan with UBS.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the question. Tom, you guys put through a price increase on the prime
services here. Was curious what you were seeing in terms of the impact of that price increase on both the rate of adding
people into Prime and the ability to control churn inside the Prime subscription base in general. And as you add
additional functionality and layers into Prime like you've done this year through the investments, whether you've
thought about maybe putting in another price increase through next year? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah. In terms of what we do going forward – I certainly wouldn't speculate. We had a
price point since our initiation of – excuse me, since the launch of Prime at $79, and so it took us a long time and we're
very careful with that to increase it to $99. But since we've increased to $99, we've had great retention. We're very
pleased with the retention we've had from customers. The program is growing very fast. We're very excited about it.
And so we do think it's really good for customers and it's really good for us and share owners over the long-term.
You're correct in that we're investing in Prime in a number ever different ways including video content.
As I talked about earlier, that is certainly the way we'll get a return on that investment principally will be customers
buying more, including especially physical products. So, again, we're very excited about Prime globally.
Operator
Thank you. Our next analyst will be Brian Nowak with SIG.
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, please. The first one, fulfillment ex-stock based
comp was the highest it's ever been as a percentage of gross profit in the third quarter. Can you just talk to the drivers
of that? Is that sortation centers or international growth? What's driving that? And then as we think about the sortation
centers, what's the impact of those over the next few quarters to fulfillment? Are they – do they take a while to kind of
get the inefficiencies out of the system like a standard DC would?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah. In terms of the fulfillment cost, you're right, we're adding 13 net fulfillment centers.
We added – we'll have over 15 sort centers at the end of the year. Certainly one of the drivers for that is certainly the
growth that we're experiencing, but in addition to that, what we're seeing is the FBA adoption continues to get better if
we get further penetrated with sellers adopting Fulfill by Amazon. We think that's really good for sellers, and for us,
and for customers over the long-term.
And what you're seeing is we're – several years ago for in terms of fulfillment center planning we were adding less of
them, and it was much closer to the holiday season with the sheer amount of capacity that we're adding, you're seeing
more of that come in even before Q4. So you're seeing that impacting us earlier, and the benefit of coming in earlier is
we get to serve customer, get up to the productivity rates that we want to, to serve customers in Q4 by having that
capacity in a bit earlier than in past. So we've seen that trend happen over the past few years where that's coming in
earlier than certainly historically we've been able to do.
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next analyst will be Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, Prime launched a referral fee recently, and I'm
wondering if we should take that as any indication that the membership growth has slowed, or you're seeing some

higher churn, and how does that referral fee get accounted for? And then secondly, Target launched free shipping with
no hurdle for the holidays versus your $35 hurdle. Just wondering what your willingness is to leave that competitive
gap during the holidays? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, I can't comment from a competitive standpoint what we might or might not do there.
But in terms of the Prime referral fee, no, you should not read into that, that Prime isn't growing well. In fact, just the
opposite. We're seeing great growth and we like the fact that enabling customers because they like Prime to be able to
refer others we think is great for us. And so I can't actually – maybe off-line you can follow-up with Phil or Dave on
the accounting. Off the top of my head I can't remember how that's working. But I know that they'll be able to answer it
for you.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. A couple of follow-ups. First off, in terms of the Q4
revenue guide, are you giving any consideration in that forecast to some of the shipping issues that happened last
holiday and the ability of your shipping partners to manage your growth? And then secondly, on paid units, can you
provide a splits or a color between physical and digital unit growth? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the guidance, it reflects all of the assumptions that we think could happen for
the quarter. So, again, it's a wide range. To speak specifically to some of the issues last year, the team, again, we are
continually trying to learn from everything that we do. And the team has done a great job learning from our experiences
coming out of Q4 last year, as we do every year and are excited to serve customers.
In terms of the unit growth, there's not a lot I can add in terms of splits other than the overall growth rate but we are
pleased with – certainly we're seeing good customer growth. Sellers are -we're doing, we think a great job for sellers.
We continue to add a lot of unique selection throughout the year in terms of – and behalf of customers. We see FBA for
sellers getting further and further penetrated. We've launched some we think some interesting products for customers.
We think our Web Services team is doing a great job. We realize that we have a lot of opportunities but we need to be
selective on which opportunities we pursue. And I think beyond that we're just overall excited and getting ready for the
holiday season.
Thomas J. Szkutak
So, anyway, thanks, everybody for calling in today.
Phil Hardin
Thank you for joining us today on the call, and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations
website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interesting interest in Amazon.com and look
forward to talking with you again next quarter.
