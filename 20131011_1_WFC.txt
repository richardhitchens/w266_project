John G. Stumpf
Thank you, Jim, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
Wells Fargo continued to demonstrate the benefit of our diversified business model generating record earnings in the
third quarter and achieving our 15th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth. While the drivers of our earnings
growth over this period have differed, reflecting the changing economic and interest rate environment, our focus on
meeting our customers' financial needs has remained the same.
There are currently some new economic challenges with the U.S. government shutdown and the possibility of the
government defaulting on its debt; but prior to these recent events, the economy had continued its pace of moderate
growth with gains in consumer spending, business investment and employment.
While the recovery remains uneven, there are many positive signs, including increased small business optimism and a
dramatic improvement in household net worth with household leverage now lower than any time since 2002, which
provides capacity for consumer spending and borrowing going forward.
The housing market also continues to demonstrate strong momentum. While, as expected, higher rates reduced
mortgage refinancing activity this quarter, home price appreciation remains strong and affordability remains excellent.
This improvement has benefited our customers and contributed to our overall credit performance.
Let me take a moment to comment on the current situation in Washington and how we think about the implications for
Wells Fargo. A prolonged government shutdown and potential debt ceiling breach is unnecessary and troublesome and
will likely create new needs for our customers and their families. I've asked our business leaders to identify ways we
can help our customers directly affected by the shutdown, whether it's furloughed government workers or a customer
distressed by agency closures; and we stand ready to assist our customers during this period.
More importantly, for our country, I feel it's important for our leaders in Washington to set aside partisan differences,
break the logjam and find workable solutions that are in the best interest of our nation and our economy. I'm
encouraged by the news coming out of the nation's capital yesterday.
We've managed through changing environments in the past, and our experience and visuals guide us through this
period of transition as well. Our results this quarter reflected the dynamic environment we are in and the benefit of our
diversity. Let me share some highlights.
Our record earnings of $5.6 billion and record earnings per share of $0.99 were up 13% from a year ago. Our core loan
portfolio grew by $44.2 billion, up 6%. This strong performance was broad-based with growth in our commercial and
consumer portfolios, reflecting organic growth and the acquisition of two commercial real estate portfolios.
Our credit performance was exceptional as we continue to benefit from our conservative underwriting and improving
economic conditions, especially in housing, with the net charge-offs down to 48 basis points annualized and our total
net charge-off dollars down 59% from a year ago. Our outstanding deposit franchise continue to generate strong deposit
growth with average deposits up $79.1 billion from a year ago, while reduced deposit cost by 6 basis points to just 12
basis points for the entire portfolio.
We deepened relationships across our company, achieving record retail banking cross-sell of 6.15 products per
household. Wholesale Banking grew their cross-sell to 7 products, and Wealth, Brokerage, Retirement cross-sell
increased to 10.41 products.
We had very strong returns, growing return on assets by 8 basis points to 1.53%, and return on equity increased by 69
basis points to 14.07%. Our capital levels continue to grow, and our estimated Tier 1 common equity under Basel III
increased to 9.54%, surpassing our stated 9% target. We look forward to the upcoming CCAR process where we expect
to request a higher dividend and an increase to our share repurchases.
Tim will now provide more details on our third quarter results. Tim?

Timothy J. Sloan
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly
supplement starting on page two. John and I will then take your questions. Our financial results this quarter
demonstrated the benefit of our diversity and our risk discipline as we continue to produce strong results. Wells Fargo
earned a record $5.6 billion and grew earnings per share to $0.99, both up 13% from a year ago. We've now achieved
15 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth and 10 consecutive quarters of record EPS.
As John highlighted and as you can see on page three, our year-over-year results reflected loan growth that was well
diversified, as well as strong deposit growth. Lower mortgage banking revenue resulted in a decline of pre-tax
pre-provision profit compared with a year ago. The higher rate environment, which has reduced mortgage refinancing
volume, has resulted in a transitional period for our mortgage business. We've expected and planned for lower
mortgage volumes and have managed through these periods in the past. I'll provide more detail on mortgage trends later
in the call. However, we're still able to grow earnings and increase returns, driven by strong net interest income, fee
growth across many of our businesses and significantly improved credit.
Our revenue diversification is highlighted on page four. Different businesses naturally contribute more or less to our
revenue depending upon the economic and interest rate environment, but our revenue remained almost evenly split
between net interest and non-interest income, and our sources of fee income were very well diversified. This is a
benefit of our business model. We don't rely on any one business to generate growth.
Let me start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our third quarter results from a balance sheet and income
statement perspective, starting on page five. Our balance sheet has never been stronger. We increased earning assets by
growing loans and purchasing securities. We continue to strengthen our capital levels even as we return more capital to
our shareholders.
Let me take a moment to highlight our improved liquidity position. While we believe our liquidity position was already
strong, with heightened regulatory expectations we've been adding to our position over the past few months. We
increased long-term debt and term deposits at very low rates and most of the proceeds went into cash and short-term
investments. While building our liquidity put some pressure on our net interest margin, it did not impact our bottom
line.
Turning to the income statement on page six. Net interest income remained strong, driven by a $23.3 billion increase in
average earning assets. Mortgage revenue declined as expected, but we had growth in other fee categories. Our
expenses declined, driven by lower personnel expense and lower operating losses.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.9%. During the quarter, we finalized settlements with tax authorities
regarding prior period tax issues primarily associated with certain cross-border transactions. Primarily due to these
settlements, we recorded a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions, which resulted in a tax benefit in the
third quarter of $166 million.
Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page seven, we continue to have strong loan
growth, with period-end loans up $29.7 billion, or 4%, from a year ago and up $10.3 billion from the second quarter.
Excluding our liquidating portfolio, our core portfolio grew by $44.2 billion, or 6%, from a year ago and was up $13.8
billion from the second quarter.
Commercial loans grew $8.5 billion in the quarter with broad-based organic growth, and $5.2 billion from acquisitions.
Consumer loans grew $1.8 billion, with growth in nonconforming first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and private
student lending, partially offset by the expected runoff from the liquidating portfolio and core home equity loans.
Even during the period, with tepid industry loan growth, we've been able to grow our loans on a year-over-year basis
for nine consecutive quarters. And for the past six quarters, year-over-year growth has been at least 3%, despite runoff
from our liquidating portfolio. Our growth is the result of remaining committed to meeting the financing needs of our
customers and benefiting from opportunities to grow through acquisitions.

On slide eight we highlight the drivers of our loan growth from a year ago. Real estate 1 through 4 family first
mortgage loans grew $14.4 billion, or 6%, even with the runoff from our liquidating portfolio, and included growth in
high-quality nonconforming mortgages and the retention of conforming mortgages.
C&I loans were up $13.5 billion, or 8%. We have broad-based growth in asset-backed finance, government banking,
corporate banking and commercial banking.
Foreign loans grew $6.9 billion, or 17%, which included $4 billion from the UK CRE acquisition we completed in the
quarter as well as trade finance growth. Auto loans were up $3.6 billion, or 8%, reflecting continued strong
originations. Credit card balances were up $1.8 billion, or 7%, with strong new account growth reflecting increased
card penetration as well as marketing efforts.
Deposit growth remains strong with average deposits up $15.8 billion in the second quarter and up $79.1 billion, or 8%,
from a year ago. We grew our primary consumer checking customers by a net 3.9% from a year ago, up from 3.5% last
quarter. The growth in these relationship-based customers should benefit our future results as we remain focused on
meeting more of our customers' needs.
We continue to reduce deposit costs, which were down 6 basis points from a year ago and 2 basis points from the
second quarter. We've successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit costs for 10 consecutive quarters, with
average deposit cost declining to 12 basis points in the third quarter. Our strong deposit performance over an extended
period of time is a fundamental strength of our franchise.
As shown on page 10, tax equivalent net interest income remained strong. Our ability to grow net interest income over
the past year while the net interest margin has declined 28 basis points reflected the benefit of our loan growth and our
disciplined approach to investing. Net interest income was essentially unchanged from the second quarter, benefiting
from one additional day in the quarter, higher securities balances, loan growth and lower funding costs. These benefits
were offset by an expected decline in mortgages held for sale and lower variable income.
Average earning assets grew $23.3 billion from the second quarter, reflecting increases in short-term investments, AFS
securities and loans. We purchased $19.8 billion of AFS securities, primarily in the form of agency MBS, during the
third quarter prior to the decline in rates late in the quarter.
While our net interest income remains stable, our net interest margin declined by 8 basis points from the second quarter
to 3.38%. This decline was driven by four primary factors. First, our continued deposit growth, which has little impact
on net interest income but is dilutive to the NIM, reduced the margin by 3 basis points. The liquidity-related actions
that we took in the quarter reduced the margin by 3 basis points also. The net impact of balance sheet repricing and
growth reduced the margin by 1 basis point. And finally, variable income, which includes PCI loan resolutions and
periodic dividends, was lower this quarter and reduced the margin by 1 basis point. We currently expect continued net
interest margin pressure.
Noninterest income was down $898 million from the second quarter, driven primarily by lower mortgage refinance
volume and reduced gain on sale margins, which I'll highlight shortly. Because the reduction in mortgage revenue and
the impact from seasonality on a link quarter basis can make it difficult to demonstrate the underlying momentum we
have in many of our businesses, it's helpful to look at our year-over-year trends excluding mortgage.
On page 11, we show noninterest income excluding mortgage banking, and you can see that we grew 5% compared
with a year ago. Let me highlight some of the momentum we have across a number of our businesses. Deposit service
charges were up $68 million from a year ago, benefiting from strong account growth. Trust and investment fees were
up $322 million, with strong growth in brokerage asset-based fees and investment banking. Card fees were up $69
million, benefiting from strong account growth and increased usage in both our credit and debit card business.
Commercial real estate brokerage commissions grew $35 million from strong private and public market activity. Equity
gains were up $338 million, reflecting gains from several transactions in the quarter. Equity gains are naturally volatile
on a quarterly basis. But on a year-to-date basis, gains are only up $48 million compared with 2012.

We're in a transitional period in our mortgage business. As expected, with the increase in mortgage rates, our mortgage
origination volume declined this quarter, particularly refinance activity, as highlighted on page 12.
We've managed through many refi cycles in the past and remain committed to the mortgage business, which is an
important product for our customers and benefits from our cross-sell focus. We originated $80 billion of mortgages in
the third quarter. And with the rise in rates, refi volume declined to 41% of originations, down from 56% in the second
quarter and down from 71% in the first quarter of 2012.
Purchase volume remained relatively strong in the third quarter, down 4% from the second quarter, benefiting from the
continued strong housing market. Our unclosed pipeline declined to $35 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting
lower application volume and shorter processing times to close mortgage loans as capacity has increased. If rates
remain where they are today, we would expect lower origination volume in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower refi
volume and normal fourth quarter seasonality in the purchase market.
Our gain on sale margin declined from the historically high levels we experienced for the past year to 1.42%. As rates
seem to have stabilized and competition has remained rational, we currently expect the margin to remain relatively
steady in the fourth quarter. Reflecting lower origination volume, we had lower incentive compensation expenses
related to mortgage production in the quarter.
We announced reductions of 5,300 mortgage FTEs in the third quarter, which increased our severance cost. Most of the
expense reduction from the lower FTEs was not reflected in our expense numbers for the third quarter because of the
notice period we provided to our team members. But we should begin to see a reduction in expenses more significantly
during the fourth quarter, and we will continue to manage our capacity based on demand.
While higher mortgage rates reduced our mortgage refi volume, they benefit our servicing business. Our servicing
revenue was up $111 million from the second quarter, benefiting from a slowdown in the economic amortization of
mortgage servicing rights.
As we announced last week, we had recent agreement with Freddie Mac that resolves substantially all repurchase
liabilities for loans sold prior to 2009. The cost of this agreement was fully accrued for in prior periods. As a result, our
outstanding repurchase demands were down 25% from the second quarter. And for the first time in over five years, we
did not add to our repurchase reserve in the third quarter other than for reserves established for current period loan
sales.
Expenses declined $153 million from the second quarter, as shown on page 13. Salary expense was up $142 million,
which included $63 million in mortgage related severance expense. Incentive compensation expense was down $225
million, driven by lower mortgage revenue and lower capital markets and retail brokerage activity. Expenses also
reflected lower operating losses, down $93 million, primarily from lower litigation accruals.
The environmentally elevated costs primarily related to our residential mortgage business that we've highlighted over
the last few quarters have been significantly reduced. However, over time, we do expect to recognize additional
benefits from a continued improvement in the housing market, including additional reductions to these costs.
We had higher expenses related to the regulatory environment and our compliance activities. We had a long history of
strong risk management practices; and in response to the heightened regulatory environment, our expenses increased by
approximately $200 million annually. Our efficiency ratio rose to 59.1% in the quarter reflecting the immediate impact
of the reduction in mortgage origination volume. We expect our efficiency ratio to improve in the fourth quarter and we
continue to target an efficiency ratio of between 55% and 59%.
Turning to our business segments, starting on page 14. Community Banking earned $3.3 billion in the third quarter, up
3% from the second quarter and up 22% from a year ago. Retail banking continued to consistently grow cross-sell,
achieving a record of 6.15 products per household, up from 6.04 a year ago.
We continue to benefit from momentum in the credit card business by growing accounts, purchase volumes and
balances. We had record new accounts, up 9% from a year ago, and household penetration increased to 36%, up from
32% a year ago and 28% just two years ago as we continue to increase marketing and enhance our product line. The

14% increase in purchase volume from a year ago reflects this account growth and an increase in active accounts.
Credit card balances were up 3% from the second quarter and up 7% from a year ago. We also had strong loan growth
in our auto business, with balances up 2% from the second quarter and up 8% from a year ago. Originations were down
3% from the second quarter due to seasonality, but up 9% from a year ago.
By remaining focused on serving the needs of all our small business customers, we were once again America's number
one small business lender in dollars for the 11th consecutive year. We extended $14.2 billion in new loan commitments
to small business customers during the first nine months of 2013, up 24% from a year ago.
Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter, down 2% from the second quarter with lower sales and
trading, investment banking and seasonally lower crop insurance fees.
Earnings were down 1% from a year ago, as the lower sales and trading income offset growth in other commercial
businesses and strong loan and deposit growth. While revenue was down from a year ago, we had strong momentum
across a number of our commercial businesses, including a 10% increase in treasury management revenue. This growth
was driven by strong sales growth, including continued penetration of existing customers, as well as new customer
growth and pricing increases.
In addition, commercial card treasury management spend volume increased 22% compared with the year ago.
Wholesale Banking also benefited from growth in assets under management, with AUM up 6% from a year ago, driven
by strong net inflows and market performance. Wholesale Banking's cross-sell grew to 7 products per relationship, up
from 6.7 a year ago.
Wholesale Banking results continue to benefit from consistent loan growth, with loans having grown for 12
consecutive quarters. Average loans grew 5% compared with the year ago and was broad-based, with growth coming
from nearly all our portfolios including asset-backed finance, capital finance, commercial banking, commercial real
estate, corporate banking, equipment finance and government and institutional banking. As I mentioned earlier, loan
growth also benefited from U.K. and U.S. commercial real estate acquisitions.
Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $450 million in the third quarter, up 4% from the second quarter, driven by
higher net interest income and improved credit quality, partially offset by seasonally lower brokerage transaction
revenues. Earnings were up 33% from the year ago, driven by strong growth in asset-based fees, higher net interest
income and improved credit quality. Revenue grew 9% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in asset-based fees
and higher net interest income.
Retail brokerage managed account assets grew to a record $350 billion, up 18% from a year ago, driven by strong
market performance and net flows. WBR has strong balance sheet growth with average loans and deposits up 10%
from a year ago. Loan balances were up 3% from the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of linked quarter
growth. The benefit of meeting all the financial needs of our customers was also reflected in WBR's steadily increasing
cross-sell, growing to 10.41 products per household in the third quarter, up from 10.27 a year ago.
Turning to credit quality on page 17, our strong performance reflected our long-term risk focus and the benefit from the
improving housing market. Third quarter net charge-offs declined to historically low levels, only 48 basis points of
average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only $19 million or 2 basis points of average loans. Consumer
losses declined to 86 basis points.
We continue to have especially strong improvement in our commercial and residential real estate portfolios. Our
commercial real estate portfolios were once again in a net recovery position. And our consumer real estate portfolios
reduced their losses by $1.2 billion from a year ago, down 70%.
Reflecting these improvements, our provision expense declined $577 million from the second quarter to $75 million
and included a $900 million reserve release, compared with the release of $500 million in the second quarter. Given
current favorable conditions, we continue to expect future reserve releases, absent a significant deterioration in the
economy.

In addition to lower charge-offs and provision expense, nonperforming assets also improved with NPAs down $360
million from the second quarter. Nonaccrual loans declined $1 billion, while foreclosed assets increased $662 million,
driven by an increase in government-insured foreclosed assets. The increase was primarily driven by enhancements for
loan modification programs, slowing foreclosures in prior quarters.
Loans 90 days or more past due decreased $104 million from the second quarter and were down 30% from a year ago,
with improvement in both commercial and consumer loans. Early-stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates
also declined from the second quarter and from a year ago.
Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III increased to 9.54%, exceeding our target of 9% for the first
time, which includes a 100 basis point internal capital buffer. The growth in the Basel III ratio demonstrated our strong
underlying earnings performance and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, reflecting an improved company credit
profile and model refinements for commercial portfolios.
In addition, after the Basel rules were finalized, we took a number of actions to reduce RWA. We disposed of an asset
that had a cumulative risk rating and generated and evaluated more granular data on underlying investments for BOLI
assets.
We reduced our common share count by $28.4 million from the second quarter. We purchased 50.9 million shares and
we executed a $400 million forward contract that is expected to settle in the fourth quarter for approximately 9.8
million shares. We are focused on returning more capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
In summary, we had another solid quarter by focusing on our vision of meeting customers' financial needs, resulting in
strong loan growth and deposit growth. We benefited from a continued improvement in credit quality with losses down
significantly, reflecting our conservative underwriting and an improvement in the economy, especially the rebound in
housing. Our ROA and ROE continued to grow. And we had strong capital generation, which will benefit us as we
enter the upcoming CCAR process.
We'll now open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning. My first question...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning. With the provision at $75 million this quarter and your efficiency ratio at
59%, to continue the record quarterly earnings growth for next quarter it seems like you have to move to the midpoint
of your efficiency ratio. I guess, the question really here is can you get to the midpoint of your efficiency ratio next
quarter all through cutting mortgage expense?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, Erika, I would push back a little bit on the math there because that just assumes that we
only have one lever to pull and that's expenses. And if you step back and look at the performance that we had this
quarter, you saw broad-based growth across the company. There's no question that the efficiency ratio deteriorated a
little bit, but that was just because of the immediate impact of the mortgage revenue decline. Our expectation for all of
our businesses is that we're going to see growth over time.
We believe that we're going to improve the expense efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter, and we're hopeful that credit
continues to improve. And as I mentioned, we believe that we can – that we'll have further loan loss reserve releases.
So I don't think it's necessarily going to be one item that's going to impact our earnings next quarter, and that's really

been the case for the last 15 quarters. Every quarter is a little bit different. And that's fine because we've got the
diversity and the strength in our businesses to be able to grow regardless of what's thrown at us.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. So I guess the message there is we should expect efficiency improvement next
quarter and you'll get there through both – on both sides of the denominator? Sorry, both sides of the equation,
denominator and numerator?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. That's correct. We expect our efficiency ratio to improve in the fourth quarter from the
third quarter results.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, Erika, if you look at – and you do – at the balance sheet, just think of the growth we had
this quarter and the last number of quarters in loans. That's the first call in our liquidity. Secondly, we do have liquidity,
ample liquidity there. This past quarter we were able, as we have in recent quarters, to deal with liability costs. So there
are lots of things going on here. And as Tim mentioned, the expense side is an important side, but it's not the only lever.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And my second question and I'll step back is on capital return for next year. I think
we hear you loud and clear that we should expect more capital return next year versus this year. And my question is
really on the CCAR process. Given sort of the fluidity on U.S. leverage standards and global leverage standards, which
doesn't impact you as much as other large banks, but I guess how do the regulators think of the buyback authorizations
that they approve relative to the fluidity of the new leverage rules?
I guess the real question there is without the leverage proposals being final in the U.S. or globally, will they allow
banks to announce large authorizations on buybacks thinking that if something changes with the rules or the rules are
just as stringent as proposed, you could dial back your actual buyback relative to your authorization?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Here's how we think about that. If you think about the CCAR process, we now have – every
year we do this, we learn more, we have more experience. Rules that were proposed are becoming more known. Not
everything is known today, but this CCAR process we'll know a lot more about final rules than we knew in the past.
That doesn't mean everything is known.
Secondly, we have made great progress. And Tim mentioned and I mentioned in our comments that if you look at just
one ratio, but we don't look at only one, the Tier 1 common using Basel III rules as we understand them, we're over the
7% plus the 1% SIFI buffer gets us 8% plus our self-imposed 1% to 9%, we're already 9.50%, north of 9.50%.
And in our company, the way you run it here is really about shareholder. And you saw the activity we had last year in
returning capital to our stockholders. We purposely made a comment, both Tim and I did, about returning more to our
shareholders and we're looking forward to this upcoming CCAR process. It's surely an iterative process. It's
collaborative with the Federal Reserve. I don't want to get ahead of that process. But I know you appreciate how much
we care about returning, and we're in a great position to do that. So let's see where it all ends up.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning. Tim, I was wondering...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, John. I was wondering on the liquidity additions, Tim, was this in preparation for
your expectation on what the rules will be on LCR or OLA or both? And do you anticipate doing more of this liquidity
build in coming quarters or are you positioned for your kind of best read of what you expect from these rules?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. A very good question. I'm glad you ask it. It had nothing to do with OLA, which
primarily focused on just liquidity. We've always operated the company with sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of
our customers and also weather the volatility in the markets, and we've seen a lot of volatility over the last few years for
sure. But that said, there's no question that the regulatory expectations for the industry have increased, and we've been
building liquidity throughout the year.
And I think the important thing is that throughout the year, as well as in this quarter, it didn't affect our ability to serve
customers, invest in securities when rates were higher or, as you've seen, report another quarter of record earnings. But
we did accelerate the liquidity build this quarter and we're able to do so in a way that was favorable because of the
strong balance sheet that we have.
To your question about the standards, we don't know what the domestic standard is going to be. Our expectation is that
will be announced sometime toward the end of this year. But as it relates to the international standard, we've exceeded
that. But again, we don't want to make a big deal about that because that's not really the standard that we're going to
operate under, it's going to be the domestic standard. But I wouldn't worry about our ability to have sufficient liquidity
to meet the standards, to serve our customers, to continue to generate earnings.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And on the mortgage side, any sense for how much the mortgage originations
could fall in the fourth quarter? And can we look at the decline in the end of the quarter pipeline as a guide to the
possible magnitude from a decline from the $80 billion level or what's the danger of us doing that?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. Well, there's always danger in something, right, John?
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yeah.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: But I think a big driver for mortgage origination volume is going to be where rates turn out.
We've seen that in great form this last quarter. Assuming that we're going to stay in this current interest rate
environment, our expectation is that the mortgage originations will be down. The reason that I didn't provide any more
specific guidance is that we're early in the quarter.
Having said that, I wouldn't use the point-to-point reduction in pipeline as the primary driver for coming up with any
sort of expectation about mortgage origination volume, because what we're experiencing right now in terms of the
business is that the closing times from origination to close on a mortgage are shortening up. It's the case for us, as well
as I'm sure the entire industry. So I wouldn't jump to that conclusion. Assume they're going to be down, but in terms of
exactly how much, I really – it would be premature to guess right now.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: John, I think the thing that we should all remember on the mortgage business is, while
refinance volume is down and it has a impact on us, the improvement in housing is really good for America, good for
our customers and ultimately good for our company. And we've been through these cycles before. And affordability
still remains very attractive, household leverage has come down, and the interest by Americans in home ownership is
still there. So this is just a great thing. People are feeling better, and we'll respond as volumes go up and down and so
forth. We've done that in the past. But an improving housing market is good. It's good for everyone.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thanks, John. And one quick follow-up. Tim, if the current credit trends
persist, is there any reason we couldn't see the reserve releases remain at the current level in this $900 million ballpark
we saw this quarter?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, John, I'd hesitate to provide you with a specific number because that's a process that we
decide at the end of the quarter. I do think, as we said, that you should have an expectation that we will continue to
have reserve releases because of the trends that we're seeing, not only in terms of the continued improvement in our
portfolio but because of the continued improvement in home prices. So we'll have a release in the fourth quarter. I don't
know what it's going to be, but you should count on us having a release.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Excluding acquisitions on the end-of-period basis, it looked like core loan growth
strengthened a bit in the quarter. How do you feel about demand through year-end and how much of these uncertainties
around the government shutdown and the debt ceiling are affecting customer sentiment at this point?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. I would say that it's a little bit too soon to gauge the impact as to what the – how
consumers and our commercial customers are going to react to what's going on or not going on in Washington. But the
trends that we saw in the fourth quarter or – excuse me, in the third quarter, as you said, ex the acquisition are
continuing. So I don't know what the growth is going to be, but I think what we were really excited about in the third
quarter was how broad-based loan growth was.
It wasn't just in one of our portfolios in wholesale, it wasn't just in WBR, it wasn't just in one of the consumer
portfolios. So it's broad-based. And this gets back to John's comments about the recovery, again, setting what's going
on in Washington aside, we're in the midst of a recovery. It's a little bit uneven, but because of our diversification we're
able to pick up wherever the loan growth might be. And again, I think it's really a testament to the team that we have
out there dealing with customers every day, because we're continuing to grow at a multiple of what the underlying
industry is growing at.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: And you announced a couple of loan portfolio acquisitions in the quarter. Do you expect to
see more of these opportunities in coming months and just how competitive are these situations, given that industry
loan growth overall is fairly sluggish?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, you know what, Joe? You've got to pay the highest price to win, so they're always
going to be competitive. But we've been very pleased over the last two years to have been in the position, because of
our financial condition, our liquidity, our capital position, to be able to acquire a number of loan portfolios. We're
hopeful that we'll continue to see opportunities to make acquisitions of good-quality loan portfolios in the future.
We certainly don't count on it, and we don't assume that we need it to be able to grow earnings. But the short answer is
there is competition out there. But the fact of the matter is that we're viewed as a good counterparty to sell to because
we've got very experienced people that can provide good underwriting. We're able to transform that into competitive
bids, and when we say we're going to close, we close.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Tim's absolutely right on that. And I think it's a competitive advantage we have for those
reasons. But we also, and you know this, we don't do every deal we look at. I mean, we look at a number of things and
transactions. If it doesn't add to our customer base, I mean, these are not only loans, these are customers, and we're
doing more things with them besides just the loan. And as you go through a number of these, it's logical that there'll be
fewer available, but we still, as I always say, kick a lot of tires. But the ones we bring home are the ones that really add
value to our customer base.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Betsy.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Just a couple of questions on mortgage expense side. I'm wondering if you could just give us
a sense of the amount of mortgage expense reduction you already have in your 3Q run rate? And roughly how far along
you think you are in that reduction based on current volumes, and when you think you get to your new run rate of
expense there?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. Betsy, it's a real good question. The primary reduction in expenses in the third quarter
from the mortgage business was really in the incentive compensation line, which we mentioned.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Most of the 5,300 team members that were noticed in the third quarter were still with us as of
the end of the quarter. So most of that expense, just the underlying personnel expense, was not out of the run rate. So
you're going to see that come out of the run rate during the fourth quarter. And our expectation is that as we start the
first quarter it will be completely out of the run rate. So not a lot of reduction with the exception of incentive comp in
the third quarter metering through the fourth quarter and then out in the first quarter.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: In fact, Tim's right. Actually it's a little bit – it's even – we actually took a charge in the third
quarter for severance. So it actually went through the expense numbers. So you can almost argue that it was elevated by
$63 million or so, whatever the – but Tim is right. The direct variable is out, but the support cost actually in an unusual
way went up for the quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And then on the MSR valuation, with the backup in rates, I guess I was a little bit surprised
not to see a higher upward revaluation. Maybe you could speak a little bit to how you got to your number?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. There's no question that we've had obviously a bit of a backup in rates, but we did
reduce the value of the MSR by about $240 million. And the driver for that was the assumption that we have regarding
prepayments during the quarter because of the increase in home values. And again, we try to appropriately hedge the
portfolio. So the impact was primarily driven by the change in the estimate of prepayments.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So the LTV is outweighing the rate impact still?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So far that's correct.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just one last thing, you have your card partnership that you announced
recently with American Express.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about offering that product versus your
other card products. I mean, how do you determine which one you're going to be marketing to your different client
bases? And maybe if you could let us understand if there is a merchant angle to the AmEx partnership as well.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Betsy, that's an area of opportunity and focus for our company. And this – just a little bit of
history here, when we put Wells and Wachovia together in fact we announced it almost five years ago to this date, they
had of course sold their card portfolio to MBNA; and when we put the two companies together we had something like a
18% or 20% penetration to our customer base. Today it happens to be 35%, 36%. We're really growing that. But we
knew and understood there was a client base within our customer base who call us their bank, who carry a card, but not
our card, and it tended to be in some cases a high-end card or it was a card that fit really nicely with what we're now

partnering with American Express.
And we all have a personal goal around here to satisfy all of our customers' needs and help them succeed financially;
and we're not satisfied here with a 35% or 36% penetration into our customer base on card. Every one of our card
customers has a card. They probably have more than one card. We want our card to be at the top of the wallet. And by
expanding our partnership to American Express in some spaces, this is going to be hugely valuable in helping us do
that.
It's not only from the economics of the card, it's from the payments, knowing our customers better and so forth. And
you're right, we do a lot of things on the issuing side, and this will help us there. But we're also a big company on the
acquiring side, the merchant side. And we'll be sharing more of that as time goes on, but we're really excited about
continuing to grow the penetration of our customers who carry our card.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Hey, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Matt.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: I was just hoping to drill down on the expenses a little bit. Obviously as we go forward
there is the severance coming out, there is the capacity reduction in mortgage that has already taken place. I would
assume some more to come as pressure comes down. But can you give us a sense of what the all-in run rate of expenses
may be for the revenue environment that you see out there?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: No. We don't look at the expense number as a number and we're not going to be able to
provide the guidance. I certainly appreciate why you asked the question. We really look at our performance based upon
the efficiency rate. And we provided guidance year-and-a-half ago that we want to be in the 55% to 59% range. It
deteriorated, as I mentioned a bit this quarter because of the immediate impact of the mortgage revenue decline. We are
going to improve our efficiency in the fourth quarter and we're going to continue to look at our expenses based upon
our efficiency ratio because it's got to be as a percentage of revenues.
Matty, it would not be difficult if we wanted to just to cut expenses. The problem is, when you look at your expenses
just in terms of dollars and you just focus on a dollar reduction, you have the propensity, and we've seen this with lots
of companies over the years, than give up revenues, and we are not going to do that. But this is a revenue-focused
company that's got to deliver expenses efficiently and we're going to continue to do that. So, again, I appreciate the
question, but we're not going to provide any dollar guidance.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: And just one added comment. We still believe, and we've mentioned this I think every
quarter, that we have opportunities. We're spending more in some areas, compliance, risk and so forth. And on the
other hand, we continue to innovate with our customers, with our delivery models. I mean, our neighborhood store in
Washington, D.C., has an operating cost basis 40% less than a traditional store. So we – and we're making investments
at the ATM about taking paper out and all kinds of things so, but never at the expense of serving customers or at the
expense of walking away from revenue. There's always a balance there. And that's why we have – we talk in terms of
an efficiency ratio. And we still feel comfortable with those guardrails.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: And obviously a lot of stuff has come up so far on the call. But just thinking out beyond the
fourth quarter to next year, I mean it seems like it is going to be a tough revenue environment for a lot of folks
including you guys and even beyond mortgage cost save, it does feel like there is other opportunities. So I think over
time to put some numbers around that might be helpful. Just separately on the sale of MSRs over time, any sense or

color that you can provide in terms of how meaningful those could be both in just an absolute sense and I guess from
like a gain perspective?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, I – Matt, I wouldn't look for us to start to sell MSRs just from a gain perspective. I
think, as we've talked about in the past, we do think it's prudent from a risk management standpoint to look at them as
our portfolio and take advantage of the fact there's more demand for mortgage servicing rights today than there was six
months ago, a year ago. So don't be surprised if we do sell some of our MSRs. I don't expect it to be a material
reduction, but I think from a risk management standpoint, it's good to go ahead and test the waters every once in a
while, and you should expect that we'll probably be doing that in the next few quarters.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: And, Matt, as far as going forward, you mentioned the next few quarters and what we're
excited about here is, you look at, first of all, you look at the absolute performance of the company in a pretty difficult
environment: north of 14% return on equity and an ROA north of 1.50%. But if you look at the liquidity we have now
on the balance sheet, almost $200 billion, and the first call on that is for serving customers' loans.
You look at the opportunity we have in certain businesses like Card and Wealth, Brokerage, and Retirement and
Insurance Distribution in addition to all the existing businesses, our ability to grow loans, outgrow our – the industry.
There's also a lot of opportunity here. Surely headwinds, we get that, but not foreign to us and that's why we like this,
as we've many times talk about, the 85 to 90 horses that pulled this coach along in being in different businesses.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Hey.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Marty, thanks for being a Dodgers fan by the way.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Oh, I appreciate that. You never know what you're going to get asked when you get out
there. I have two technical kind of mortgage questions and I had one general kind of balance sheet question. On the
gain on sale margin dropping from 2.20% down to around 1.40%, the curiosity I had was because you recognize your
gain on sale at closing or funding, a lot of times we have a spike in interest rates, you have a closed rate that actually
increases pretty substantially and can create a loss. I didn't know if the acceleration of the drop in this gain on sale
margin wasn't tied somewhat to that phenomenon which is pretty unusual and only happens when you have these real
dramatic shifts in rates like we just went through.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, Marty, you raise a good point and you're going in the right direction, but it wasn't
because of any sort of a loss. I think very frequently when you're in a period of a decline in rate as you're referring to,
you do get an acceleration in terms of the decline in rate of your margin. I would describe that as more of a competitive
impact as well as sometimes a mix impact from whether your originations are coming from the retail or a
correspondent business. So there was no question that because of the rapid increase in rate, there was a more rapid
decline in the margin. That said, our expectation given if you believe that interest rates have more or less stabilized
right now and also given the competitive environment that we think that the margin is more or less going to stay in this
range for the next quarter.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: The – and just to kind of hit on that one last time was did you have any pull-through in
the sense of when you are doing refis, you kind of think there is always going to be some breakage. Was there any

increase in the closure rate as the rates went higher because the refi folks just want to go in and make sure they had that
locked in rate?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, I wouldn't say that. I mean, I do think when, what we did see toward the end of the
quarter, once rates started to come down the last few weeks of the month, it did see an increase in volume on a daily
basis just because there were folks that were hoping to have refinanced. And then once they saw rates arise they put the
brakes on that and then when they saw rates fall, they wanted to take advantage of it, but beyond that, nothing more.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay. And then the other technical question on mortgage was when you are looking at
the servicing hedging, you use swaps – the majority of your hedging is in swaps and when the rates went up, you can
really kind of restructure that swap portfolio to where you can start to increase the positive carry. And I just didn't
know if you had the chance to take advantage of that with that spike in rates that we got in the third quarter.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, there's no question that with the volatility in rates, we needed to watch our hedging
very, very closely, and there was more volatility in that this quarter. But we really – but we didn't – just because of
where rates went this quarter, we didn't change the fundamental strategy in terms of how we hedge or the hedge ratios
to try to speculate on where rates are going to go. We really want to look at that servicing business based upon on the
hedge carry and not try to either increase it or decrease it too much based upon where rates are going.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And all I was getting at is you can kind of keep the same hedge ratio while taking
advantage of a wider, steeper yield curve. Sometimes there is a benefit related to that. So I was just curious if that is
something that you were able to take advantage of when you had that opportunity?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, not materially. No.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay. And then lastly, John, you brought up the fact that your liquidity had increased so
substantially – I mean it is around $200 billion, which is about twice what it was last year. So as much as you try to eat
into that with purchases in the securities portfolio or loan growth, the deposit growth just keeps outpacing what you're
able to do on the asset side. What's your thoughts that as this number gets to be so substantial, how you take that and
begin to utilize it given the opportunities that you have right now?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure. Well, I think that's one of the hidden strengths here in the company, in that the loan – the
customers that are looking to borrow money, we think they have the first call on that. We surely will be thoughtful
about making investments as we see backups. So there's a lot of what I would call dry powder there that's available.
And a lot of that is just because of what the deposit growth has been. I mean, we've grown deposits over the last year
by about $79.1 billion or $80 billion, and we brought even the cost of deposits down by 6 basis points, down to 12 basis
points. So – and I've said this I think in the past, and you know this, that we're not turning away customers. If a
customer – and we grow, we've been growing our primary checking accounts by 3.6% to 3.9% depending whether
you're talking about small business or consumer, they bring a lot of this stuff to us when they do this. And even though
it might not look like a great trade today or tomorrow, it's a fabulous trade over time. I'll take all of the customer
households with all of the checking accounts and all the balances they want to bring here because it's going to pay huge
dividends.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And just a slight follow-up to that is – and this is a tough question. How much of this
$200 billion do you all estimate is related – is sustainable through the cycle and not just temporarily parked on your
balance sheet? And thanks for all the time this morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I think when it comes to primary accounts, they're very sticky. And if you look at the makeup
of the liability side of our balance sheet, of the $1.30 trillion or $1.40 trillion, only about $40 billion in CDs. I mean,
these are accounts that people – they're transaction accounts, they're checking accounts, savings accounts. And that's
where people believe and they, if you ask where they bank, they'll say they bank at Wells Fargo because that's where
their basic and main account is. It's the driver of almost every sale on the retail side. So very much the lion's share of
that is core. If rates back up, will there be some disintermediation? Yeah, likely within – maybe even within the
company, but probably a lot less than other companies that – or others that would have more one-product households,
so-called hot money, that's just not who we are.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. How important is it to have consecutive quarters of increasingly higher EPS growth? And I
will get back to my question in a second. I know it is probably an outcome of the way you run the business.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Mike, that's exactly right. It's an outcome. We don't set about trying to hit a certain earnings
number. What we do is we try to set about serving our customers' needs and the earnings are just an outcome. The fact
that we highlight it is something because we're proud of it. We've had 270,000 people working really, really hard for
the last quarter in a pretty interesting environment where there have been a lot of headwinds. We've talked about some
of them, and we're very proud of their performance. We hope that continues, but it's an outcome, not a goal.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And I know I've asked the question on past conference calls, how do you mind the gap from the
time when mortgage revenues decline and you don't yet have a chance to cut expenses? And it seems like the answer
this quarter was partly reserve releases, which equaled over one-tenth of your earnings for the quarter. So I'm trying to
understand the offsets a little bit better and you've touched on a lot of them. But what sort of expense or efficiency
gains should you get from those 5,300 employees leaving the mortgage business in the third quarter? Can you put any
numbers on that?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No. Mike, that – it's a very fair question. And I think if you look back on any of the 15
quarters that you were referring to, every quarter is going to have a little bit different complexion. And I bet – and as
we look back, I don't bet, I know – if you look back in every one of those quarters, there has been some sort of
headwind that we've had to deal with. And I think that whether it's – we've been through in those quarters the ups and
downs in the mortgage business, we've been through the ups and downs in credit, we've been through the ups and
downs in operating losses and so on and so forth. And I think the important thing to appreciate, again, is it is not just
one driver that's going to get us to continue to be able – that's going to allow us to continue to be able to grow the
company, right?
You saw this quarter, I mean, the fundamentals are pretty exciting, $10.3 billion of point-to-point loan growth, multiple
the industry average. You saw year-over-year non-mortgage fee revenue up 5%; again, multiple of what the underlying
economy is growing. You've seen deposits grow, as John was just talking about. We're not going to turn down deposits,
we want to wave them in. Those are great relationships. Expenses are down from the second quarter to the third
quarter, $150 million. And the improvement in credit is terrific, right? Sure we had a reserve release, but the reserve
release is the result of a lot of good decisions over a long period of time.
So we're just – everything that we've done this quarter is really core to banking, right? It's core to our performance. So
it's not just going to be one thing, it's going to be a combination of everything. If it was just one item, we'd point to it
and we'd move on, but that's what's exciting about Wells Fargo is the diversity of the business model.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: If I can just have a follow-up, one on revenues, one on expenses?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure, yeah.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: As far as you increased securities by $10 billion during the quarter and you bought the
commercial real estate portfolios for another $5 billion. When in the quarter did those go on roughly: the beginning, the
middle, the end?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Most of the securities purchases were done toward the beginning to the middle of the quarter
when rates were higher. And then as rates dropped after the Fed announcement, we slowed down our purchases
because we didn't think the rates were as attractive. In terms of the loan purchases, my recollection is that the
EuroHypo portfolio closed the beginning to the middle of the quarter and then the ING portfolio is closing loan by loan
from about the middle of the quarter to the end.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. So there should be some NII pickup in the fourth quarter from those moves, I would
assume?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, I don't know where NII is going to go. But over time, we certainly want to grow net
interest income, and we're hopeful to grow it in the fourth quarter, and clearly having those two portfolios close will be
beneficial to NII in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then as a follow-up on the efficiency side, I mean, 59.1% is outside your range. I know it's
just one quarter, but that was the fear, right? You get the mortgage slowdown and the efficiency ratio doesn't look as
good. And you made up for it with some other things. But what else can you do outside of mortgage? You've
mentioned the neighborhood stores. How many of those neighborhood stores do you plan to roll out over two or three
years? What's the potential for that? Can you size that, which I don't think you've done?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, good question, Mike. What we do is test and learn, so we are testing that and learning.
There are others on the docket, but we also have an existing 6,200 stores. And if I would just take a step back from that,
when we put the companies together five years ago, we had about 117 million square feet or 118 million square feet.
Today, we're down to about 93 million square feet or 94 million square feet, and we think we have more opportunity to
go.
That's a broad issue around the expenses around distribution. Not all that's distribution, of course; that's the top of the
house. But within the 6,200 banking store distribution, we are upgrading, creating more density, we are looking at
every lease that comes up. So by not only the neighborhood store, which has a big cost advantage – and there'll be
more, we don't know how many yet, but even with the existing 6,200, we can even look at those things.
So every expense, that dollar we spend, gets considered. It gets considered in of itself and how it relates to revenue. But
you're right, we're 59.1%. But I think we also said that none of the benefits, or very few of the benefits, of the mortgage
side – the revenue came out immediately, and yet the expenses of the 5,300 are not out yet. And plus in the top of that,
we added $63 million or $65 million to it for a severance reserve that actually made the expenses go up, if you will. So
we still think those guardrails make sense. Surely, we've touched the high end, but we will continue to work on that.
And also, like we said, each quarter has its own character. Sometimes revenue comes out right away, expenses trail a
bit. But we still feel comfortable with those numbers.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, the 94 million square feet, where could that go? Could it go to 80 million
square feet, 70 million square feet?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: It'll go down. I don't – again, we continue to challenge our thinking. And some things, just to
give you some idea of things that we're thinking about, when we redo stores, we look at density. We look at this whole
idea in some cases of hoteling with – as technology becomes more available and more usable, so – and as our
customers spend more time with self-serving. But we're – but the goal here is not to get square footage gone, the goal
here is to serve customers in an exceedingly well way, have a great place for team members to come to work. And if
we can make all that work and take – and have less square feet, then it's a win-win-win, everybody wins here.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Thanks, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Good morning. I guess, I just wanted to follow-up on some of the credit related questions. I
guess, specifically – I guess, what was it this quarter in particular that allowed for such a dramatic reserve release? And
I guess the reason I ask is, I generally understand credit is continuing to improve but there have been other quarters
where it's – in other words, it's been improvement for a while and in some quarters has been more robust than this
quarter even. So I guess, number one, what was it for this quarter in particular?
And then, I guess, as I look back over really a decade or more, I think, this is by far the lowest absolute level of credit
costs you've had in any given quarter despite you being several times larger than at some points there. So is there any
philosophical difference in the way you guys are thinking about the need to reserve or reserve releases, et cetera?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, no – I'm glad you asked the question. No change in the philosophy in terms of how
we're thinking about reserving. And you're right, I mean, $900 million is an increase over the prior quarter. It's not the
largest reserve release we've had over the last few years, but it is in the last year or so. And I would say it wasn't any
one item, it was just a buildup of a number of items. And when you think about it, a year ago, we had the OCC
guidance that we had to adjust to, and that clearly would have affected the amount of reserve release. Then we had the
hurricane or Superstorm Sandy, and there was concern about what losses might be, and so we needed to make sure that
we were adequately reserved.
And then throughout that same period we've had a continuation of home price appreciation that I think has surprised
everybody. It's amazing how – when it seems like every time one of the surveys come out that the conclusion is, oh, it
can never continue at that rate, and then it's just continued. So those are just some examples of why the reserve releases
have grown so far this year. I can't promise you that they'll continue to grow, but we do feel very comfortable about the
continued improvement in our credit quality.
And the other point that I would make is that, also, it's important to appreciate that the complexion of our loan portfolio
is changing. When you look at our commercial loan portfolio, almost half of the loans that are in that portfolio today
were originated post-crisis, so 2009 and forward. And some were – and I don't have the number exact, and I apologize,
but some were plus or minus 45% of the consumer loan portfolio, was originated post-crisis. So we're seeing the impact
of not only the improvement in credit quality of the pre-crisis portfolio, right? And John talked about the – how our
consumers' and our customers' balance sheets are improving, also the housing price appreciation is impacting that. But
it's also the fact that the new loan portfolio, the post-crisis, the credit quality is just exceptional. So it's a combination of
all of that, it's not just one item.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Okay. All right. Yeah, I definitely appreciate the context around it. Thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. Thank you.

Your final question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks. Hey, John, Tim. I just wanted to ask you a little bit more on the revenue side. I get the
context for NII. We know kind of what's happening on the mortgage front. So can you just flesh out a little bit – I know

you talked about that other areas of the business are in fact growing. But can you give us a thought about, are there any
other areas of the fees where you see potential acceleration or increased growth potential, let's say, help fill in for the
kind of flattish NII and down mortgage trends that we've been seeing of late?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. I mean, I would just go back to looking at the year-over-year improvement on that
non-interest income slide that we walkthrough. And what you saw, and I wouldn't conclude that any one of these items
is going to grow any faster or slower than the others. But what you've seen is a growth in our retail deposit business in
terms of fees. That's reflective of the fact that we've had a growth of primary checking account customers which is very
exciting to see.
You see year-over-year growth in terms of our Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement business on the fee side, both in
terms of the brokerage activity. But maybe even, as importantly, if not more importantly, in terms of the account-based
fees are continuing to grow. Investment banking has been a – has continued to see good growth. Credit card has been
growing and so on and so forth. I mean, I'm leaving some business out, but the fact of the matter is, it's very
broad-based.
So I wouldn't point to any one specific item. As John talked about, we're very excited about credit card, but that's not
the only area of the company that's growing. So I think it's going to be a number of the businesses that will help fill in
any sort of gap over the next few quarters.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: And I guess, just within that, Tim, though, I'm just wondering if there are any businesses, newer
businesses that are kind of hitting their post investment cycle that you've been kind of ramping up, but that could show
a better growth rate? I get all your points that you made, but I'm just wondering if there is – are the things that we
haven't seen as much out of that we could see more out of that are just kind of hitting their right pace of their ramp?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, the last time I checked, John's expectations of all of my colleagues is that he wants to
see growth from all of them.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: You bet. They all have opportunity to grow.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So I wouldn't – no one is...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: No one gets special treatment.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, no one's going to get any special treatment, either positively or negatively. Again,
there's nothing too new and exciting, it's all exciting.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And then last question just on loans again, and this quarter you had the purchases but then
there was a little bit core as well. I guess, a broader question for you, John, there's the government stuff, there was
Syria, there is the Fed, where do think customers are in terms of their desire to invest in the business, especially on the
commercial side? Everyone has been talking about how lame H8 has been over the course of the last couple of months
or so. What does it take to get this – to break through and what are your customers saying about their desires to take
loans and take loans out and build their businesses?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: There is, I would say, guarded optimism. Surely, what happens in Washington is not helpful.
I've said this for some time, I still think it's about confidence, think of the great attributes and advantages this country
has. And we've talked about it before. The best rule of law, even though government looks dysfunctional today
compared to a lot of other places, we wouldn't trade it. We have natural resources. We have an educated workforce. We
have a strong financial services industry, the deepest, most transparent on the planet. Housing is getting better. There
are just so many advantages. That's why we are so bullish long term.
Clearly, in the interim, in the intermediate period, as we go through budgets and at the national level, federal level and
debt ceilings, that's not helpful. But I'm always reminded of our largest shareholder's comments: you don't bet against
the U.S. and we have 97% of our revenues here and we couldn't be more excited about the long term. So I'm optimistic,
but recognize that we still have ways to go.
