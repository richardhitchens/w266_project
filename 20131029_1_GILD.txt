conference call. My name is Erica and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] And as a
reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I will now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patrick O'Brien
Thank you, Erica, and good afternoon, everyone.
We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the third quarter, which is available on our
website, where you can also find detailed slides that support today's call. For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I am
joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Office, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John
Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our Executive Vice
President of Commercial Operations, Kevin Young; and our Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.

Before we begin with our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements,
including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates, financial projections, all of which involve
certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ
materially from these statements.
A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition,
Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.
We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The
GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website.
I would now like to turn the call over to Robin Washington.
Robin L. Washington
Thanks, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us.
Earlier today we reported solid third quarter 2013 results. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 per share compared to $0.50
per share for the same period last year. World-wide product sales exceeded $2.7 billion, up 15% over the same quarter
last year and 2% sequentially, driven largely by the continued uptake of our single-tablet regimens in both the U.S. and
E.U.
Turning to Operating Expenses, year-over-year non-GAAP R&D expenses were up $105 million, which is mainly
attributable to the increased investment in Phase 2 and 3 programs in oncology and Phase 3 programs in HIV.
Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up about $90 million as we continued to expand our infrastructure to support the
anticipated launch of sofosbuvir.
Finally, I would like to update you on our full year 2013 financial guidance, which is summarized on slide 10, in the
earnings presentation available on our corporate website. We are increasing our non-GAAP net product revenue
guidance for full year 2013 to $10.3 billion to $10.4 billion, which represents a $200 million increase from the top end
of our previous guidance range.
Our operating expense and tax rate guidance are also changing as follows. R&D expense guidance will increase to
$1.95 billion to $2 billion. SG&A expense guidance will decrease to $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion. Tax guidance is now
26% to 27%. All other aspects of our guidance for 2013 remain unchanged.
In closing, our year-to-date 2013 financial performance is on track and we look forward to a strong fiscal year close.
I will now hand the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Young
Thank you, Robin.
Breaking down the third quarter results, I would first like to concentrate on the United States. Total U.S. sales for the
quarter were an impressive $1.7 billion, a growth of 20% over the third quarter of 2012. Both antiviral and
cardiopulmonary franchises posted robust year-over-year increases of 19% and 27% respectively.
Looking in more detail at HIV, it is important to first report that there was little effect of either inventory or ADAP
purchase. Inventory for our big three wholesalers increased slightly but stayed around the midpoint of our contractual
range. ADAP Purchasing was solid during the third quarter but lighter than the second quarter of 2013. It is difficult to
predict the picture for the remaining quarters of the federal fiscal year, but we do know now that the base and
emergency funds for 2013 have been fully delivered to each state program.

The third quarter of 2013 marks two years since the launch of Complera and one year since the launch of Stribild. The
adoption of both these new single-tablet regimens continues to be very encouraging. Stribild is now the number one
regimen in naïve HIV patients, the number one regimen in patients who are switched, and more prescriptions have been
written for Stribild during its first year of launch than for any other HIV product since Atripla was introduced in 2006.
The performance of Complera is no less impressive. Complera is the number two regimen in naïve HIV patients and
number two regimen in patients who are switched, and the number two regimen in all HIV-treated patients.
What is especially interesting is to see how the third agent landscape is rapidly changing as a result of the introduction
of Gilead's new STRs. The NNRTI class has significantly reduced in share but is still the leading third agent category.
The integrase inhibitor class has grown sharply and is now the second-largest third agent category.
Finally, the protease Inhibitors have dropped both in share and position, being the smallest of the Third Agents.
Turning to Europe, we were also very pleased with the third quarter year-over-year sales growth of 7% excluding
foreign exchange. The continued strength of Eviplera is reassuring and the very early signs from Stribild are
encouraging. Eviplera sales rose by over 400% year-on-year, driven by the fact that it was the first full quarter for all
Big 5 markets. We are particularly encouraged by the rapid uptake of Eviplera in Spain, a traditionally strong NNRTI
market. In just two quarters since launch, Eviplera is the most prescribed regimen in naïve HIV patients.
Stribild is now commercially available in seven European countries but only two major markets, the U.K. and
Germany. In the U.K., Stribild is the first-ever prescription product to gain pricing approval for the new NHS England
system, and we now look forward to healthy uptake in the coming months. Stribild performance in Germany has got off
to a very fast start with prescriptions running at double the pace of Eviplera at a similar time point in launch. 17% of
naive HIV patients in Germany are already treated with Stribild.
In summary, today's business performed exceptionally well in the third quarter. I'd now like to focus my remaining
comments on our new opportunities in hepatitis C and oncology.
On our quarterly calls, I have kept you abreast of the commercial build outs for HCV in the U.S. and Europe. I am
pleased to report that for both regions, we are now putting the finishing touches in place for sofosbuvir launch. In the
U.S., we have a dedicated sales team of approximately 150 HCV therapeutic specialists who are in territory and going
through the final phases of training.
At the approval of sofosbuvir, this team will discuss our FDA approved label with hepatologists, gastroenterologist and
a proportion of infectious disease specialists. Our HIV team will play no part in the launch of sofosbuvir and will
concentrate solely on supporting our important HIV single tablet regimens.
Wrapped around our HCV sales team will be a complete supporting infrastructure of medical scientists, national
account managers and nurse educators. We feel confident that subject to FDA approval we have the right resources and
the right people to provide strong educational support for sofosbuvir.
Our product distribution model will essentially be similar to that of HIV, yet with a bigger network of specialty
pharmacists. We anticipate that sofosbuvir purchases in December will be largely for opening inventory at the
wholesaler level and that prescribing pull through will only really start in the New Year, especially for the GT-1 patient
requiring pegylated interferon.
In Europe, we anticipate sofosbuvir European Commission approval in the first quarter of 2014. We will then roll out
our launches according to pricing and reimbursement timelines. Like the U.S., by the end of 2013, we will have
finished hiring and training our field sales teams in Germany, the U.K., Austria, Nordics and France. France is an
especially important market to highlight because of its history of HCV infection and subsequent high diagnosis rate.
We have already put in place a so-called French ATU early access program in order to provide sofosbuvir to high-need
pre and post HCV liver transplant patients. Overall, we feel that our commercial launch plans are where they should be
to bring sofosbuvir responsibly to specialists and their patients upon regulatory approval.

Finally, a very brief mention of oncology. We will gear up our sales and marketing efforts for idelalisib commensurate
with projected regulatory timelines. In the U.S., we will build a standalone sales team by mid-2014. Our approach in
Europe will be slightly different where we will look to involve our AmBisome sales team: a team that has already an
excellent reputation with the hospital hematologist.
In closing, as I hope you sense, it is a very busy, yet exciting time at Gilead as we roll out the next stages of
commercial growth.
I will now turn the call over to Norbert.
Norbert W. Bischofberger
Thank you, Kevin.
I am pleased with the rapid progress across all our R&D programs and the high level of productivity. A large number of
development programs are now being advanced from IND through Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical development. First, an
update on oncology.
In September, an NDA was submitted to FDA for idelalisib for the treatment of doubly-refractory iNHL. This
application was supported by data from study 101-09, a single arm open label Phase 2 study of 125 patients who were
refractory to both rituximab and alkylating agent containing chemotherapy.
In this study, idelalisib achieved an overall response rate of 54% with a median duration of response of 11.9 months.
The most common adverse events were diarrhea, transaminase elevations and neutropenia. The final analysis of this
study will be presented at an upcoming conference.
In October, Study 116 of idelalisib was stopped early following a recommendation by an Independent Data and Safety
Monitoring Board. Study 116 is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in patients with previously treated
recurrent CLL who require treatment but were not fit to receive cytotoxic therapy based on clinically important
co-morbidities. 80% of the patients were greater than 65 years of age and 44% had the 17p deletion or TP53 mutation.
220 patients were randomized one-to-one to rituximab plus idelalisib versus rituximab plus placebo.
After reviewing data from a pre-defined interim analysis, an independent data and safety monitoring board
recommended stopping the study early due to overwhelming evidence of efficacy together with appropriate
considerations of safety. Data from Study 116 will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific conference
also.
The data from this interim analysis of Study 116 in CLL, together with the data from Study 101-09 in iNHL is included
in the European Marketing Authorization application which was filed just yesterday. In the U.S., we have initiated
discussions with FDA regarding a regulatory filing in CLL either as a separate NDA or as a submission to the existing
NDA. An expanded access program of idelalisib for patients with recurrent CLL requiring treatment but who are not fit
for chemotherapy is planned. In addition, four Phase 3 studies in relapsed refractory iNHL and CLL patients are
currently enrolling.
The Phase 3 program evaluating momelotinib, our JAK1/2 inhibitor in myelofibrosis will be initiated in the fourth
quarter of 2013. We are planning two randomized studies for momelotinib for registration. The first is an active control
head-to-head study versus ruxolitinib in newly diagnosed patients requiring therapy. The second study is in patients
who have failed ruxolitinib therapy because of its bone marrow suppression effects and will compare momelotinib with
best available therapy. This study will start in the first quarter of 2014.
In addition to the rapid progress with idelalisib, Phase 2 studies are underway for GS-9820, a backup PI3K delta
inhibitor, and for GS-9973, our Syk inhibitor, both alone and in combination with idelalisib in various b-cell
malignancies. A Phase 2 study of simtuzamab in pancreatic cancer is fully enrolled, and studies in colorectal cancer and
myelofibrosis are continuing to enroll. GS-5745, an anti-MMP9 antibody, is under evaluation in Phase 1/2 studies in
pancreatic and gastric cancers. We are looking forward to sharing the emerging data of our oncology studies as they

become available.
Now turning to HIV, in October Tybost, which is also known as cobicistat, received European Commission approval,
and elvitegravir received a positive CHMP opinion, and we expect European Commission approval by the end of this
year. In the U.S., a complete response letter was issued by FDA on cobicistat and elvitegravir in April, and the
re-submission is planned for the first half of 2014.
The two Phase 3 studies evaluating TAF, Gilead's novel prodrug tenofovir, are expected to be fully enrolled this month.
These studies are identical in design, evaluating Stribild to a single-tablet regimen of elvitegravir, COBI, FTC and
TAF, abbreviated as E/C/F/TAF, in over 800 patients in each study in treatment naive HIV-infected patients. The
primary endpoint in this study is at 48-weeks and we would expect that data to be available in the fourth quarter of
2014.
E/C/F/TAF will also be evaluated in two additional Phase 3 studies, in Study 117 in patients who are failing on their
current regimen and who have not previously been treated with an integrase inhibitor, and then Study 119 in fully
suppressed patients who are taking a multi-tablet BID regimen and who have previously failed at PI or an NNRTI
regimen. Both of these studies are currently enrolling.
Along with E/C/F/TAF we plan to also submit a marketing authorization application for F/TAF, which will be
supported by a single bioequivalence study. The two Phase 3 studies evaluating TAF as a single agent for the treatment
of chronic hepatitis B infection, one in e-antigen positive, the other one e-antigen negative patients are currently
enrolling.
And finally, turning to HCV, as all of you are aware, we had a successful FDA Advisory Committee Meeting last
week. The panel voted unanimously in favor of approval of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for the treatment of genotype two
and three hepatitis C infected patients and for approval of a 12-week course of sofosbuvir pegylated interferon ribavirin
for the treatment of genotype one and four hepatitis C infected patients.
In addition, the majority of panel members were in favor of broadening the indication to include genotype 1 treatment
experienced patients in the label. And they also backed the use of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in the pre-transplant setting
for patients with HCC. At the Advisory Committee meeting new data were presented from the VALENCE study,
which indicated that both treatment naïve and treatment experienced genotype three hepatitis C infected patients with
sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24-weeks resulted in SVR rates of 84%.
We are naturally excited about bringing sofosbuvir to the market and we feel, like some panel members commented,
that this is a historic moment, for which every employee at Gilead is proud. We look forward to working with FDA to
complete the review of the sofosbuvir NDA and ultimately launch the product.
Meanwhile, the clinical development program of the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir fixed-dose combination is also proceeding
rapidly. Three Phase 3 studies: ION-1, ION-2 and ION-3 explore the utility of the fixed-dose combination of both
treatments naïve and treatment experienced genotype one, hepatitis C infected patients with and without ribavirin and
for treatment durations of 8-, 12- and 24-weeks. We anticipate having data from these Phase 3 studies available towards
the end of this year and into early next year and we are on track for NDA MAA filings in the second quarter of 2014.
The development of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin for genotype two infected patients in Japan is
progressing. The single arm Phase 3 study with 12-weeks treatment duration was fully enrolled in September and we're
on track to submit the marketing application in Japan towards the middle of 2014. This is a significant opportunity as
genotype two infected patients in Japan constitute over 25% of the total and sofosbuvir and ribavirin will be the first all
oral, interferon-free option for these patients.
In addition, the Phase 3 program of the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with and without ribavirin in
genotype one hepatitis C infected patients was initiated in September of 2013 and we anticipate this study to be fully
enrolled by the end of this year.
This two arm study in 300 genotype one infected both treatment naïve and treatment experienced patients randomized
to a 12-week course of the fixed-dose combination with and without ribavirin.

Finally, the potentially pan-genotypic interferon and ribavirin free regimen, a combination of sofosbuvir and the
pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor GS-5816 is advancing through Phase 2 development. Two studies in treatment naïve and
treatment experienced patients in various genotypes are fully enrolled and depending on emerging data, we should be in
a position to initiate Phase 3 studies in the second half of 2014.
More information on our programs will be presented at the annual AASLD meeting, which will commence this week in
Washington, D.C. Over 50 abstracts were submitted on Gilead's various liver disease programs and importantly, new
data will be presented on the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir ribavirin in HIV co-infected patients and in the post-liver
transplant setting.
In summary, very rapid progress is being made across all our therapeutic areas in all our programs. Our pipeline
provides us with numerous opportunities for continued growth, both short-term and longer-term.
We want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and dedication.
So with that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Meacham>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just on Hep C, looking at your market research, you
guys have obviously done a lot of work ahead of the sofosbuvir launch. So I wanted to know, on the epidemiology
slide, what would you say are the biggest gating factors to convert patients from diagnosed to the treated bucket?
And then just a related question, when you think about the filing of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir, what's the current
thinking on which of the ION studies will go into that filing? I know time is of the essence here. Thanks, guys.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hi, Geoff. It's Kevin. Thanks for the question. The one bucket that we're still working up, and I
think we're getting close but we're still sort of road testing is what we term as patients under treated care, so those are
patients who are diagnosed but are under the management of say, a hepatalogist, a gastroenterologist, or an infectious
disease specialist. That bucket tends to move around a bit, a lot more than would do a typical bucket of patients in HIV,
because patients are treated and obviously are cured. Some patients are treated and not cured and stay with their
specialist, and some are treated and drift, if you like, back into that 1.7 of diagnosed but leave the specialists. So one of
the reasons that we want to double-check that number and wait a little while until we have a few more quarters is just to
get that as correct as we can.
We do think there is a good number of patients that are currently under care that we can access fairly quickly with the
sales force that we've put in place at the launch of sofosbuvir. Some of those are treatment-experienced and they're
probably the most obvious bucket of patients, and it was nice to see the remarks at the FDA Advisory Panel around the
possibility of getting a label for the treatment-experienced. And some of them are treatment naïve. So we do think, first
and foremost, our focus will be with the specialist treater for the patients that they currently have in their practices that
they would be recalling to go on sofosbuvir.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah, Geoff, to answer the other question, all three studies will go in the NDA. We
feel they're all important. As you may remember, ION-1 is treatment naïve, ION-2 is treatment-experienced, and ION-3
explores an eight-week course of therapy both with and without ribavirin.
We are fairly convinced that we will be able to repeat the Phase 2 results, which would mean that even the eight-weeks
duration will give you high response rates, and that will be important information to have in the label. The rate-limiting
study, by the way, to remind you, is the 24-week arms of ION-1, and that will become available sometime early in
2014 and that determines the path to the NDA.

<Q - Geoffrey C. Meacham>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please proceed.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey. Thanks a lot, guys. First I'd just like to say congratulations to Kevin on just the
phenomenal launch of the next-generation HIV drugs. Some of those slides are really amazing, so good job. I know
everyone is interested in hep C, but pretty cool stuff.
I was just wondering on the slide you guys have that shows the 1.7 million patients in the U.S. that are diagnosed,
excuse me, with hep C, if you could let us know perhaps how many of those right now, you estimate are incarcerated
and how many are in the VA? And then when you give guidance next year, will the sales guidance include hep C when
you give that in January? Thank you.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Mark. Well, first of all, that was very decent of you to thank everybody here for our uptake
of single-tablets in HIV. I'm lucky to work with some great people, so they're doing a fine job and got – we've got some
nice data behind those products.
In terms of the number of patients or people, should I say, because I think it's more people with HCV, it's quoted that
about 4% of the VA population, that's about 225,000 people, veterans, have hepatitis C. And I would say, Mark, that
that's probably a higher priority for us, the VA population, than corrections. We have really good relationships with the
VA and we feel that that – that their model of accessing patients at the launch of sofosbuvir as a single agent is
probably easier and more straightforward than it is in the correctional setting.
In the correctional setting, I honestly don't know off the top of my head the total number of people that go through the
correctional setting, but the CDC have quoted that 35% of the prison population, up to 35%, has hepatitis C. We will be
addressing the correctional setting. As you know, we do have a team for HIV today that address that population. But I
have to say, I do think it will be the interferon-free regimen that will do better in the correctional setting. I don't think
interferon has ever done particularly well in the correctional setting because of the obvious side effects, so I think it's
going to be sofosbuvir/ledipasvir that will be a better regimen for corrections.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Hi Mark. This is Robin to answer your second question. I mean, it's hard at this point in
time to give guidance about our guidance. We're hard at work on preparing for a successful launch so, but I can say that
we're undecided yet relative to what granularity we give around guidance by products, particularly new product
launches at this point.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: I understand that about 245...
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: ...hi, okay. Kevin, just to follow up on the HCV question, the – could you talk us to –
clearly what everyone's signaled is potentially huge demand for particularly the ribavirin-sofosbuvir-based regimen but
also obviously single-tablet regimens later. What are you hearing from payers both in the U.S. and outside the U.S.
about what – how they're going to triage patients, and what, if any, restrictions might be imposed? Is it going to be
enough to just show up to a physician in France and say I've got HCV, treat me, or to a physician in the U.S. and say I'd
like treatment, or are they going to be – is there going to be some triaging of patients depending upon fibrosis or
anything else? That would be helpful for us to understand. Thanks.

<A - Kevin Young>: Thank you for the question, Geoff. That's a really broad question, let me try and go through a
sequence here.
Let me deal with the U.S. first. We have had a lot of discussion with U.S. payers. They certainly have HCV on their
radar but I'm encouraged from our conversations that they will reimburse well for sofosbuvir, and of course the broader
the label, the better. Again, I was encouraged with the tone of the Advisory Committee that we could come out after
our further discussions with a good broad label and that would help us with U.S. payers.
There will always be a prior authorization that a patient has to go through and the physician and the office have to go
through before starting an HCV treatment, but that generally is a check that the drug is being used on label so we think
that will be a fairly straightforward and most of the hepatalogists and gastroenterologists who currently prescribe in
HCV are used to that step. So I think we are encouraged that we will have very good coverage in the United States.
In Europe, of course, it is a country-by-country pricing and reimbursement process. It depends on the country. The
earlier markets are typically the U.K. and Germany, the later markets are the Southern European markets. We do think
that in certain categories, and I really highlight the liver transplant area, that we may get some exceptional coverage
between the European Commission approval and the normal timelines of pricing and reimbursement and that's just
because of the absolute unmet need.
We also hope that the normal pricing and reimbursement process will go a little bit quicker for a drug as innovative as
sofosbuvir. Basically, early next year we will be submitting our dossiers to bodies like NICE, AMNOG, the
Transparency Committee in France. So we are all geared up and we think we have some good data that really shows
exceptional cost benefit for sofosbuvir. So, a long answer, but I hope that gives you some sort of color.

Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Yeah, I guess I also had a question for Kevin, but one for Norbert, as well. For genotype
two and three patients in the U.S., maybe you can just give us a little bit more sense? A lot of genotype one patients
will wait for the fixed oral dosage pill but genotype two and three there's less visibility, perhaps that maybe they would
be less inclined to wait? So I just wanted to get your thoughts on how to think about that population for 2014?
And then, Norbert, on 5816, do you actually have some on-treatment or SVR results now? And I just wanted to take
your temperature on that program? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hi, Rachel. It's Kevin. We do think that the two and three's will be taken up pretty quickly. If you
look at the table in our Slide 28, you've got about 20% of the U.S. population of HCV population is genotype two and
three. So we think that's the most obvious patient category because you haven't got interferon.
I think in terms of how a treating physician will move through those two and three patients, of course it will be the ones
with advanced liver disease or perhaps that have even failed previously on an interferon-based therapy. But it is, I
think, the obvious group of patients to be getting on and treating right from launch.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Rachel, with regards to clinical data, we do have some emerging data so that the
toughest test for 5816 is genotype three. That's simply based on virology data, we do have some emerging data in the
treatment naïve genotype three population that looks promising, but what we have to wait for, and that's the rate
limiting is genotype three treatment experienced. We will get those data sometime in the February, March timeframe of
next year. So only then would we really make the decision to go into a more advanced Phase 3 program if we hit the
genotype three treatment experienced population.

Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Yeah, hi. And I've got to tell you also really congratulations. If you look at where you were
two years ago and where you are now, I mean it's absolutely incredible. So congrats on a really a terrific job, on really
everything, it's hep C, HIV and oncology.
So I have two questions and both of them are obviously, as you can imagine, hep C. The first one, just one of the things
you guys asked for a sofosbuvir label that is very broad, that covers the treatment of hepatitis C with other oral – other
drugs broadly and I just wanted to get your sense as to it looks like FDA was very supportive overall, but they didn't
really necessarily comment on that. They sort of made some remarks. What are your thoughts on the ability to get that
label?
And then secondly, in 5816 you're actually doing an eight-week arm now for genotype three. So it sounds like you guys
have a lot of confidence in genotype three so I'm just trying to get a sense, what do you know on ledipasvir and
sofosbuvir? It sounds like you already know something about 5816 but what do you know about ledipasvir and
sofosbuvir for eight-weeks? Thank you.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Well, Yaron, the first question you asked about the chance that we get that broad
label that was described in the Antiviral Advisory Committee Meeting at the beginning. And I'm not sure whether you
listened to the day before to the simeprevir deliberations. Jeff Murray made a comment along the lines they said they
don't want to do that right now. They have been surprised in the past about different regimens having different response
rates. They would like to get some more experience to figure out which specific combination works and which ones
should you rather stay away from.
So they indicated they would not favor at this point to give us a broad indication to just say with other agents. And
again, this all has to still be negotiated. We have not had a really in-depth conversation with the FDA about this. That
will happen now that the Advisory Committee meeting is over.
And the other question you asked so what we do know about 5816 is that it works in genotype three treatment naïve
patients. As I said, we need the genotype three treatment experienced and then as you very astutely observed we also
initiated recently a study to look at eight-weeks of therapy and again it would be the same thought process if we initiate
the Phase 3 program we might actually do the Phase 3 program eight-weeks treatment in genotype in all genotypes
treatment naïve and maybe 12-weeks of treatment in treatment experienced. But again it all depends on how the Phase
2 data emerges. But at least we will be in a position next year to make an informed and intelligent decision as to what
the Phase 3 program is going to look like based on Phase 2 data.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Okay. Thanks for taking my question and my congrats as well on all the progress and on
the positive panel. So it sounds like 12-weeks for genotypes one and two and 24-weeks for genotype three were the
durations that the panelists and the FDA are leaning towards based on all the data. Now that that's a little bit more
concrete, I'm just wondering how does that shape your pricing strategy in terms of balancing the three genotypes next
year and also anticipating the all oral combo coming on in 2015? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Brian. It's Kevin. Thanks again for your nice words. We're very close now, Brian. It's only
six weeks to PDUFA date, so not long to wait until we set our price at launch. So I can't go into really great detail
today.
The one comment I would make is that there's only 9% of the U.S. population – HCV population that are GT three. So
whilst those patients look like they're going to be given a label of 24-weeks and you could say well, is that going to

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Great. Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats to John and Bill and the rest of
the team on the successful FDA panel. Kevin, these data points on Hep C are great. I guess I just wanted to ask a little
bit more – if you could just speak a little bit more about the methodology here. Is it fair to say that you wouldn't have
put these numbers out if there wasn't a fairly high conviction in these estimates?
And then just drilling down on that a little bit more, do you have a sense of what the proportion is among the diagnosed
who have evidence of advanced liver disease? It seems to me that those would be the more urgent need to treat patients
that might be tackled more in the near term than long-term. Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Yeah, just to give you a little bit of background of how we're trying to develop this, Matt. We're
going down a road of the patient database like we've done with Synovate. Synovate became Ipsos. Ipsos is the people
that we are working with once again. It takes a long time to develop robust samples.
I have to tell you that whilst we are getting more confident with hepatitis C, the sampling is far lower both in terms of
the physician universe as well as the number of charts that we get for HIV. We have 10 years of developing that
database. We're really only in sort of year one of getting this off the ground at Gilead. So I think we're getting more
confident. As I said earlier, one of the reasons that we're still not sharing fully that bucket that sits with the specialists
or the patients that are diagnosed that sit with specialist treaters, is that we just want one or two more quarters to make
sure that it is reproducible. But I think we're getting more comfortable.
In terms of treatment experienced, I think there is something in the range of 80,000 to 100,000 patients that are
treatment-experienced today, and they sit between that 1.7 million – sit within the 1.7 million diagnosed, but somewhat
lower number – that they're sort of at the lower end of the spectrum. About 80,000 are probably in and around the
specialist office. So that's our directional sense today.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey, thanks. Congrats as well. A question on Slide 31, I thought that was quite interesting with
your breakout of the distribution channels. Do you have any sense of the size, relative size of the buckets there,
particularly VA and prisons, and how price-sensitive those buckets may be? Do you have to get contracts there? How
does that really work, and then the relative size amongst those four? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hi, Michael. It's Kevin. Great question. By far the majority of sofosbuvir will go through the first
two blocks there. Specialty Pharmacy play an important role and have done since the launch of the PIs in supporting
the hepatalogist and the gastroenterologist. So the majority will go through Specialty Pharmacy and through other retail
chains like the large retailers: Walgreens, CVS. So by far they are bigger. Much smaller will be VA and prisons.
Typically with someone like the VA, we do go through a contracting process for supply. We feel that we've got a very,
very strong value proposition with sofosbuvir, and we'd be looking to have a very constructive conversation once we
bring it for listing on their national formularies. So we think we can maintain close to our retail pricing that will be in

the first two buckets. The one obvious thing that's different with sofosbuvir than HIV, is obviously that we don't have
the large ADAP bookings that has lower pricing that we have in the HIV world. So our expectation is that very little if
any will move through the ADAP channel for hepatitis C.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Do you think VA is like 5% or 10% or bigger than that?
<A - Kevin Young>: I think it's in that ballpark, the one you quoted there, 5% to 10%. It's quite small.

Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first, just a follow-up. So for ION-3
eight-weeks, will you have that data or like, do you have it in-house, and will you have that data before you launch so
you know how to price the drug? And how are you thinking about releasing it? Would you release it with the full
ION-3 data set? And then just to clarify on 5816, so you talked about how you might think about developing it for
genotype 3 as maybe shortening duration of therapy for these other patients, but how do you view it for genotype 1? Is
it more of a lifecycle management tool with better safety without riba? How are you thinking about it?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: First of all, Robyn, you asked about availability of data from ION-3. We don't have
those data now but as soon as we will have the SVR 12, so the regulatory endpoint, we intend to do a press release on
that, that will just give you the top line results. That data will go into the NDA filing unless it's completely negative,
which I would find hard to believe because we have done the Phase 2 study, as you know.
And then the second question, you asked how are we viewing 5816. It really I think everything else it's the profile holds
up with continued clinical development then in Phase 3 the fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and 5816 would
really replace the fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir. It would be the pan-genotypic interferon free,
ribavirin free, single pill for everybody where you don't have to worry about which genotype and what history and what
resistance mutation we have. That's how we are looking at the 5816/sofosbuvir fixed dose combination.
And by the way that's also the reason why we're testing it specifically in the fairly large Phase 3 study in genotype three
treatment experienced patients. We have absolutely no concerns that it works on genotype one. That's a given but the
question we have is genotype three treatment experienced. If it passes that test, then I think we have a pan-genotypic
interferon ribavirin free maybe eight-weeks but certainly 12-weeks treatment duration regimen for everybody.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Great. Thanks. And just to clarify, the question about ION was really more about
eight-weeks. Do you have eight-weeks in house and will you have the eight-week data before you launch the product?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: No. So, Robyn, the way we do this operationally we don't look at – we don't
internally look at data as they become available. Once everybody has – the last patient, last visit which is obviously the
12-week duration visit the 93 that's the time when we actually would clean up the database, lock it and then unblind it.
That has not happened yet.
<A - John F. Milligan>: Hey, Robyn. It's John Milligan. I think the confusion here is what you mean by the product.
So I assume you mean, will we have the eight-week data in-house before we launch sofosbuvir. And the answer...
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Correct.
<A - John F. Milligan>: ...is we will not, so we're going to be extrapolating from the Phase 2 data as a way to gauge
what the pricing will be as we launch sofosbuvir assuming that we will have a similar outcome from those Phase 2.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Got it, great. That's very clear. Thank you so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Co. Please proceed.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. One, Norbert, for you. We obviously are going to see the
ION 1, 2 and 3 data over the next several months. Our sense of expectations for those data are that they are going to
largely replicate what we saw in Phase 2. So in treatment naïve patients SVR rates of at least 90% – possibly
approaching 100% and in treatment experienced patients SVR rates probably 80% or higher. Do those expectations jive
with what you yourself are expecting or is there anything about the treatment designs – the trial designs here that the
patient populations that we should keep in mind as we await these data sets to modulate what SVR rates we should
anticipate?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: So you're exactly right. That is our internal expectation that we will replicate the
Phase 2 data. There's no reason to believe why we wouldn't. It's just larger patient numbers. You always lose a few
more if you have more sites than maybe a few were lost to follow-up but I'm very convinced we'll see 90% or higher
response rates. And what I said before – the eight-week study in LONESTAR, even though the numbers were not large
and about 25 per arm, what they absolutely do is they validate and give you a lot of confidence in the 12-week results.
That's why we are very confident that we saw 95% or 100% response rates with eight-weeks of treatment in Phase 2.
That's why I'm confident we'll see 95% to 100% response rate in Phase 3 with 12-weeks treatment duration.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Okay. And then just one last question on treatment duration. I believe at AASLD there's going
to be a study out of, I think it's the NIH, that's looking at a six-week regimen where the data were intriguing. Can you
talk about the data and how you'd put that in context when you look towards moving even beyond the next generation
of regimens? Is this something that you will begin to push the duration down to six-weeks?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: So, Brian, this is our thinking. So as you know, we have continuously reduced
treatment duration. We were actually surprised ourselves, it went from 24-weeks to 12-weeks to 8-weeks and there was
a presentation at AASLD that talks about six-weeks. And what that presentation would indicate that six-weeks with two
drugs is not enough. So we're now asking the next question, if you add a third drug to a six-week sofosbuvir/ledipasvir,
will the response rates again go up to 90% to 100%? That's going to be the experiment that you will hear about at the
AASLD. And if that is indeed the case, then we have to make a decision internally if that's something we want to
pursue because you always have to challenge another drug. It's always more complicated. There's always more drug
interactions. There may be more safety issues and what you gain is maybe two weeks of treatment duration.
Maybe Kevin wants to comment on it too?
<A - Kevin Young>: Yeah, Phil, I'd say, just to chip in with a commercial angle here. I think if you move from three
months to two months, that's clearly a step change and an advantage. I think going from eight weeks to six weeks
doesn't really give you that much more and two months, if it turns out that way, is a very nice set sort of regimen to
deliver to a patient. I don't think carving off an extra two weeks is that big a differentiator when it comes to the
commercial profile for the products.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: But, Brian, having that said, it's something we're still debating internally so we
haven't really come to a final conclusion yet.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.

just in terms of the ION-2 data set, my understanding is this is open label? I'm just wondering, are you guys blinded to

And also would you release the 12-week data when it's in hand or would you wait for the full and 12 and 24-weeks?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah, so Brian, we actually internally do not look at emerging data. We wait for
the whole study to be done because what you have to be really careful with Phase 3 and what we would never do is by
looking at the data, you could always be accused or viewed as influencing the ongoing conduct of the study. And if you
were to make available SVR four data from the 12-week arm, that would undoubtedly influence the 24-week arms of
the studies and you don't want to do that. So we internally wait for the whole study to be done. The last patient at the
last visit and then we look at the data.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Gotcha. And then just really quick on oncology, I noticed you have GS-9820, a next gen
delta PI3 kinase inhibitor. I was just wondering if you could kind of highlight the differentiation between idelalisib and
9820 in terms of where you think this might be a better version of that? I know some of the competition are developing
a PI3K delta inhibitor, talk about potentially circumventing the DLTs, in particular liver tox. Do you think that's a
target?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah, Brian, really good question. That's exactly it. We're looking at 9820 as
something that has the same efficacy characteristics as idelalisib without the liver toxicity because liver toxicity, we
believe, is compound specific. It is not mechanism or anything else related and so by making different analogs we are
convinced we can come up with PI3K delta inhibitor that don't have DLT [indiscernible] (57:27) elevation and early
clinical data, we haven't dosed enough patients yet, would indicate just that. We have to this date not seen transaminase
elevations with 9820.

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Hi. Thanks very much. Regarding the liver transplant opportunity, do you see sofosbuvir used
in pre-transplant HCV patients outside HCC and in post-transplant patients?
And then related, Kevin mentioned there might be exceptional coverage in the E.U. for liver transplant prior to
reimbursement decision? Can you explain how that works?
<A - Kevin Young>: Hi, Howard. Thanks for the question. I think if your question for the U.S. is, do we have
expectation of extensive uptake for a liver transplant patient with HCV who is on the wait list, and we think there are
probably in the U.S. between 5,000 and 6,000 patients on the wait list for a transplant. We think yes, we think those
patients are very obvious patients to be treated ideally to clear their HCV pre the transplants. So it will be subject to
approval, and in our label it will be an obvious patient group for us. We know the specialist hepatalogist who supports
the transplant program. We know a lot of the transplant surgeons as well, so we would direct some very specialist
educational efforts to this group of patients.
Mentioning these schemes that are available in Europe, I did mention a good example in my script, and that's called the
French ATU. Translated, that really means temporary authorization for use. It's something that is granted by the French
regulatory authorities. I think it's a very novel thing where they will cover and allow the prescribing of a
pharmaceutical pre-European approval where there is profound unmet need, and so we have started to supply
sofosbuvir under that designation in France. That was about – we started about a week ago and that's for the pre- and
post-liver transplant setting, so that's a good example.
It varies from country to country but there are schemes, not quite as extensive as the French ATU, but there are special
categories that allow for getting the drug out there, typically after the European Commission approval but before
pricing and reimbursement, where normally for a pharmaceutical there would be no uptake at all.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Howard, I would like to add, as you saw at the Advisory Committee meeting, that
the FDA is currently thinking of limiting the indication to the actual population studied, which was HCC patients that

fit the Milan criteria. But you might also look at the AASLD abstract. We have a very exciting presentation on
post-liver transplant where we actually saw fairly respectable SVR rates with sofosbuvir/ribavirin.
So whatever label we end up with, we will soon after approval file an sNDA and get those additional data on the label
and broaden the indication. By the way, HCC patients that are on the transplant list that fit these criteria are about one
in five of the transplants, so it's not insignificant but it could be larger.

Your next question comes from the line of Nick Abbott with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Nick Abbott>: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I'd like to follow-up on the theme of pricing
and genotype with a two part question. First, can you tell me what the breakdown of genotype is with HCC, and
secondly, knowing that fibrosis and HCC is higher for genotype 3 than other genotypes, in your data genotype 3
prevalence in EU Big 5, for the big five, is 20% to 40%. Do you have pharmaco-economic dossiers for EU detail HCC
risk per genotype, which presumably helps you justify a higher price for genotype 3 given the longer duration? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: So, Nick, you're right, we've got some interesting country effects in Europe where a lot more are
genotype 3. A good example is the U.K. where some of the populations that were immigrant populations, either
first-generation or second-generation, but large populations in and around London, have genotype 3. We've done
pharmaco-economic analysis on all our patient populations, both the naïve setting and the advanced sclerotic setting, so
they will be all part of the dossiers that we will be supplying to the pricing and reimbursement bodies, particularly
NICE and AMNOG/IQWIG in Germany.
So we feel that we've, just like Norbert's done in treating a broad array of HCV populations, we felt it necessary to do
the same from a pharmaco-economic point of view. So hopefully supporting a good broad array of patients.
Again, I would just say, Nick, we are quite close to the launch of the product here and hopefully first quarter in Europe
so I'd just hold back on further comment on pricing.

We have time for one more question. Your question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please
proceed.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in here. Just two from me. I was just wondering in terms of the
diagnosis rate – the peak diagnosis rate that we might think of in the U.S. I was wondering if France and Japan maybe
are suitable proxies as we look at some of the data you guys have?
And then Robin, I was wondering on capital allocation if you can give us any update in terms of what you're thinking
now that you brought your leverage ratio down and we're approaching the end of the year? Thanks a lot.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hi, Terrence. It's Kevin. Great question. I don't think that the U.S. will get to the level of France
or the really high level of Japan. I certainly think it would take quite some years to get there. I think what really
triggered the situation first and foremost in Japan and then fairly similarly in France was, of course, there was a lot of
publicity, there was a lot of, I would say – go as far as saying scandal around the infection of individuals through blood
transfusions. So I think it became very political and it forced governments to go on the front foot in terms of proactive
measures in terms of screening of patients. So that's why you see the very, very high levels in Japan and above 50%
actually in France. So they were so politicized, they were so high-profile – the population, it was in newspapers, on
television and I think that drove that very high diagnosis rate. We feel we certainly can go higher in the U.S. I'm not
sure whether it will ever get to the level certainly of Japan.

<A - Robin L. Washington>: And, Terrence, to your second question, overall our capital framework remains the
same. We're focused on ensuring we have the financial flexibility to invest in the business, make the necessary M&A
decisions and return value to shareholders. As you can see we did start our share repurchases back this quarter and we
expect that to continue to accelerate into Q4 and beyond in 2014.
