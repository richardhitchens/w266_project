MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Cheryl, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome
everyone to Avon's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the conference over to Amy Chasen, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. Ms. Chasen, you may
begin your conference.
Amy Low Chasen
Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Avon's fourth quarter and full-year results. With me today on the
call are Sheri McCoy, Avon's CEO; and Kimberly Ross, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Sheri will provide a
perspective on 2013 and then Kimberly will take you through our results. Then we will have our usual Q&A session.
With that, I refer you to the cautionary statement in today's earnings release as well as to our non-GAAP reconciliation,
which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual, on the call, we will focus on these
adjusted non-GAAP financial measures.
I'll now hand the call over to Sheri.
Sheri McCoy
Thanks Amy. Good morning. As I said in our press release, I'm pleased that we're making headway toward our
financial goals and Avon's return to profitable growth. We still face considerable challenges. In some cases, driving

improvement has been more challenging and has taken longer than I had anticipated. That being said, we continue to
make progress toward building a better, simpler and more stable business.
Before we get started, I want to acknowledge the results we released this morning reflect a continued deterioration of
the North American business. I know this is an area of concern for you, as it is for us. Reversing this decline and taking
that drag off of our overall performance is at the top of my agenda. Next week at CAGNY Pablo Munoz, Head of
Avon's North America business, will take you through our plans for stabilizing the U.S. market in 2014.
I can assure you that it's not business as usual, and that we're taking the necessary actions to get this business back on
solid footing. This morning I'm going to take a few minutes to share my perspective on 2013, where we saw progress
and where we continue to confront challenges. Then Kimberly will review the financial results and then we'll open the
line for Q&A.
Looking back at 2013, we certainly had some ups and downs. We went into the year with a solid first half and then
experienced a decline in the second half, driven by both executions and macroeconomic factors. Despite the tough back
half of the year and a top line deceleration, I'm pleased to say that we finished in line with what we told you to expect
for 2013. We had modest improvement in our financial performance, we did well on operating margin and cash;
however, we need to do a better job at driving top line growth. We improved our capital structure, we made headway
on our cost manager work, and this is an area we'll continue to focus on in 2014. We also optimized our geographic
portfolio by exiting underperforming markets, and in 2014, we will continue this work. We will also be staying close to
the economic trends and currency volatility we see in some of our emerging markets. Emerging markets remain a
long-term opportunity for Avon, and play a significant role in our strategy to return to profitable growth. What we
know from our past experience is that in times of instability or downward economic pressure, there are some specific
levers we need to pull around representative recruitment and price mix to limit the negative impact.
In 2013, we also made progress in our category strategies, although there is more work to be done, particularly in skin
care. And we strengthened the management team. I feel good about my executive team which is complete now that
Nilesh Patel has joined us to lead Avon Asia Pacific. We also strengthened the management teams in several of our key
markets.
In 2014, we'll continue to focus on building our bench strength in our key markets as well as filling critical capability
gaps, particularly in commercial marketing and field management. When I joined Avon, I committed to making the
tough call to address underlying issues that plagued the company for years.
This is crucial to ensuring that we have a sustainable future. In 2013, we tackled some of those tough issues. For
instance, we divested Silpada, altered SMT rollouts, successfully refinanced our debt and made progress on litigation
matters. None of these issues are easy and each of them required attention from management. But we are working to
put them behind us now, leaving Avon in better shape to move into the future.
Let me provide some perspective on two of these areas: SMT and FCPA. As you saw in our press release, we took a
charge related to the termination of our service model transformation rollout. As most of you know, SMT was a project
that began in 2009 and was intended to update our older management system and improve how our representatives do
business with Avon.
We launched SMT pilot in Canada last year and found that the Canadian implementation was very disruptive and
resulted in a severe decline in both revenue and active representatives. It was clear that SMT came with a sizeable price
tag, but without a clear return on investment and that we had better alternatives for improving how our representatives
do business with Avon. All things considered, ending the project was the right thing to do for Avon. We are winding
down the SMT team and are terminating or renegotiating related vendor payments.
Moving forward, we will take a focused and more measured approach to upgrading our order management systems,
one that delivers a clear return on investment and importantly, does not disrupt the business. While we are shifting
gears on our approach to order management systems, we're continuing to work as planned on other aspects of our IT
agenda and will continue to make progress on updating our infrastructure.

Turning now to FCPA. As you saw in our press release this morning, we've continued our discussions with the SEC
and DoJ, and we've made significant progress. Based on the status of our recent discussions, we believe that a
reasonable range for settlement with both agencies would be $89 million to $132 million. Our discussions with the
government are ongoing and differences remain. But the team is working hard in an effort to bring these mattes to a
close.
I'm going to hand it over to Kimberly now for her review of our fourth quarter and full-year results. Kimberly?
Kimberly A. Ross
Thank you, Sheri. Before jumping into Q4 results, I just wanted to say a brief word about 2013. Revenue declined 1%
in constant dollars, which was below our expectations coming into the year. As I will discuss, we continue to have
some challenges driving sustainable sales growth. However, at the same time, we continue to make progress in the area
of cost savings and are pleased that our adjusted operating margin was up 130 basis points to 7.9%, ahead of what we
expected. Adjusted EPS was $1.02.
Turning to our Q4 results, constant dollar revenue declined 4%. On a reported basis, revenue was down 10%,
negatively impacted by currency. Units declined 10% with softness in all regions, largely due to a decrease in Active
Representatives as well as pricing actions.
Active Representatives were down 5% led by the continued declines in North America and Asia Pacific. EMEA and
Latin America were both down as well. Price mix was up 6% in the quarter with increases in most regions led by
inflationary pricing in Latin America.
Adjusted gross margin was up 140 basis points to 61.2%, largely due to inflationary pricing in Latin America. This was
partially offset by the negative impact of currency. Adjusted operating margin was down 100 basis points to 8.2% in
the quarter. The decline was primarily due to deleverage given the weaker revenue, partially offset by the higher gross
margin.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 21.6% compared to 37.1% a year ago. This low rate is because the geographic mix
of earnings was different than we anticipated coming into the year as well as the lower cost to repatriate foreign
earnings. Adjusted EPS was $0.34 per share, compared to $0.36 a year ago.
Turning to the regional discussion. You will hear some familiar themes that are impacting us across some key markets
this quarter. As I step back and reflect on the year including the revenue deceleration we witnessed in the second half, it
is clear that we have two important processes that are not working consistently across our markets.
The first is regarding the field; representative recruitment, retention and activity. The second, which we have discussed
with you in the past, is commercial marketing. This includes pricing, merchandising and brochure execution.
Strengthening these processes and ensuring that we execute consistently across our top 10 markets is key for 2014.
Now, I'll start with Latin America. Q4 revenue was 4% in constant dollars, primarily due to strength in average order,
which benefited from price increases across the regions. Price mix was up 10%, primarily due to inflationary pricing in
Argentina and Venezuela, as well as from price increases in other markets including Brazil.
Active Representatives declined 4% and units were down 6%. Brazil constant dollar revenue was up 6%, driven by
average order, which continues to benefit from strong Fashion & Home growth. Constant dollar Beauty sales were up
2% in Brazil, benefiting from strong performance of Christmas gift packs. Personal Care also drove the Beauty growth,
continuing to benefit from the launch of Encanto, our higher end hand and body line that was launched in Q3. In
addition, Fragrances benefited from the launch of Instinct in quarter four.
Fashion & Home sales were up 17% in constant dollars, benefiting from new products as well as strong merchandising
in housewares, children's products and innerwear. We also continued to make solid progress in improving our service
levels in Brazil both sequentially as well as compared with a year ago. We are very pleased that service is improving
across the Latin America region with the exception of Venezuela.

Turning to Mexico, this market is a good example of what I mentioned earlier; namely not executing consistently on
the two key areas of the field and commercial marketing. After strong performance in the last few years, revenue
decelerated meaningfully in the back half of 2013. Q4 revenue was down 15% in constant dollars driven by declines in
both Active Representatives and lower average order.
While we had expected Mexico to weaken, it is disappointing that we are having these executional challenges. The
weaker economy is also having some impact on our results. The management team is focused on reversing this
negative trend and ultimately getting this important market back to growth.
Venezuela was up 29% in constant dollars. The growth was driven by an increase in average order largely due to
inflationary pricing. Active Representatives were down partly due to the macro factors that continue to be disruptive to
the business.
Latin America adjusted operating margin was 9.6%, down 120 basis points. Gross margin was up, benefiting from
price increases in 2013 and the impact on 2012 margins due to the flowing of excess inventory. This gross margin
benefit was offset by increases in representatives' and sales leaders' expenses as well as higher net brochure costs and
increases in bad debt. Unfavorable foreign exchange was also a factor.
As we look forward, Latin America has some challenges and needs to consistently drive representative recruitment and
retention. We also continue to focus on new product innovation and improving our pricing capabilities in order to
continue to drive growth in this region. And of course, Venezuela and Argentina have their own challenges. We're
continuing to stay close to these businesses and working with the teams to mitigate risk where possible.
Moving to EMEA, revenue declined 2% in constant dollars. The region was impacted by market pressures and these
were exacerbated by merchandising and mix issues. And as a result, units declined 7%. We are working to reverse this
trend but the continued weakening of several key currencies is an added challenge as we look to find the right mix
between pricing and unit growth.
Russia revenue declined 3% in constant dollars due to lower average order and a decrease in Active Representatives.
Average order has been hurt by the continuation of the challenges we had last quarter around marketing and
merchandising execution. Specifically, the business suffered from not getting the right product mix. At the same time,
the economic and competitive backdrop is getting tougher. Active Representatives were impacted by both lower
activity and fewer appointments.
This creates a drag into quarter one as we ended the quarter four with lower representative count. We are working to
recover representative count and to improve brochures, ensuring that we have the right mix of products and pricing in
the portfolio. It will take a quarter or so to get this right but the team is very focused on getting back on track. UK
revenue declined 5% in constant dollars. The decline was primarily due to lower Active Representatives. Our team in
the UK is working to drive improved performance in the business, and we are expecting a gradual recovery in 2014.
Turkey revenue rose 3% in constant dollars due to higher average order benefiting from a change in pricing strategy to
reduce depth and increase frequency of discounting. In addition, strong Fashion & Home performance helped the price
mix.
In South Africa, constant dollar revenue rose 2%, primarily due to an increase in Active Representatives. Units were
down due to price increases we took to help offset the impact of the weakening currency. We continue to work on
getting the right balance between pricing and unit growth in this market.
Adjusted operating margin in EMEA was 15.6%, up 110 basis points. This increase was primarily due to higher gross
margin, which benefited from supply chain savings from our actions to reduce material and overhead costs. However,
note that we now expect pressures on gross margin in this region in 2014.
Given that most of our costs are Euro-based, while most of our revenue is in local currency, this will likely negatively
impact our margins beginning in quarter one. We will try to mitigate this with pricing actions, but we may not be able
to fully offset these currency impacts. Quarter one gross margin will also be negatively impacted by the lapping of

significant supply chain and currency benefits we realized in quarter one, 2013.
Turning to North America. This region remains very challenging and reported a 20% constant dollar revenue decline. A
17% decline in Active Representatives was the key driver of the sales decline in Q4. Units were down 27% due to
fewer Active Representatives and commercial marketing challenges. Adjusted North American operating loss was $4
million, primarily due to the impact of lower revenue on our fixed costs. This more than offset savings from our cost
reduction actions. In absolute dollars, SG&A was down. However, it was up as a percentage of sales due to the revenue
decline.
The stabilization of North America will take time. We have a plan to address all facets of the business but some of the
actions could have a short-term negative impact on the business, even though they are the right long-term decisions.
We expect Q1 trends to look similar to Q4 and we will update you as we go.
As Sheri said earlier, Pablo will further discuss our plans for North America recovery at CAGNY.
In Asia-Pacific revenue declined 18% on a constant dollar basis, mainly driven by continued weakness in China, as
well as weakness in our other Asia markets as a result of declining Active Representative. We also lost about one point
of revenue from the exit of Vietnam and South Korea. Active Representative declined 19% and units were down 18%.
Philippines revenue declined 4% on a constant dollar basis due to a decline in Active Representative.
We estimate that about half of the sales decline was from typhoon Yolanda. While the business was down, it could
have been much worse. Under the extreme circumstances, the team did an amazing job getting our sales centers up and
running and helping our representatives get reestablished, which mitigated the impact of the typhoon on our overall
business.
China constant dollar revenue was down 50%, primarily due to the decline in unit sales, resulting largely from a
decrease in the number of Beauty Boutiques. In addition, revenue continues to be impacted by our actions to reduce
inventory levels held by the Beauty Boutiques.
Adjusted operating margin was 2.1% in Asia-Pacific, down 670 basis points. This was largely due to the impact of
lower revenue on our fixed costs and lower gross margins due to unfavorable price mix, higher obsolescence cost and
the impact of lower unit volume. Asia-Pacific overall remains challenging and we expect results to remain soft in the
near term. Our new head of India, Nilesh Patel, is already fully engaged in the business and we will keep you posted on
our progress.
Now I'll take you through four adjustments we made to our GAAP results in the quarter. First, in December we
recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $117 million pre-tax related to the SMT projects. Second, based on the
status of our negotiations with the DoJ and SEC, we recorded an additional accrual for potential FCPA settlements of
$77 million. As a result, the aggregate accrual for these matters at year-end was $89 million. We believe the aggregate
amount of any potential settlement could exceed this accrual by approximately $43 million.
Third, we reported CTI restructuring charges within operating profit of $37 million pre-tax. This was mainly due to
employee related cost related to the elimination of approximately 650 positions. Lastly, similar to the first nine months
of the year, as a result of the Venezuela currency devaluation, we recorded a $5 million charge from using the U.S.
historic dollar cost base of non-monetary assets, such as inventory.
In addition, we recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to Venezuela of $42 million. As a result
of the CTI and litigation charges taken including the FCPA accruals, we have now used slightly over half of our $400
million carved out for cash restructuring and litigation charges related to our financial covenants for our bank revolver
and term loan.
Moving on to cash, cash flow from operations was $540 million for the full-year 2013, $4 million lower than in the
same period in 2012. Cash from operations was unfavorably impacted by the make-whole premiums of approximately
$90 million paid in connection with the prepayment of debt as well as higher payments for employee incentive
compensation. Cash flow from operations was also unfavorably impacted by the $25 million contribution to the UK
pension plan, as a result of our decision to freeze the plan. Partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts was improved

adjusted operating profit.
The overall net cash used for the year was $102 million compared with net cash used of $36 million for the same period
in 2012. This increase is primarily due to debt reduction, which was partially offset by lower dividends paid. Our net
debt at the end of the year was $1.6 billion, which is down $376 million from year-end 2012.
We reduced the overall debt balance by $475 million in the year, of which $64 million was reduced in quarter four. We
are pleased with the progress in this area.
In Q4, we also continued to make progress in working capital which operationally includes six days compared with a
year ago. Accounts payable includes 12 days operationally as we continue to focus on renegotiating payment terms
with our vendors. However, inventory deteriorated by six days operationally. About half of the increase is due to Latin
America, partly due to the strategy to shift from having consignment inventory in Fashion & Home to purchasing that
inventory outright. Inventory and working capital remain a key area of focus for us as we work to improve cash flow.
Thinking about 2014, based on where we are in our turnaround, we're not going to be giving a specific target for the
year. We expect to continue to make progress towards our three-year financial goals of mid-single digit constant dollar
sales growth and low-double digit adjusted operating margin.
In terms of revenue, the recovery is taking longer than we expected and it will take us some time to reverse the trends
that caused the recent deceleration. To that end, we don't expect to resume sales growth until the second half of the
year.
Similarly, first half operating margin is likely to be down due to the comparison to the year ago, which benefited from
one-off. This includes 200 basis points of a combination of one-offs in supply chain and currency benefits we realized
in EMEA in quarter one, 2013. In addition, we expect currency to have a negative impact on margin.
We expect to start off the year with a weak quarter one relative to last year and then witness gradual improvement
throughout the year. In addition, 2014 is not without risks. Clearly, emerging markets and currency volatility are added
challenges and we must make progress [indiscernible] (25:51).
As for CapEx, we currently expect to spend between $200 million and $230 million in 2014. As you will remember, we
told you last year that we expect to spend an incremental $160 million to $200 million on IT CapEx in 2016. Given that
we won't be continuing the rollout of SMT, we no longer plan that incremental spend. Based on what we know today,
we expect to spend about $200 million to $250 million a year on CapEx for each of the next two years including our IT
investments. Our primary focus is to take a more targeted approach to addressing pain points, and at the same time,
improving the return on every dollar spent. As always, we will also continue to focus on working capital improvement
with a particular emphasis on inventory. And as I've always said and strongly believe, it is critical that we focus on top
line, bottom line and cash.
With that said, I'll hand it back to Sheri.
Sheri McCoy
Thank you, Kimberly. As you heard from Kimberly, our performance in the back half of the year was challenged.
Some of these challenges are macroeconomic and outside our control, but in other cases, our performance suffered
from missteps in execution. You saw this in Mexico where our performance was down again in the fourth quarter. In
Mexico, the country's economic slowdown was not the only cause of our challenges, but the missteps we made around
recruitment and pricing actions were exacerbated by the downward economic pressure. We must get consistently better
on our core processes around field management and commercial marketing, but as you might expect this will take time.
We were able to strengthen these skills in some markets last year and building capabilities in these crucial areas is at
the very top of our talent management agenda for 2014.
Going into 2014, we're also looking closely at how to move our market through stabilization to growth. Profitable
growth will come by strengthening and leveraging our direct sales floor and by creating better access to our products

and our brands.
I will talk more about our growth plans at CAGNY next week, including some perspective on strategic alliances. As
you know, earlier this week, we announced a strategic alliance with KORRES, a premium, all natural product line that
we'll be marketing in Latin America.
We're very excited to be adding KORRES to our portfolio in Latin America. It provides us with an upper mast product
line that would drive incremental growth as well as increase our representatives' earning opportunity by giving her
access to a new consumer base.
In closing, I'll say once again, Avon's challenges didn't develop overnight and they won't be solved quickly. And
frankly some parts of the turnaround have been more challenging than anticipated. It will take time and we will have
some ups and downs along the way.
That being said, I believe that 2013 was a year of overall progress for Avon. We put some significant problems behind
us. We're getting the right people in the right jobs and we're implementing plans that I'm confident will lead us to
profitable growth.
Avon is headed into 2014 with a stronger organization, fewer distractions and a commitment to deliver. We'll now open
the line for Q&A.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. I'm with Citigroup. My question has to do kind of with the – what you just talked
about, Sheri. For the health of the organization, you said at the beginning your management team was complete, but
then you talked about all these execution issues. And it sounds a lot – like a lot of that is sort of people-related and
particularly in Mexico and Russia, two huge markets that you've called out as being critical to the long-term health of
the business. It sounds like those are largely execution issues. So, number one, is this really the right time to be taking
on things like strategic partnerships and alliances, when maybe the left hand still doesn't know what the right hand is
doing? And how do we have confidence that in another market like Brazil that you've got the right people in place and
that we can't worry or shouldn't worry about a slowdown there too? Because it doesn't feel like executionally you guys
have made a lot of progress. Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yes. As we look at the opportunities moving forward, the most important thing for us is to focus
on getting our top 10 market right and that's getting the commercial marketing and the field piece of that consistent.
What we've seen is we've actually changed the number of people in the organization. We were looking the other day,
we've got about half of the people at the VP level in either new positions or new to the company. And so we're still
sorting through that. And so as we look at some of the markets, we have made changes and that's an area that we need
to focus.
As we look at what's important moving forward, as we think about growth, it is about getting those top 10 markets in
line and I would say 95% of our people and our energy will be against that. With that said, we still see opportunity for
access to look at how we bring new consumers into the franchise. We would not put it in a place where we don't feel
we have the stable management and that they're focusing on execution. Certainly, if we look at Latin America, we've
been pleased with their progress. Do we have more work to do? Yes, but we'll be very careful and it will be a limited
group of people that will be focusing on strategic alliances. The majority of the organization needs to be working on the
fundamentals. Thanks, Wendy.

<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning. It's Deutsche Bank. Hey, [indiscernible] (32:33) because I know you
don't want to give guidance for the full year, but can you just take a stab at what you think the current impact is going
to be both on the top line and the bottom line?

probably wouldn't be doing this today. So, yeah, but what I will say is we do expect to have some volatility coming
through there. Obviously, Venezuela is also a question mark as well as some of the other markets. What we're doing is
trying to find ways to mitigate the impact where possible, looking natural hedges and we expect that we will have some
impact along the way.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, I'm going to sort of ask a long winded question, because I
know I only get two, but as far as the FCPA goes, I know you accrued for, I think an aggregate amount of like $89
million. Do you think you can pay that over time? Because I think some of the recent settlements where, the, for like
liquidity and the cash payout has been over four years or five years; and then how you got to that $89 million number
and then sort of like what are the two scenarios, where it's that or it's a higher number you talked about. And then the
sort of related to that is how the economics work for these partnerships. So how do you – like the KORRES
partnership, so how you get paid, how they get paid and kind of how many of these do you think you could continue to
do in the future? Long-winded. Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. I'll start with the KORRES agreement and looking at strategic alliances. It's really built
around a loyalty factor. That's primarily how we're looking at that and that's – as we look at strategic alliances, that's
probably where we would start. And so that's how we're thinking about it and I think that's a win-win for both groups.
As it relates to FCPA, Kimberly, I don't know if you want to talk to the accrual fees?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, I think you had a few questions all rolled into one. So we're not going to go into all
the details of it. Obviously it's in negotiation; things are under discussion. What I will say with regards to it is that, as
you know under our covenants, we have this bucket of $400 million that can be used for legal matters as well as for
cash restructuring. And as I said in my notes that a little bit over half of that has been used. So I think we feel
comfortable from a liquidity perspective as well as from a debt agreement perspective that we have ample liquidity to
be able to pay for that. And by the way, when I talk about that number of how much has been used in the bucket, that
includes the amount that's been accrued here for FCPA.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: And as it relates to the range, it was really based on our discussions with the government and
understanding the low end and the high end.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, I'm from Bernstein. So, of the countries you listed in the release that you went through kindly
today, only Brazil and Venezuela look like – and you may add something, I may be wrong, but I think it's only Brazil
and Venezuela where you're growing in constant currency and Brazil's only Fashion & Home and I guess Venezuela's
Venezuela. And I guess ex-Venezuela, as best we can tell, Avon's organic sales decline would have been like negative
5% to 6%. So, if you start with there and you contrast that with what we heard twice now, both at the outset of the press
release and the outset of the conference call, that the company is becoming a more stable business. I'm trying to square
those two. So I'm trying to understand what business-wide steps have been taken to make it more stable. Because we
unfortunately haven't seen it in the results yet. And it doesn't feel like it's controlled strategic shrinking of the business,
so, shrinking to then grow. It feels like it's a little bit out of control. So I'm trying to understand that stability comment

firstly.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: As I look at the business, I think what's important, and we've set financial goals both for top line
cash and operating margin. I think we're making good progress as it relates to focus on making sure we're getting return
on investment in terms of where we're putting money. So I think that's one of the components as I look at stability, is
making sure we understand what the issues are and how we're investing in that. I think what we're seeing, we have
some markets that are performing better than others and it's clear in the markets where we're not performing, what the
missteps have been and what we need to do to address them. So I think that's one of the things that, as I look at the
operational aspects of the business, it's clear what we need to do moving forward.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So...
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Just as a side note on that...
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Yeah.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: ...in Brazil we grew in Beauty as well as in Fashion & Home.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: In Beauty as well? Okay. And I guess on that a little bit, I'm surprised that you feel comfortable
reiterating your 2016 guidance, mid-single digits and low-double. How, in good faith, do you feel given what we've
seen that you can get there at this point?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: So, certainly, as I said we've made progress from an operating margin and cash perspective and
we're continuing to focus on that. What's critically important for us in the goals is that we get North America to a
profitable vision in 2015 and that's really where we're working. In the other areas as it relates to specifically some of
the markets where we had challenges over the last couple quarters, I think we're on track what we need to do there.
What's critically important for us to hit those goals is to get North America to profitability in 2015. And that's what
we'll talk a bit about at CAGNY next week.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. And one other question that harks back to an earlier one, should we think about you more –
and this KORRES deal is interesting, as a distribution company now going forward? Or more still of as a beauty
company?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: I think that we – certainly we are a beauty brand and a terrific beauty brand. And we have
opportunity to leverage that and get more consumers touching our brand. At the same time, we have an incredible [ph]
brand (38:54). And so, what's important for us is to make sure we stay with the beauty heritage, but leverage the
capability that we have as a brand as well as tap into the channel where appropriate and in markets where it makes
sense.

Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Thanks. I'm with Barclays. And I apologize because I just jumped on the call from
another one. In Mexico, I know you mentioned not executing consistently, et cetera. But is there an outlook as to when
the pricing things that you talked about last quarter start to be less of an impact, so you can get back to what has felt
like good cadence previously? And same thing, the Russia question where it has been a matter of merchandising mix.
We knew what we did wrong and we know how to correct it. I know it takes time for that to filter through the
brochures. So, is it reasonable to think that starts to get better in the next quarter or so, or is it still further out?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah, if I address Mexico first of all, I think obviously the team is focused on this and we expect
the return to be gradual. We can more rapidly address the merchandising, pricing issues. One of the challenges that we
had is really the recruiting engine, and so making sure that we have enough people selling. And so we were down
relative to the Active Reps that's where it's taking us a little bit longer. One of the things that the team was focused on
which is a positive, is they were looking at retention and working on trying to retain representatives. In doing that, I'm

not sure they were paying as much attention to recruiting.
And so that's an area that we've put back in place to make sure there's focus on that. So that's what's going to take the
time to get Mexico back in place. I was just in Russia two weeks ago and they're very focused on the merchandising
aspect of it. I was with the sales force and they're very energized about what they need to do; but again, making sure
they get people in from a recruiting standpoint. So it will take us a quarter or so to get back on track, but I have
confidence in the management team that they've got their arms around the challenges there.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Okay. And Sheri, I mean this is just a question for you in terms of the challenges that
you face, just the nature of the business you're trying to manage and get your arms around. Is that it feels like the
explanation for what the challenge is in a given market; it changes pretty quickly. You sort of have, well, jus for an
example, Mexico, now you're talking a bit more about the recruiting, and I'm not questioning that that is an issue, right,
but in the last quarter it was thought it was about pricing decisions and now it's more about execution.
How, as a manager, do you get comfortable that – and I know you've upgraded your management, but that people in the
region that are reporting up to you even really understand what's going on? Because it feels like their excuses for what
happens day to day changes pretty regularly. And that maybe is one of the biggest challenges you face in trying to
stabilize this, is it's a moving target and what do we fix first.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. There are really two fundamental processes that we have to get in place for all of our top
10 markets. And that's the commercial marketing aspect which talks about merchandising and pricing, particularly,
understanding that in a downward environment in emerging markets where we're seeing economic challenges. And the
second is the field piece of it. In Mexico, in all honestly, we saw that it was a challenge, and we knew that going into
Q4 we would continue to have that challenge because we saw it. So, I would say as I've gone around the world and
spent time, it's really getting the capabilities and the focus on both, two critical processes because that's what drives it.
And as we've made changes in the organization, as we've moved people around or brought new people in, we haven't
always got that right. The comfort I take is we know what the issues are and we know what we need to do to focus on
that.
And so, Kimberly and I do spend time once a month with the teams going through this. We're putting even more focus
in KPI, so that we can be more predictive of this recruiting piece and the commercial marketing before it happens. But
it's an area that we have to stay close to as we navigate this turnaround. And frankly, we need to have more of our top
10 markets performing well so if one market has an issue, it's not so impactful on the overall organization. And
particularly with North America not being as strong, any blip we have in some of these markets are just trying to deal
with an economic environment and getting the pricing right, we don't have a lot of room to maneuver. So we just have
to continue to stay focused. As I said to Wendy earlier, we have to stay focused on the fundamentals and the majority
of the organization has to be working there. Thanks, Lauren.

<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thanks. Good morning. It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. First I wanted to ask about the rep
declines. You called out a few countries and you also mentioned challenges so far in driving both recruiting and
retention concurrently. And you also mentioned it's sort of a gradual improvement, so based on all these things, how do
you build confidence in your expectation to get back to organic growth by second half of 2014? And then just one
quick housekeeping, what tax rate are you expecting for 2014? Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. Just with regards to tax rate, we're looking at low to mid 30%s and again that's
excluding any discrete items or any one-offs that we would have in there.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: So as it relates to growth in the second half, we're really looking at some of the markets that were
more challenged as it relates to Russia and Mexico coming back in the second half based on the efforts that we're
putting in place for Active Representatives. The area of the U.S., that's a separate issue that we'll talk to, and there the

focus – it's less about 100% seeing a great improvement in Active Representatives. We want to see measured
improvement, but it's really about profitability. So it varies a little bit by market. But the growth in the second half
really comes from those markets that I referred to, Mexico and Russia.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: And then if I could follow up, you've mentioned Encanto and then the addition of KORRES. Can
you keep trading – can your rep trade up market? I mean, have your reps been looking for something more premium
focused, or can they handle a broader line of products?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: So we've – on KORRES, I'm not going to get into a lot of detail on that because you can imagine
that Latin America is a very competitive market and we want to be careful what we say relative to the competitive
environment. With that said, we have done some work in market with consumers and understand how the propositions
went over, obviously very favorably, as well as understanding price points and what that would look like relative to our
existing lineup. But we do know that there is a consumer appeal for the products that KORRES has both from a
positioning standpoint and price point and we'll be working through how we best execute that.

Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yeah, thanks it's Stifel. One clarification, could you quantify the sales impact in North
America from SMT? And then just more broadly the gap between volume and price has widened in recent quarters. I
guess it just doesn't seem sustainable, and if you agree with that, how do you think about the right long-term split
between those two metrics?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: I'll take the SMT question. So we did continue to have an impact in quarter four from SMT, from
the disruption that we had from the implementation. It was about the same as what we saw in quarter four – I mean
quarter three, sorry. So we don't break out exactly numbers; about couple – 200 basis points on the North America
number. And then as it relates to price/volume which I think was the question in terms of how do we manage. I mean
certainly as we look at it, we look at it from a couple different angles. I think it's important for us as we take the
example of Encanto. This was an area where we had the opportunity to price innovation and got the price mix right.
We've got other products in Latin America in particular in fragrance where we have been able to take that price mix
right. What we do know though, in a place like Mexico is very sensitive and if we go across some magic price points, it
has impacted us.
So, we have to sort through that. At the same time we know – if we look at Venezuela or Argentina, we do need to
price with inflation and we're willing to take the hit in some cases like in Venezuela on units and volume because it's
the right thing to do given where the market is. So we have to look at it in totality. And if I look at what I believe we
need to do for the long-term, it's looking at how we get – move people up to serve as the middle class increases for
price mix based on innovation. And that's where we've had the most success.

Your next question comes from Greg Hessler. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Greg Hessler>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. The first question I had was just around FCPA and with the
accrual, I appreciate the comments there. Can you just remind us on your cash balance, you have access to all of that
cash in the event that, that's the way that you'd like to pay that fine?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. That's correct. So, if you look at our cash balances, about $150 million of it, give or
take is trapped in Venezuela. And then we've said in the past that we need about $300 million to run the business. But
with regards to the rest of it being that we do designated foreign earnings and we continue this year not to designate the
current year of earnings abroad, but we can bring those cash balances back at any point in time to be able to fund
settlements.

<Q - Greg Hessler>: Okay. And just in terms of, I know you guys would sort of prefer to have the investment grade
credit rating. Just in terms of overall – I know you're not giving guidance for 2014, but just in terms of overall cash
generation in 2014, how should we think about uses of that cash, how you might allocate it from a capital allocation
standpoint?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: So clearly, one of our top priorities is
continuing to focus on generating cash. So we made improvements during the year if you take out kind of the one-off
things like make-whole provisions that we had. So continuing to generate cash is important. We would like to maintain
our investment grade rating. We committed with the rating agencies and the Street when we did our debt issuance last
year, to focus on debt reduction and I'm really pleased that we did have debt reduction there.
So we obviously gave information with regards to our dividend this morning on where that is. At the end of the day, we
want to make sure that we maintain the financial flexibility to be able to execute the turnaround of the business, and I
would say that's our number one priority, while at the same time making sure that we have the right capital structure for
the organization.

Your next question comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone. Consumer Edge Research. I have a question with regards to a
comment about direct selling being an incredible channel, and you kind of like know what needs to be done, but at the
same time, this is the worst quarter in terms of rep activity and sales in 18 years. So, how can you have confidence that
in this environment you really know what needs to be done and therefore you can restore growth in the second half and
expand margin in 2014?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. It certainly is – I just came back from the Philippines and really it was clear to me where
you can see the direct selling channel working, where typhoon Yolanda took out a whole portion of the island and
because we have Active Representatives, we can go in and touch people and make a difference quite rapidly. And we
see in that market we hold number one positions in four of the five beauty categories as well as retail. So it's really
clear to me that we have an opportunity. If I go to Brazil, I see that. Even where we're challenged in Mexico and
Russia, I can see the opportunity and the potential for how we're going to continue to grow that business. So while we
are having some missteps, as I look at the channel itself, there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to do that and
make sure we're reaching out to people in different ways. One of the areas that we're continuing to look at as well is the
supplements; our representatives with e-commerce and online so that they have more access so that we continue to
evolve the direct selling channel. But I see that opportunity as a way to reach out to people, particularly in beauty
where we have an opportunity where the representative is the ambassador and really talks about the importance of
beauty and skin care. Have we executed that all perfectly? No. But I still see a lot of value in the channel and that's why
I have confidence that we'll continue to grow [indiscernible] (52:52).
<Q - Javier Escalante>: But, Sheri, rep activity is down 5% and this is the precursor of stale. Essentially you are
losing your sales force. It's kind of like shutting down a store. So how is it that you're going to grow?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: And that's where I said the fundamentals for our top 10 markets and where we're really focused
on two key processes. One is field, which is recruitment and retention and activity, and the second is around making
sure that we get the proposition right so that she wants to come in and sell for us, which is really the merchandising and
pricing aspect of it. And so, that's the area our top 10 markets which represent about 80% of our sales. That's our focus
in 2014, to really make sure that we have the capabilities, that we're doing the training of the organization that we're
continuing to be focused on that.

Your next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Linda Bolton Weiser>: Hi. I'm with B. Riley. I just had a question again on North America. So, operating loss in
the quarter was actually quite a bit not as bad as it was in the third quarter. And yet you say as you fix it, there's going
to be some things that are going to be detrimental to the business. So, I'm just kind of wondering if you could give a
little color on how the profitability will flow. In other words, can we expect another dip in profitability as you take
actions? Or is this actually representative of some improvement maybe because you've been doing some cost
reductions or other things to stem that – the losses in the region? Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: So, as I said in the past with turnarounds, I don't necessarily expect this to be linear as we go. So
what we'll be doing is really focusing on making sure that we're taking the right actions for the long-term sustainability
of that business, taking into account the urgency to turn this business around. So, I don't think I necessarily used the
word detrimental to the business. But we will have some things that could have some impact in the short term.
So we'll be focusing on cost savings both for short-term as well as more the structural items that help us in the long
term in that business, and at the same time very much focused on the field. And I think next week, you'll get a better
feel for what we're doing when Pablo presents at CAGNY.

Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning, it's BMO Capital. I have two questions; one's geographic, the other's
product line. I have found your disclosure on FX in the past to be really solid and transparent. So I guess I'm a little bit
surprised that given the devaluations that have already occurred in Argentina and Venezuela that you haven't quantified
an impact there. And secondly, can you tell us what's going on in France? Because we read that you're exiting, we read
that it's going into receivership, so if you could help on that and then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, so I'll take the question on foreign exchange. So obviously embedded in our numbers
in quarter four, we do have foreign exchange impact to margins in Venezuela. Venezuela has not actually had a
devaluation so the official rate still remains the same. So it's still at 6.3%. So thus there's not an official devaluation
there. Now, in our disclosure what we do provide is from sensitivity testing around Venezuela. So we put in there the
hypothetical that if there were a devaluation of say 50% and just to give you a feel for that, and these are approximate
numbers. The impact would be for a 50% devaluation in Venezuela about 200 basis points on the top line and about
300 basis points on the op profit. And that's assuming that there would be no actions to offset that, which has not been
our experience in the past, because obviously we do pass on some of the costs. And then on top of that, then you have
the one-off like we saw this year with regards to adjustment to the non-monetary assets being carried at historical rates.
I remind you that Venezuela is a bit different because it is a hyperinflationary market, so therefore we do have some
additional disclosures that we provide there; but clearly keeping a close eye on Argentina also as it starts taking some
pages out of Venezuela's books.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: And as it relates to France, obviously we're very mindful of the labor laws in France. Avon
France did file a petition for the suspension of payment which is part of the legal process in France for reaching
resolution on an unprofitable business. So on January 30, the French court announced its judgment to appoint a receiver
to Avon France to facilitate this matter, and Avon France is engaged directly with the French government to sort
through this and we cannot comment any further at this point. I hope you appreciate that, Connie.

Thank you all for joining the call this morning. Before we sign off, as I said earlier, I know that for many of you, the
health of our U.S. business is your top concern. And I want to be clear that it's at the top of my agenda. Pablo will take
you through our U.S. plans when we're at CAGNY next week. It's also important to keep in mind the health of our
other key markets and how we plan to move them through stabilization to growth. At CAGNY, I'll share our growth
