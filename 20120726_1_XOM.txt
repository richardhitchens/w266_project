MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Exxon Mobil Corporation's second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. As a
reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to
the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead sir.
David S. Rosenthal
Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is
ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2012. I will refer to the slides that are available
through Investors section of our website.
Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on slide 2.
Moving to slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic
growth slowed in the second quarter, primarily due to continued weakness in Europe. The U.S. and Japanese
economies are also expected to show declines from first-quarter levels. China growth, while still robust, continues to
weaken from prior-year levels. Energy markets were mixed in the second quarter, with lower crude oil and natural gas
prices, while industry refining margins increased from the first quarter. Although U.S. Chemical margins remained
strong, Europe and Asia commodity margins continued at near-bottom-of-cycle conditions.
Turning now to the second quarter financial results as shown on slide 4, ExxonMobil's second quarter 2012 earnings
were $15.9 billion, an increase of $5.2 billion from the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter earnings included a net
impact of $7.5 billion associated with divestments and one-time tax-related item. Earnings per share for the quarter
were $3.41, up $1.23 from a year ago. The corporation distributed $7.7 billion to shareholders in the second quarter

through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase
shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the third quarter of 2012. CapEx in
the second quarter was $9.3 billion, down 9% from the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to the absence of
acquisitions made in the second quarter of last year. Our cash generation remains strong, with $13.9 billion in cash flow
from operations and asset sales. At the end of the second quarter of 2012, cash totaled $18 billion and debt was $15.6
billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased
from $19.1 billion to $18 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, working capital, and
the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $13.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset
sales. The $9.6 billion in working capital and other primarily reflects eliminations of gains on asset sales, increased
working capital, and tax items. Uses included additions to plant, property, and equipment, or PP&E, of $8.3 billion and
shareholder distributions of $7.7 billion. Additional financing and investing activities increased our cash by $1 billion.
Moving onto slide 6 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's second quarter 2012 earnings of $15.9
billion increased $5.2 billion or 49% from the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to gains from asset sales, partly
offset by one-time tax item. Upstream earnings decreased $183 million, while Downstream earnings improved by $5.3
billion. Chemical earnings were up $128 million, and Corporate and Financing expenses were flat. Corporate and
Financing expenses remained within our continued guidance of $500 million to $700 million per quarter.
As shown on slide 7, ExxonMobil's second quarter 2012 earnings increased by $6.5 billion compared with the first
quarter of 2012.
Moving next to second quarter business highlights, and beginning on slide 8, we continue to advance our global
portfolio of high-quality Upstream projects. In Angola, the Kizomba Satellites Phase 1 project achieved first oil in
May, ahead of schedule. The initial phase has a peak production capacity of 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day and
will recover a total of approximately 250 million barrels from the Mavacola and Clochas fields. The development is
located 95 miles off the coast of Angola in water depths of approximately 4,500 feet. Phase 1 of the project includes 18
wells with subsea tiebacks to the existing Kizomba A and B floating, production, storage, and offloading vessels, thus
optimizing the capabilities of on-block facilities to increase current production levels without requiring an additional
FPSO vessel.
In Nigeria, we completed the installation of three wellhead platforms as part of the Nigeria Satellites project. These are
the first offshore platform structures to be fully constructed in Nigeria. The project is on schedule to start up in late
2012, with peak capacity of 70,000 gross barrels per day.
We also completed the installation of the Arkutun-Dagi Gravity Based Structure offshore Sakhalin Island in Russia.
We are currently progressing pipeline tie-ins with top-sides installation scheduled for 2013. The project will have a
peak production capacity of 90,000 gross barrels per day and is on schedule to start up in 2014.
Construction is also progressing at the Papua New Guinea LNG project, which remains on schedule for a 2014 start-up.
The entire 250-mile offshore pipeline has been installed. And over 105 miles or approximately 60% of the onshore
portion of the main gas pipeline have been welded. At the LNG plant, pipe racks and heavy equipment are being
installed on the process trains, and piling on the jetty is complete. Additionally, mobilization and commissioning of the
first two new drill rigs was ongoing during the quarter. The second rig is being mobilized [ph] to hide, (7:37) with
drilling expected to begin later this year.
Also during the quarter, two rigs began drilling at Hadrian North in the Gulf of Mexico to further appraise the resource.
The results from these wells will be incorporated into the overall development plan.
And finally, the Kearl Initial Development project is now 94% complete. All modules have been transported from the
United States, and integration of the modules into the plant facilities is progressing. The project is on schedule to start
up later this year.

And turning now to slide 9, we continue to make progress on our strategic cooperation agreement with Rosneft. In
June, we signed agreements with Rosneft to jointly develop tight oil reserves in Western Siberia and establish an Arctic
Research Center for offshore developments. This agreement combines the strengths of our two companies:
ExxonMobil's technology leadership in tight oil and unconventional resource development, and Rosneft's direct
knowledge and experience of Western Siberia's geology and conventional production.
In the near future, we will develop a work program for selected Rosneft licensed blocks, which will include geological
studies and drilling, with drilling planned as early as next year. A pilot program will be established to determine the
technical feasibility of developing these reserves. The Arctic Research Center will provide a full range of services to
support all stages of our joint venture oil and gas development on the Arctic Shelf, including ice monitoring and
management, logistics, and the design of ice-resistant offshore vessels, structures, and Arctic pipelines. Safety
standards will be a priority for the Center, which will have its own special marine incident warning and prevention
center.
In addition, we progressed joint exploration activities in the Black Sea, where seismic acquisition is now complete. We
remain on schedule to commence seismic acquisition in the Kara Sea later this year. Exploration drilling is expected to
begin in the 2014-2015 timeframe, as soon as prospect mapping is complete and a rig is contracted.
Turning now to conventional exploration on slide 10. In the quarter, we achieved continued success in our conventional
exploration portfolio. In Tanzania, we drilled a second exploration well with our partner Statoil. As indicated by the
operator, this well has confirmed the discovery of approximately 2 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas. This follows
our first exploration well on the block, which discovered approximately 5 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas. We also
made a gas discovery on acreage in northwestern Papua New Guinea and have commenced drilling of a second well in
the highlands. This exploration activity is designed to support expansion studies for a third train at our Papua New
Guinea LNG project.
Also during the quarter, we drilled our third well in Vietnam, which encountered additional gas. Results from this well
are being evaluated. In light of the encouraging results in Romania, planning for further exploration activity is
underway. We expect to begin acquisition of a new 3-D survey on the Neptune license by year-end. And finally, we
were high bidder on 22 blocks in the recent Central U.S. Gulf of Mexico lease sale.
Moving on to slide 11. We continue to advance our growing portfolio of high-potential unconventional assets in
liquids-rich plays like the Bakken, the Woodford Ardmore, and the Neuquen Basin in Argentina.
In the Bakken, we have moved into a development phase across our roughly 400,000 net acre leasehold. In the first half
of 2012, we turned 40 wells to sales, nearly double the pace of 2011. In the second quarter of 2012, our gross operated
Bakken production increased by 60% over the prior-year quarter. Since our entry into the play, we have more than
doubled gross operated production to approximately 32,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.
In the Woodford Shale in the Ardmore Basin, we completed a strategic bolt-on acquisition, adding 58,000 acres of
leasehold and just over 4,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of production. This brings our total Woodford Ardmore
acreage to approximately 260,000 net acres and expands our resource potential beyond the 600 million oil equivalent
barrels previously estimated. In the second quarter, we utilized 10 rigs to delineate our acreage, evaluate optimum well
spacing, and continue development activity.
Moving to South America. We have drilled two exploration wells in Argentina's Neuquen Basin. Testing of the first
well is under way. The second well is scheduled to be completed and tested in the third quarter. A third exploration
well is also planned to spud during the third quarter. Our efforts are currently concentrated on defining the resource
potential of our more than 800,000 net acre leasehold.
Turning now to slide 12, on the North American Chemical growth project. During the quarter, ExxonMobil Chemical
filed permit applications to progress plans for a world-scale petrochemical expansion at our integrated Baytown, Texas,
complex. The project includes a new ethane cracker with up to 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity, which
will feed two new 650,000 tons per year premium polyethylene lines situated at the nearby Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant.
The proposed expansion capitalizes on the abundant and growing supply of North American natural gas liquids to

economically supply the rapidly growing global demand for high-performance polyethylene products. These
metallocene-based premium resins deliver sustainability benefits such as lighter packaging weight, lower energy
consumption, and reduced emissions. Required government reviews and approvals are expected to take about a year,
after which ExxonMobil will make a final investment decision. If progressed, a 2016 startup would be anticipated.
Turning now to the Saudi elastomers project on slide 13. During the quarter, the KEMYA 50/50 joint venture partners,
Saudi Basic Industries Corporation and ExxonMobil, announced a decision to proceed with construction of the
specialty elastomers project at Al-Jubail, Saudi Arabia. This continues a long history of ExxonMobil investment in the
kingdom and represents a significant broadening of KEMYA's product portfolio. The facility will have the capacity to
produce up to 400,000 tons per year of specialty products, including synthetic rubber, thermal plastic specialty
polymers, and carbon black to serve local markets the Middle East and Asia. Project completion is expected in 2015.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, and starting on slide 14. Upstream earnings in the second
quarter were $8.4 billion, down $183 million from the second quarter of 2011. Realizations decreased earnings by $870
million, due primarily to lower crude oil and U.S. natural gas realizations, which declined by more than $8 per barrel
and $2 per 1,000 cubic feet, respectively. Production mix and volume effects negatively impacted earnings by $330
million, due mainly to the impact of lower entitlement volumes, base decline, and divestments, partly offset by the
ramp-up of Nigeria and Angola projects. All over items, primarily gains from asset divestments and lower exploration
expense, partly offset by one-time tax items and higher production operating expenses, increased earnings by $1
billion. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the second quarter of 2012 were $22.12.
Moving to slide 15. Oil equivalent volumes decreased by 5.6% from the second quarter of last year, mainly due to the
impact of lower entitlement volumes, decline, and divestments. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp-up of
projects in Nigeria and Angola and less downtime. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects,
and divestments, production was essentially flat.
Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on slide 16. Upstream earnings increased by $556 million versus
the first quarter of 2012. Lower crude oil and natural gas realizations negatively impacted earnings by more than $700
million. As crude oil realizations decreased by more than $10 per barrel and average gas realizations decreased by
$0.60 per 1,000 cubic feet. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $480 million due to a decline in
seasonal gas demand in Europe, base decline, and lower entitlement volumes, partly offset by the ramp-up of projects
in Nigeria and Angola. Other items, including gains from asset divestments, lower exploration expense, and favorable
forex, partially offset by one-time tax items, increased earnings by $1.8 billion.
Moving now to slide 17. Oil equivalent volumes were down 8.8% from the first quarter of 2012, resulting from a
decrease in seasonal gas demand in Europe, base decline, and lower entitlement volumes, partly offset by the ramp-up
of projects in Nigeria and Angola. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects, and divestments,
production was down 7.6%. Year to date, oil equivalent volumes decreased 5.5% compared to the first six months of
2011.
First-half 2012 volumes associated with the 3% full-year decline outlook provided at the analysts meeting in March are
shown on slide 18. Operational performance was slightly ahead of plan, benefiting from the early start-up of the
Nigeria Usan and Angola Satellites projects and strong base performance. First-half 2012 prices, most notably in
February through April, were higher than our March analysts meeting outlook basis of $111 Brent and negatively
affected first-half volumes due to both permanent and price-related entitlements. In the second half of 2012, successful
start-up of several projects and continued strong base performance will support our 2012 volumes.
Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results, and starting on slide 19. Downstream earnings in the
second quarter were $6.6 billion, up $5.3 billion from the second quarter of 2011. The driver for the increase was a $5.3
billion gain associated with the Japan restructuring, which was completed on June 1. This gain was partly offset by
unfavorable forex effects, one-time tax items, and increased maintenance activities. Improved refining margins, mainly
in the U.S. and Europe, increased earnings by $650 million.

Page 5 of 15
Moving slide 20. Sequentially, second quarter Downstream earnings increased by $5.1 billion, primarily due to the
Japan restructuring and improved refining margins, partly offset by forex effects, increased refinery maintenance, and
one-time tax items, and the absence of first quarter gains on asset sales.
Turning now the Chemical financial and operating results starting on slide 21, second quarter Chemical earnings were
$1.4 billion, up $130 million versus the second quarter of 2011. Margins decreased earnings by $150 million as lower
commodity margins were only partly offset by improved specialty margins. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings
by $100 million, mainly reflecting weaker demand in Europe. Other factors increased earnings by $380 million, which
includes $630 million associated with the Japan restructuring, partly offset by unfavorable forex effect.
Moving to slide 22, sequentially, second quarter Chemical earnings increased by $750 million, mainly associated with
the Japan restructuring. Stronger margins increased earnings by $160 million, primarily due to lower feedstock costs.
Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $70 million, mainly due to weaker demand in Europe.
And finally, moving to slide 23. ExxonMobil's second quarter financial and operating performance reflects the ability
of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong result. As we continue to focus on operational
excellence, deploy high-impact technologies, and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains
well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with ISI.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug. How are you?
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: I'm doing fine. My question's on foreign exchange effects, asset sales, and tax items, and
specifically whether or not you have functional and geographical quantification on those items in Q2. I mean there was
a pretty large lump in the quarter. And just wanted to see if we could get a little color and segmentation.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, let me – why don't I start with the items in the $7.5 million.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: $7.5 billion, I'm sorry. The primary item in there was $6.5 billion associated with the Japan
restructuring.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Right.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Okay. And the segmentation of that $6.5 billion was $5.3 billion in Japan – I mean in the
Downstream, $600 million in Chemical, $400 million in Corp and Fin, and about $100 million in the Upstream. And
the balance of the $7.5 billion really related to gains on asset sales in the Upstream, primarily Angola Block 31 and a
number of tax-related items.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. And also, in the E&P business, there's commentary that several of the major
integrated gas projects in Australia faced cost overruns – that is, unless budget contingencies were appropriate at the
time. So I wanted to get your insight into trend in investment performance versus budget in Australia, because Exxon's
been in the country for many years, and given that you have significant holdings besides integrated gas, you obviously
hold a unique perspective. So any trends that you could highlight or provide insight into would be appreciated.

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I'll make a general comment, and then for specific project updates, I'd recommend
that you talk with the operator of any specific project. But in general, over the last couple of years, we have seen some
foreign exchange issues with the Australian dollar, as well as across the board there have been upward cost pressures
on labor. And I think those have been well documented in the industry. Other than that, that's all part of normal project
management for us. And you have to find ways to offset those. I think the important thing is on some of these large
projects, in addition to cost management, is to ensure that the project stays on schedule and comes up on time. And that
generally is the focus. But, again, if you had a specific project in mind, I'd recommend you ask the operator for any
specific update.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Sure. Thanks a lot.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Hey. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Just two quick questions. Firstly, buybacks. I mean, obviously you're still maintaining the $5
billion. You did get good sources and uses of cash from acquisitions. And Draghi in Europe is making comments,
which is helping the oil price. But if we do see a slowdown, how do you think about the rate of buybacks being
appropriate? And if the earnings don't support the buybacks, do you see enough disposals in the pipeline to
compensate?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, Ed, I really wouldn't want to comment or provide any guidance on forward
expectations with regard to allocation of funds, other than to say there's no change in our ongoing view of that. And, as
you know, our first priority is fund all of our attractive investment opportunities. After that, it's to pay a growing
dividend. And you'll recall we did raise the dividend 21% earlier this year. And then after that, it's the share buyback to
maintain our capital structure and return excess cash to the shareholders. So no change in our approach. And we'll see
as the year goes along, to how the cash flows turn out given the conditions in the market. But no change in our
approach.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Thanks. And then just a specific one on the operations. Asia gas volumes have been pretty
steady for a number of quarters until the second quarter of 2012. Was that maintenance? Or is that a PSC effect in
terms of a tranche kicking in somewhere?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, let me provide a little more clarity on that, because your question also gets to the
main factor if you look at our volume reqs and you look at the entitlement effects that you saw there. And really the
impact is seen in Qatar. I want you to know that unlike the RasGas and Qatargas LNG trains, the AKG project, which
as you know supports domestic gas sales, does operate under a development and production sharing agreement. And
during the quarter, that project became cost current, and that did impact both the volumes that you see in the region that
we noted, as well as the entitlement volumes that we talked about. As far as performance, performance is expected in
the region, in all the countries there and the assets that we operate. And again, the real impact is AKG becoming cost
current.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And it's fair to think about domestic prices being lower than the other projects, that that would
have a lesser impact on cash flow than the headline production.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes. That would be a correct assumption.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Thanks very much, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: All right. Thank you, Ed.

And we'll now go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, Doug. How are you today?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Not too bad. Thank you. I wanted to go back to one of the events during the quarter, which was I
guess your official exit from Poland. And I really just wanted to get your updated prognosis on shale gas in Europe
generally. And where I'm going with this is, as one of the biggest producers obviously in northwest Europe, what are
the implications for you gravitating back towards export of LNG in the Lower 48? And I have a follow-up, please.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, let me – those are two distinctly different questions. When we look at Poland we did
drill and complete and test two wells, one in each of the two basins that we were in there. And we did not have any
demonstrated sustained commercial hydrocarbon flow from either of those two wells. And so we have decided to end
our exploration activities in Poland at this time.
Now, as you look across Europe there are a number of other opportunities in a number of other countries that people
are looking at, including ourselves. And so I wouldn't draw any conclusions in any one country or across Europe. It's
early days. We have said often, as you look around the world at all the unconventional resource opportunities, they're
all different. They're all in the early stages of evaluation. And it's going to take some time to figure that out.
Now, I will mention, because we haven't talked about it in a little while, our holdings in Germany. And, as you know,
we have a very large acreage position in Germany. And we continue to want to actively explore that. As you know,
we've had some permitting issues there over the last year or so that has held that program up. I can tell you that the
expert dialogue group that has been studying this issue for a while has reported their findings. And like many other
similar studies and findings across the world, including in the U.S., this group did not see any fundamental,
environmental, or other risk aspects that would argue against the exploration and production of natural gas from
unconventional reservoirs. So with that study out, we are in the process now of working on getting our – working with
the regulators, particularly in the local areas and the community at large, to progress our exploration plans and get the
permits necessary to progress. So again, I think every country's different. Every unconventional resource opportunity is
different. And it'd be tough to make any geographic conclusions at this time.
Now, if we switch over to the potential for LNG exports out of North America, we are continuing to study those
options, both in the U.S. and in Canada. As you know, we have vast unconventional holdings in both of those locations.
We have a lot of optionality; a lot of flexibility. We do have some assets in the ground all ready to import LNG. So
we're continuing to study all that and look at our options and the economics, and more on that as time goes on.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks, David. I guess I was thinking that an outlook for European gas would impact your U.S.
decision. That's why I thought it was one question. If I could try a second; it's a very quick follow-up -
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: – on Doug Terreson's second half of his question. You didn't give the FX or the tax impacts by
division. If you could, that would be really helpful. And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Let me first give you the foreign exchange impacts. If you're looking at the second
quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2011, we had about a negative $200 million delta on forex in the
Downstream and another -
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Excuse me, I apologize for interrupting. Could you give us the absolute as opposed to the deltas?

And we'll now go to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Morning, Evan.
<Q - Evan Calio>: How you doing? Hey, a question on Kearl. I know you mentioned the project start-up in the back
half of the year. How should we expect volumes in 3Q and 4Q? And what's the volumetric ramp there in the start-up?
And then, somewhat related, I guess, I believe that 50% goes to Exxon's refiners and then 50% is into the market. I
guess we should assume that you'll feed your own refiners first. And is there any feedstock change in your system as a
result of that?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, sure. Let me hit the status of the project first. It's progressing very well. As I
mentioned, we're 94% complete. I got the modules in place that were in the U.S. and we're progressing towards a late
start-up. That start-up is probably a December start-up. And you know our intention is to ramp up to 110,000 barrels
per day of production from that. But to give you a quarterly number or a specific timing would be real difficult,
because, again, if you're not going to start up till December, it won't have a huge impact.
<Q - Evan Calio>: And what's the expected maybe trajectory to your gross – that 110,000 barrels per day gross?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We'll be ramping that up. Obviously, from the time we start up into the next year, I don't
have a specific ramp-up profile, other than to say as safely as possible. And with the operations running, we'll ramp up
to that 110,000 barrels per day as quickly as possible. But I don't have a specific timeline for you right now.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. On the feedstock?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'm sorry – oh, yeah, yeah.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Yeah, the feedstock question, yeah.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, the first thing I'd say is I wouldn't necessarily say we have a 50/50 mix of what's
going to our refineries versus what's going to go into the market. The other part of your comment is correct. We will
optimize, in general, the placement of those barrels. But certainly having in the flexibility of our own refineries, in
Canada as well in the Midwest, we'll be able to optimize those first and then put the balance in the barrels. But that'll
change depending on the market, which as you know, has been fairly volatile recently. And so if I gave you a split
today, that may or may not be the split six months ago. But you're certainly spot on with your comment about us
optimizing first into our refineries, and then the balance going in the market so that we can maximize the value of all
the barrels really across the whole refining circuit.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. And if I may, just – thank you. If I may, just one other question.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Thanks for the update on the PNG LNG project. And it sounds like you're really moving along well
there. I mean, can you remind us of how much gas, excluding I guess these recent discoveries, is behind that
development and whether – are further discoveries necessary for potential expansion opportunities there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah. First, if you look at the trains, those are two 6.6 million ton trains with start-up in
2014. And as I recall, the total resource backing that up is about 9 Tcf.

<Q - Evan Calio>: Right. So you'd need additional discoveries, likely, to expand, right?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, and that's what I said earlier. That two things are going on. We are certainly
studying the opportunity for a third train. And the positive news is we're having exploration success this year in drilling
some wells. And we have an active exploration program ongoing with a lot of additional acreage that we have available
to us. So it's a positive story with the steel we got going in the ground now. It's positive story on the exploration front.
So we'll continue to focus on getting what we have up and running, while studying for further expansion and
optimization.

We'll now go to Paul Cheng with Barclays.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey. Thanks, and good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hello, Paul. How are you?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Very good. Two quick questions. You've been quite active in the drilling in Gulf of Mexico and
had good success. Are you now all set with all your work requirements for the next, say, one two years, or that you may
need additional equipment there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Well, if you look at what we're doing now in the Gulf of Mexico, probably the biggest
thing we got going right now is the two wells that we're drilling simultaneously at Hadrian North as we continue to
look at that resource. As we go on through the year, we are looking at the possibility of another well in the Gulf before
year-end. But without talking about a specific rig line or what's contracted and what's not, what I could tell you is we
do have flexibility around the rig fleet. We are planning for a sustained exploration program. And when we look at the
opportunities and rig availabilities and the assets that we have under contract, I think we're well positioned to progress
the program. I don't see any constraints or any holdups in terms of equipment availability.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Dave, does your current rig contract extend into, say, the 2013 and 2014, or that is expiring this
year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Paul, I really wouldn't want to comment specifically on rigs and lease arrangements and
that sort of thing. Those are all part of the commercial nature of the business. And so really wouldn't want to get into
any specifics on that.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Sure. The second question that you have to – I have to apologize. It's probably due to my
ignorance. Given the low natural gas price over the last 12 months in the U.S., if the natural gas price stay at say the $2
to $3 per Mcf range, is there a circumstance that would force you guys to look at your proved and reserved booking
from the XTO? And also that – any write-down possibility? Or how does the accounting work from that standpoint?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Paul, if we step back just a little bit, obviously that is a very large resource that we
acquired in the XTO acquisition. Some of it is booked to proved reserves, but a whole lot of it is really in the resource
base. And so when you look at prices and the volatility of those prices and what's going on, I don't think, when you
look at our outlook going forward, that we see ourselves really getting into the issues that you're talking about. And
without getting into any specifics on accounting and reserve reporting, I'm confident that if you look at that resource
and what we've got booked now, and the conservative nature with which we tend to book proved reserves, I'm not
expecting there to be any issues in that area.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So should we assume that the ceiling test, you would be allowed to use your own internal
long-term price deck?

And we'll now go to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: David, good morning. Had a couple of questions for you on two different projects. One is
back to the Gulf of Mexico, on Julia. I know there were some issues with the government a while back. And as I
understand, you've worked that out and you've now retained the block. Can you just give us update on – if I recall, it
seemed to be a fairly large discovery. Any update on timing and activity out there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. I'd be happy to give you an update on that. As you know, we did drill that first
exploration well in 2007. It was successful. We did have some issues with the Department of Interior around that
license. I can confirm the comment that you made: Yes, those issues have been resolved. And, in fact, if I look across
the second quarter, we are working on the development plans for that. In fact, we are really progressing the technical
validation program at this time, and front-end engineering and development. And late in the quarter, we did place some
initial long-lead equipment items. So if you look at the whole broader schedule, we are progressing as rapidly as is
appropriate. But, again, we're already in the process of ordering long-lead programs, working on the development plan,
and the evacuation plan. So that project is progressing.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then the other one was actually on Tanzania. It sounds like
you've got about 7 Tcf discovered to date. I'm wondering, for one, how much you need in order to justify development.
And secondly, my understanding is the government will not approve multiple development, so it's almost a bit of a race
to see who's going have the first-mover advantage. I'm just curious if there's any update on your activity there.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, let me hit the first question on the results in Tanzania. That has been to date a very
successful exploration effort for us. We have said that the first well looks like we got about 5 Tcf of developable
reserves there. And in the second well, looks like we got about 2 Tcf, so for a total of 7 Tcf. I can tell you we are
continuing with our exploration activities. We've got some additional seismic going on this year and may even put
another well down before the end of the year. So that's all going very well.
I wouldn't want to give a specific number in terms of what's required for an LNG project, because it could have
multiple aspects to developing that. And so I wouldn't want to give a specific number there. In terms of the race to get a
project under way, I'm not aware of any constraints on that program. It's still early days in that whole area of East
Africa. As you know, there's been a tremendous amount of activity and some successful discoveries. But to start
discussing order of projects and who gets there first and that sort of thing, I think it'd probably be premature to talk
about that.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.

<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good. Hanging in there. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what's
going on with U.S. natural gas production. It looks like it peaked at about 4 Bcf a day in the fourth quarter of last year,
and it's been coming down kind of steadily. I was wondering if that's a function of your shift in rig count in the Lower
48?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: It's a number of factors. You have to start at the top of that, with base decline across the
conventional resources and the decline that we're seeing there. That's going to be partly offset by the increases in
unconventional gas production. But as you pointed out, we have seen a shift, and that shift continues in our rig count to
the liquids-rich plays. So the program itself is as I've described before. We are managing across the entire portfolio,
which does include continuing to delineate, appraise, and evaluate the dry gas areas while at the same time focusing the
drilling on the liquids-rich plays. The other thing that we've had in there, we have had some divestments. You might
recall we had one in the Gulf of Mexico a year or so ago, and that would decline – would have an impact there. So it's
really a combination of decline, divestments, some shifting of rigs, and then offset by the production increase that
we've seen in the unconventional resources at XTO.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And I believe at the analysts meeting you guys talked about how you were running
maybe just under 70 rigs. I'm not sure if that's still the right number or not. But it seemed like you had shifted to 50% of
those rigs were now drilling in liquids-rich plays. Can you give us an update on where you are with that sort of mix and
rig count?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, sure. We have continued to both reduce the absolute number of rigs running. I think
we averaged about 57 across the quarter. We're currently at about 51 rigs in total. And without giving a specific
percentage, I can tell you the majority of those rigs are working on liquids and liquids-rich plays. And that obviously
would be a continuation of the trend that you've seen over the last few quarters.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Great. Thanks, David. And last question for me. On slide 16 where you talk about the first
quarter to second quarter, sort of a progression of earnings for Upstream, the $1.76 billion sort of other, I believe you
said a part of that was Angola and a part of it was favorable FX. Was the FX sort of movement – was that a absolute
number? Or was there a big change quarter to quarter because of something in the first quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No. Again, it was kind of small. It was less than $100 million. And that would be the
change quarter on quarter. So within that bar, it's not a big effect either way.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.

know, Rosneft has publicly said they're talking to BP about the potential TNK acquisition. If that happens, how do you
see that changing your relationship with them? And second question on the same point, has Exxon contemplated
buying the TNK-BP stake?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Actually, my answer would be the same to both of those questions. I really couldn't
provide any comment on either what others in the industry are doing or anything that we might have going on and are
thinking about.

And we'll now go to John Herrlin with Société Générale.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yes. Hi, David. Unconventional liquids was about 5% or 6% of U.S. oil production or liquids
production. How big do you want to make that on a going-forward basis? I mean, how large a ramp should we
anticipate?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: That's a question I really couldn't answer, because I have no idea what the forward
projections are going to look like. Obviously, there's a lot of activity, a lot of plays. We are certainly heavily involved,
both, as I mentioned, in the ramp-up of our existing fields like we have at the Bakken. But also in the pursuit and
capture of a number of attractive acreage holdings, like we'd mentioned in the Woodford Ardmore and the Utica. So
from an ExxonMobil perspective, I can tell you as we move out of these delineation, appraisal, and evaluation
programs into full development, you'll continue to see the ramp-up that I mentioned in my prepared remarks,
particularly in places like the Bakken and then in some of the other areas.
But we don't have a target. And I couldn't give you a target for the industry. It's really just going to depend on how
quickly these new opportunities that us and others are finding you can get in and get those online. And then of course
you need the midstream infrastructure to evacuate those volumes and get them to market. And to the extent that you're
producing NGLs, there's other midstream infrastructure that has to be put in to process those. So there's a lot of
opportunity. A lot of nice ramp-up kind of across the board, as you mentioned. But it would certainly be hard for me to
give you any indication on what kind of an ultimate target might be either for us or the industry in general.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Thanks. I was only asking about Exxon, but thanks, David.

And we'll now go to Iain Reid with Jefferies.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Hi, David. Good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hey, Iain. How are you doing?
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: I'm doing very well, actually. A couple questions. Firstly, in thinking about your U.S. onshore
operations at the moment, have you got an updated number for either capital employed in U.S. onshore or return on
capital employed, which you're generating at the moment?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, we don't typically give that level of detail, Iain, so I wouldn't have either the capital
employed number or the return on that.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. All right. The second question is about dividends, you obviously made – you made a pretty
substantial increase in your dividend payments. I just wonder, when you're thinking about that, how do you factor in
potential changes in dividend taxes, withholding taxes, in the U.S.? Is that something you think about, or is this a kind
of more fundamental change or increase you've made?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Well, I wouldn't want to – a number of factors, as you would guess, go into the whole
decision-making process about the allocation of cash and that sort of thing. So I wouldn't want to comment on any one
specific factor or even to speculate ultimately what the tax situation might look like, or changes that we might see in the
upcoming several months. So again, a number of factors we think about. We don't try to speculate a whole lot about the
future from the standpoint that you mentioned, so really wouldn't have a specific comment on that.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: But was there something – investors were kind of pressuring you to look at rather than – or as a
kind of add-on to the existing share buyback? Was that part of the rationale?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We spend a lot of time talking to our investors about a number of things. Dividends are
one. Share buybacks are another. Not all the investors are interested or have a weighting to any one particular
disposition over another. Some have one preference, and others have another. We do spend some time looking at the
competitiveness of both our total distributions and the breakout of those, and we do look at that. But in particular on a
specific input or a specific factor in the analysis, I wouldn't give any weighting to one over the other. We do spend time
taking all the factors into consideration, and of course that includes input we get directly from our shareholders.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. All right. The last question for me is on Vietnam. I believe you've proved up quite a
substantial amount of gas now there with these three wells, following on from last year's discovery. Any numbers you
want to share with us about what sort of level of reserves you've proved up? You gave us obviously something on
Tanzania. And maybe you can also talk about the forward program on that?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. I can tell you we are not as far along in assessing what we have in Vietnam as we
were in Tanzania. We're still evaluating the wells there. We had one well that was not successful and two that were.
And so we're still in the early days of looking at that. We've got a lot of work to do. A lot of evaluation to do. And to
assess that, we are looking at additional seismic and other exploration activity, but a little early to start giving you
resource numbers at this time.

We'll now go to Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hey, Paul. How are you doing?
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Fine, thank you. Apologies, I'm traveling today, so I got on the call late. But I did want to ask you
about your specials and the way you declare them. I guess the question is, I completely don't understand why you
declared those specials in the table of specials but then immediately say [ph] they were loaded (56:22) specials.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Paul, let's talk just a minute about the term "specials," and I think I can address your
question. Really you have to think about two different considerations when you're talking about special items. The first
that I'd offer you is if you look at this from an ExxonMobil perspective, both asset divestments and acquisitions have
become a normal part of our ongoing operations. We talked at the analysts meeting in March about the level of
divestments that we've had. If I just look across the last four or five years, I think we've had $26 billion in proceeds and
about $11 billion in earnings. So this is an ongoing piece of the business for us. Some quarters the numbers are a little
larger than others. But in terms of divestments being special, they're a part of the business.
I think the other thing to consider is that the use of the term "special items" has in fact evolved over time, driven in part
by updated SEC guidance on the use of non-GAAP terms. And we are certainly in compliance with that updated
guidance and paying attention to it. And it has evolved over the last few years. So if you take those two factors into
consideration, I think what we've reported here this quarter is consistent with both of those.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: So is that SEC definition a question of materiality, then? And I think the other thing that I find
very odd, David, is that you continue to publish this table of zeros, which just kind of seems inefficient, quite frankly.
But can you just talk a bit more about what you're saying about the SEC? I understand your argument that the
divestments are an ongoing part of your business and therefore shouldn't be considered special. I think that's fine. The
SEC bit?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Without getting into the weeds here, I can tell you that it's not really a materiality
look. It's really around the desire for the SEC for a company to not describe a charge or a gain as a nonrecurring,

infrequent, or unusual event unless it meets certain criteria. And that includes a look back as well as a look forward. So
if you're looking back and you've been doing this stuff in the past and you look forward and you think that you might
have these type of events in the future, the SEC guidance is to not call those nonrecurring, infrequent, unusual, special,
or whatever term you want to use. And again, that has happened over time.
In terms of the table and efficiency, I'll tell you, it's possible. I'm not saying that we'll never report a special item,
because we may. I'm just saying that when we look at the guidance in our business, none of the earnings impacts that
you saw in the quarter qualified to be, "special items."
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Sure, I understand. And if I could just follow up on Paul Cheng, and it's kind of related. I think
that what – you were saying that there would very, very unlikely be a write-down related to XTO. Because I guess what
you're implying is that you were very conservative in booking what is essentially a very, very large resource.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I think it's a couple of things, Paul. It's the conservative nature for which we book
things to proved reserves, and it's also our outlook for natural gas prices. If you look broadly and look at our energy
outlook, we don't have an outlook over the long term that prices are going to remain at current levels. And that's
consistent with our investment plans and it's consistent with our energy outlook. And it's really consistent with the
long-term way we're going about developing these resources.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay, David. Thanks. I think I understand. I'm just wondering if the SEC – going back to that –
allows you to use your own long-term planning assumptions for net gas prices as regards booking?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, that's correct.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay. That's good. Thank you.

Operator
And we'll now go to Allen Good with Morningstar.
<Q - Allen Good>: Good morning, David. Just one quick question on Lower 48 activity. It looks like you made pretty
good progress in reducing the rig count there and moving towards liquid-rich plays. But if we look back sort of a year
ago, you were at 70 rigs and natural gas prices were at $4. And certainly they've made quite a recovery off the lows we
saw earlier this quarter. And whether that's sustainable or not is certainly a question. But is the $4 level something to
think about that Exxon may potentially return to gas drilling? Or given the low base of rigs you're working off now,
there certainly would have to be different conditions where you would revisit some of these gas plays that you've
moved away from over the past six months?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I think the answer to the question and what you're seeing us doing is really more
reflective of our longer-term approach to this. We are still drilling in dry-gas areas. We do continue to drill wells in
order to work on our delineation and our evaluation of those plays to make sure that, again, over the long term, we want
to be in a position to maximize the recovery and maximize the value generation from those resources. So that hasn't
changed. What you have seen that we've talked about is both a reduction in the total rig count, and some of that, of
course, is in response to the short-term pricing that's happened.
In addition, the move of a lot of the rigs over the liquids and liquids-rich plays is really both to start to delineate and
appraise and think about developing our new acreage, like the Woodford Ardmore, again, as well as ramping up in the
Bakken. In fact, I think I heard the other day we're up to about 10 rigs in the Bakken out of those 51. But we really
don't have a price trigger to any big extent. You might do something a little different at the margin in any given quarter
depending on prices, but when you really look at the overall plan and the overall strategy, it continues to be with a very
long-term view of this very large, very high-quality resource we got.

<Q - Allen Good>: Okay. In the short term, though, do you expect that 51 rig total you're currently running, is that
enough to do everything you want to do as far as evaluating those plays and driving production at liquid-rich plays? Or
would we expect during the short term to see that rig count continue to fall?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I really don't have an outlook going forward for the rig count. We continue to progress the
program, and we can see some variability around the number that I mentioned. But I really couldn't give you an outlook
in terms of either direction or rig count specifically.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: All right. Thank you very much.

It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Rosenthal, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any
additional or closing remarks.
David S. Rosenthal
Yeah, I'd just like to thank everybody on the call today, and thank you for your questions. And we'll look forward to
visiting you again next quarter. So thank you very much.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.
