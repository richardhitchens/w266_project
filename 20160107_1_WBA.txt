Stefano Pessina
Thank you, Gerald. Good morning everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to
report that the year started with a comparatively strong first quarter as we expected. Our ongoing work to control costs
across the company and improve adjusted operating income margin is growing earnings over all with adjusted diluted
net earnings per share attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance up 32.1% compared with a year ago period to $1.03.
Although it is early in the year, we are on track to deliver against our expectations. In addition to the encouraging
organic results from all three of our divisions, we continue to work hard to develop the company. We have taken a
significant step forward with our proposed agreement to acquire Rite Aid, and we remain focused on building new
partnerships. In December, after the quarter ended, we announced a fulfillment agreement with Valeant, which we
believe will enable consumers to conveniently access the Valeant products at lower cost.
I will come back to this later, but now will hand over to George to talk us through the financial performance for the
quarter.
George Fairweather
Thank you, Stefano. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Starting with the first
quarter highlights, net sales were $29 billion, up 48.5% on the same quarter a year ago largely due to the inclusion of
Alliance Boots.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.5 billion. Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1
billion, and diluted EPS was $1.01. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $1.7 billion, up 53.8%. Net earnings
attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion, up 51.1%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.03, up 32.1%.
These results are of course not directly comparable with first quarter of fiscal 2015 due to the Alliance Boots
transaction in December 2014 and the resulting changes in segmental reporting.
Key factors driving our performance versus the same quarter last year were the Alliance Boots transactions and growth
in the retail Pharmacy USA division. Total Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.4 billion, an increase of 4.2% over the
same quarter a year ago. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 5.8%, driven by strong pharmacy volume and
mix. Total sales growth was lower than comparable store sales, primarily due to the sale of our infusion business and
store closures during the past year. Adjusted gross margin of 27% was 30 basis points lower, primarily due to ongoing
pharmacy margin pressure. This resulted in $5.5 billion of adjusted gross profit, up 2.7%. Adjusted SG&A was $4.2
billion, a decrease of 2.1%. This reflects the meaningful progress made in our cost savings program while maintaining
our customer experience.
The division's adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, up 11.2%, giving an adjusted operating margin of 6.1%, up
40 basis points. Excluding Walgreen's share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the year ago quarter, adjusted
operating income for the division grew by 22.9%.

So turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy, pharmacy sales were up 6.7% for the quarter. 231 million
prescriptions were filled on a 30-day basis, including immunizations, an increase of 4.1%. On a comparable store basis,
pharmacy sales increased 9.3% with comparable scripts filled up 4.7% overall. Overall, we are pleased with our
top-line growth, especially given the weak start to the cough-cold-flu season this year. According to IMS Health,
reported incidents of flu across the USA declined by 10.7% compared with the year ago quarter.
Our increase in comparable store scripts was driven by our Medicare Part D growth strategy where we grew market
share and a greater focus on customer care. This resulted in our refill prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted
basis increasing by approximately 20 basis points over the year ago quarter to 19.2% as reported by IMS Health.
Consistent with our expectations, we experienced pressure on pharmacy gross margins. These were negatively
impacted by lower third-party reimbursements, an increase in Medicare Part D mix, our continuing strategy of driving
90-day prescriptions at retail, and the mix of specialty drugs which carry a lower margin percentage. This was partially
offset by additional brand generic drug conversions. Although we continue to anticipate gross margin pressure, we
remain confident in our ability to grow pharmacy part of our business over time. Our strategy to deliver this is to drive
access to critical programs such as Med Part D through building deeper payer relationships and through developing
innovative partnerships such as our recently announced agreement with Valeant.
Since the quarter end, in December, our pharmacy sales were impacted by the continuing weakness in the
cough-cold-flu season. Retail sales decreased by 90 basis points over the first quarter of fiscal 2015 with sales in
comparable stores down 60 basis points. This was primarily due to a reduction in unprofitable promotions as we
increasingly focused on our key health and beauty categories. Additionally, as part of our strategy, we transitioned
seasonal items away from holiday decorations which were historically sold on Black Friday and in the November
run-up to Christmas with higher-quality giftable items that sell throughout the holiday season this led to an anticipated
fall of sales in the quarter.
While gross margin was essentially flat, overall retail profitability increased due to the lower costs. Since the quarter
end, December comparable retail sales were relatively flat with positive results from our strategic shift to health and
beauty, wellness and seasonal categories, offset by the weak cough-cold-flu season. We believe that our fundamental
shift towards health and beauty is resonating with our customers and is an important point of differentiation. Having
conducted pilots in over 400 stores, we're excited by the positive results we have seen, particularly for No7 and Soap &
Glory. As previously indicated, we're expanding our differentiated beauty offering to approximately 2,000 stores with
the rollout plan to begin in summer 2016.
So turning now to our Retail Pharmacy International division, which has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail
businesses in eight countries, the biggest business being Boots in the UK. Total Retail Pharmacy International sales for
the quarter were $3.5 billion, pro forma constant currency comparable store sales being up by 2.2%. Adjusted gross
profit was $1.5 billion with an adjusted gross profit margin of 42.6%. Adjusted SG&A was $1.2 billion. The division's
depreciation charge marginally benefiting from purchase price accounting refinements in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income was $350 million, the adjusted operating margin of 8.9% being higher than in the
seasonally weaker fourth quarter as we expected.
On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable pharmacy sales for the division were up 3.8%. Comparable retail
sales up 1.3%. Boots UK's comparable pharmacy sales increased by 3.5%, mainly as a result of additional high-value
drugs dispensed in its hospital pharmacies higher average value – higher average item value and growth in pharmacy
services such as flu vaccinations.
Comparable retail sales growth at Boots UK was 80 basis points, growth coming mainly from Boots.com albeit at a
lower rate than in previous quarters. As in August, Boots anniversaried its improved order online, collect in store offer.
Cosmetics were the best-performing retail category in the UK, led by a strong performance in premium, No7, and Liz
Earle, which we acquired in July. In November, we added another exciting brand to our portfolio, Sleek MakeUP,
which has a young and ethnically diverse customer base. Sleek is currently sold in over 100 Boots stores [audio gap]
(13:37) doing with Liz Earle.

Outside the UK, we delivered particularly good comparable sales growth in Mexico and in the Republic of Ireland.
Benavides in Mexico while currently a lower operating margin business than Boots is a key priority for expansion, and
we're working hard to find innovative ways to accelerate our store opening program.
Since the quarter end, December performance has been encouraging. Boots UK's retail sales growth was higher than in
the first quarter due to a strong online performance. Sales of our exclusive range of seasonal gifts were particularly
good.
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Overall, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division performed
in line with our expectations during the quarter. Total sales were $5.8 billion. On a pro forma constant currency basis,
excluding acquisitions and disposals, comparable sales increased by 3.1% over the same quarter in 2015.
This was slightly ahead of our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales. As in
the prior quarter, sales growth was particularly strong in Norway and we continued to see good growth in Germany and
Turkey, two of our largest markets. Adjusted operating income was $166 million in the quarter and the adjusted
operating income margin was 2.9%.
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the Alliance Boots program were $288 million so we are very much on
track to deliver our goal of reaching at least $1 billion in fiscal 2016. As I said on the year-end call, we continue to
identify and action many other synergies which is simply not practical to quantify as they blend into our core
operations.
At the same time, we're continuing to make good progress to deliver our $1.5 billion cost savings program and remain
on track to achieve this target by the end of fiscal 2017.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $732 million, reflecting our typical seasonal build in inventories. As I said on
the last call, we continue to seek ways to deliver further working capital efficiencies particularly in the U.S.
Capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $340 million, which was just below the amount spent in the fourth quarter of
last year. This reflects our drive, which I, again, talked about on our last call, to invest in key areas that develop our
customer proposition including information technology. Free cash flow for the quarter, therefore, netted to $392
million.
Since our Rite Aid announcement, we've made good progress with the funding. In December, we completed the
placement of $5 billion term loan facilities and the syndication of a new $7.8 billion bridge facility. These new
facilities replaced our previously reported $12.8 billion bridge facility commitment. Drawings are, of course, subject to
the closing of the acquisition.
So let me now conclude with some comments on guidance for fiscal 2016. As you all have seen in this morning's press
release, we've raised the lower end of our fiscal 2016 guidance by $0.05 per share to a range of $4.30 to $4.55. This
continues to assume no material accretion from the agreement to acquire Rite Aid, the previously announced
suspension of the balance of the $3 billion share buyback program, continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback
program relating to stock incentives, and no significant changes in currency exchange rates.
Please remember that we have currency translational exposure based primarily on movements in the pound-sterling
versus the dollar. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause quarterly
volatility in the sales gross margin and SG&A item lines. The guidance I have just provided reflects current currency
rates and so factors in a headwind of around $0.03 since we provided our initial fiscal year 2016 guidance back in
October.
So I'll now hand you back to Stefano.

Thank you, George. So the company has performed well overall in the first quarter and I want to come back to that in a
moment. I would like first to update you on a few of the things that we have been working on in the quarter and [ph]
since its growth (19:22) that has not had a direct impact on the quarterly performance [ph] and the (19:29) review. As
you have heard, we are not assuming our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid will provide any material accretion in fiscal
2016, but I would reiterate that this transaction is progressing as we expected and planned. We continue to anticipate
completing the acquisition in the second half of calendar year 2016.
The transaction remains subject to approval by Rite Aid shareholders, regulatory clearances and other customary
closing conditions. Rite Aid has issued their property and their stakeholders' meeting to approve the transaction is
scheduled for the 4, February. We are continuing to work closely with everybody. You will have seen [ph] as we
expected (20:26) that we have received the second request from the FTC for additional information. This is a standard
part of the regulatory process in connection with the FTC's review. Shortly after the announcement of the proposed
acquisition we appointed a highly experienced infusion team which has been up and running since the end of
November. They are now well underway on preliminary planning work.
In December we also announced our agreement with Valeant Pharmaceuticals. This agreement though new to the U.S.
market has some similarities to the way we work with a number of pharmaceutical companies in Europe. It is a really
good example of how we can transfer existing experience and understanding from one market and adapting to another.
The two main parts of the agreements combine to provide Valeant with the opportunity to serve a far wider patient base
at a significantly lower cost and the potential to both grow their business and improve convenience and service level at
an overall saving to the healthcare system.
From our point of view, we have the potential to offer patients the medication they want and have been prescribed with
a high standard of counseling and service in a manner that makes good use of our infrastructure and professional
capabilities.
So as we look at our business today and what we are seeing up in our dynamic and changing markets is that serves a
number of global [ph] teams (22:19) that I believe to be inevitable for some time. In healthcare, we are continuing to
see increasing demand on the existing system of both preventative and therapeutic treatments. This is only compounded
by inflationary pressure of new innovative and correspondingly high cost [ph] products and procedures (22:42). In [ph]
desire (22:45) is to mitigate this pressure and provide more and better care at lower cost, our pharmacists stands out as
being one of the most convenient, flexible and lowest cost means of meeting the challenges which the system faces.
Our agreement with Valeant demonstrates how we can use our pharmacy network to improve access and service level
while reducing costs in the healthcare system. As we have seen in Europe and elsewhere, we believe that when we
work in close alignment and true partnership with Valeant in the sector, we can achieve immense benefits both in
service level, therapeutic care, cost savings and of course in financial rewards for both our partner and ourselves. This
is why I want the partnership to become a characteristic by which our company will be known, as good partnerships
delivers real value. As you know, our pharmacy services operate in close alignment with our retail activities. In retail
we are at the beginning of a journey to focus on our customers' true needs and to differentiate our retail offering. We
have seen real changes taking effect and supported by good operational disciplines, this will deliver growth for the
future.
Like all other retailers, we have also seen an acceleration in the U.S. in customers moving towards omni-channel retail
with online shopping working in parallel and integrated with physical stores. This is the trend that we have seen in
many of our markets, more particularly in the UK where we have adopted our models to embrace this trend. We must
now decide how to deploy our expertise and experience to maximize the opportunities which this trend presents
worldwide. Today, we have delivered what I believe to be a strong performance of a business in the process of
transformation.
Looking forward, there is no doubt that we still have a lot of work to do within our core businesses to optimize them for
their existing market, to introduce new products, services and ways of working and to further enhance our spending
with our customers. These are fundamental drivers that I believe will help us to deliver the long-term earnings growth
that we are confident to achieve.

As a company, we continue to look at new areas of business to add to our portfolio, we continue to find opportunities
complementary to our core operations professionally, commercially and geographically that will help us grow the
business and enhance its financial performance. Ultimately, our success relies on the quality and commitment of our
people globally. Their experience, expertise and drive will improve our business every day. The commitment I see from
our team gives me great confidence that we will deliver what we have seen of fiscal 2015 and beyond.
Now let's open up for questions. Gerald?
Gerald Gradwell
Thank you. Brian, we're now ready for question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Your line is
now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Gregory Wiltamuth>: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the Boots side of the business.
You have a shift in strategy there where you are focusing more on top line growth rather than margin, I wanted to see
what's the progress there on the margins at Boots and then I wanted to ask a little bit about what you think about the
opportunity to turn around Rite Aid longer-term?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Well, first of all, we have not shift our strategy. We are pursuing both sales and margin. Of
course you don't have to judge on a single quarter. We have a program which has been designed over many years and
we are managing the company in the long term. First we try to be as good as possible each single quarter but this is not
our ultimate aim. Our ultimate aim is to transform this company. So from time to time you will see a prevalence of the
sales or the prevalence of the margin and maybe you, Alex, can expand on this.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, thanks, Stefano. Yeah, [indiscernible] (27:55) knows Boots very well from the past and I
think that where we are in Boots is a pretty good stage. I think as Stefano indicated, Boots is very well established in
the UK, enormously loyal customer base which I find the team they're [ph] successfully (28:10) growing. So for the
first time in many years, [ph] they're (28:14) starting to grow [ph] a bit forward (28:14), grow customer base in Boots
UK using an omni-channel strategy. So the same great products, the same great positioned stores, the same great people
[indiscernible] (28:23) many years, but now we're expanding and using the new technologies, customers are engaging
with both here in the U.S. and also globally but particularly in the UK I think George has said already.
And in terms of Rite Aid, we're feeling pretty good about Rite Aid. They announced the results [indiscernible] (28:41).
Now we know there's five years and things they've done also in their front end in growing sales that we can learn from
as well. And, as always, the idea here is to put the companies together in a way that allows us to really get the best
practice from both companies here in the USA while importing some of the best ideas from other markets.
<Q - Mark Gregory Wiltamuth>: And do you think you'll have to put a lot of capital into the stores to drive the
turnaround in the Rite Aid base?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Again, we are really in the early stages. We know this space very well. Our team in Walgreens
obviously knows the Rite Aid space extremely well and we don't think this is a big problem. They've got a good
investment program in about 2,000 of their stores already, over 2,000 stores, and we believe that with an appropriate
investment and importantly as George said, appropriate returns we can get the right sales and margin mix in Rite Aid
over time.

<A - Stefano Pessina>: But what is important – Stefano again – what is important to understand is that we couldn't
have a better time for this deal because in reality we are already investing a lot of capital to transform Walgreens, to
transform the stores in Walgreens. And so at the end, these will be just an extension – the integration of Rite Aid would
be just an extension of the work that we are doing [indiscernible] (30:05). If we had done this in three years' time,
probably we would have had to start from scratch. Now we will just continue in the work that we have to do in any
case.
<Q - Mark Gregory Wiltamuth>: And, Stefano, now that you've done this big horizontal acquisition, do you think
there's a possibility of going vertical with your acquisitions moving forward and maybe contemplating a PBM
transaction?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Yeah, you know what I think. I couldn't have been clearer since the very beginning. I have
seen this market and I am really convinced that the vertical integration is a necessity [indiscernible] (30:47). It's part of
what we have to do to reduce – to control the costs in the healthcare arena. Any kind of vertical integration is good. It
depends on the opportunities that we will have. It depends on the availability of partners. And also there are many ways
to have a multiple [ph], I think, (31:12) a vertical integration. You can have a merger which of course is the perfect way
but you can also have commercial agreement, a very strong commercial agreement and very strong partnerships, and as
we have said many times, we are always open even for a partnership.
<Q - Mark Gregory Wiltamuth>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Great. Thanks very much and good morning. So Stefano, can I just follow up on what you
just said around a strong commercial agreement or a partnership as it pertains to a PBM? Is that something that we
should expect to see Walgreens announce with one or maybe more than one PBM as we think about putting together
partnerships, in your word, over the next 12 months to 18 months? How do we think about putting this into context and
your overall thought on strategy?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: I'd like to give you an answer because this will mean that I have a clear idea and a clear target
for the next period. Unfortunately, you have to realize that we have just done a deal, we have to digest the deal that we
have done. We have to look around and at the right time when we would be prepared, we will tell you which kind of
deal and when we can execute the deal. But we have done two big deals in less than one year, give us the time to
organize ourselves. [indiscernible] (32:59) let's be clear, it's a problem that we are very rarely [ph] speak (33:03) we
know what we can digest, what we can [ph] afford. (33:07) And so at the right time, we will come back to you.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay. And then secondly, when you talk about the Valeant deal, you talked about the fact
that you view this as a first stepping stone and maybe some other opportunities in the market. So I guess I have two
questions there. The first would be, do you have specific manufacturers you're discussing opportunities with today?
And then the second part is for George. Is there any contribution in the updated guidance from the new Valeant
relationship?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Well, the first part of the question, I can tell you that we are – again, we have just done this
deal, we have to execute properly this deal. We have to show that we are absolutely able to manage these kind of
relationships that we have demonstrated many, many times in Europe, and after, we will think about a potential deal if
we will find other partners.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: And any financial contribution?
<A - George Fairweather>: Yeah. On guidance, obviously guidance includes everything for this fiscal year. I just
would point out obviously that we are only shortly going to commence and start to roll out the Valeant program and of
course as ever when you bring a new program, there's various startup costs that have to be incurred when you go down

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Good morning, gentlemen. So on the cost side, in the U.S. business, looked like versus what we
saw in the fourth quarter, you made some great progress. And I think there you had maybe had some upfront costs at
the end of the year. Can you just help us understand in terms of the progression? I mean it's pretty obvious on the
synergy side how well you're doing but on the larger plan, the $1.5 billion plan. What are some of the examples of
projects where we see more of the upfront savings and then how do we think about some of the longer dated projects
that will deliver maybe some value there over the next, I don't know, 18 months or 24 months?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah. Hi. It's Alex here. Hi, Ross. Yeah. Some of the examples which are maybe more of the
operational examples, we've spoken about these before. Obviously, we've confirmed [ph] which of the (36:01) stores
and we're sort of well over halfway through that program, and that's going pretty well. We have reduced some [ph]
opening hours (36:08) as appropriate to make sure that we're able to give better care when more customers are actually
in our stores. We've swapped our photo labs for dry photo labs using digital technology and obviously, it's been a great
success on the cost side but also important in the growth side as well.
So these are some of the structural changes that we've been doing so far. We've done some nice work, I think, in
centralizing a lot of pharmacy operations which allows our pharmacists to give more attention and care to customers at
the counter while reducing costs substantially in the cost to fill and all of these are programs that we continue to run
into the future. We're not short of ideas. We have a very strong operational and IT team here and we're working on all
the things we can do to reduce workload throughout the company but particularly at our stores so we can take better
care of the customers. And we've got a lot more to go at, [ph] both in the plan (37:05) and other ideas that we will
develop over the next period.
So we believe these are sustainable changes. We believe importantly the customer care numbers that we measure
internally are going up as well. [indiscernible] (37:18) work, taking better care of customers, taking [ph] buy (37:21)
cost out and starting now to reinvest back in the costs that are most important to the customers, have more people in our
shops to serve them as appropriate and obviously getting the value proposition right as well for customers both in
pharmacy and also in the front end. So that's where we are on the cost program, bang on track and more to come on
developing more opportunities for the future.
<Q - Ross Muken>: And maybe getting back to the broader-based question on vertical integration, I think as, Stefano,
you said, merger is always preferred and that makes sense because then you have control. On the other side, going on
Lisa's question, with maybe agreement or partnership or something of the sort, what do you need to have accomplished
in something like that? And what are the challenges in making sure the sort of economic benefit to the two sides are
equivalent and that both parties are sort of working for the good of each other and the customer?
I mean what are maybe conceptually the things that you think you need to get out of it? And then I stated some of the
obvious challenges. But what are some of the others in terms of not having necessarily control over the whole
relationship and only hoping that your partner, whomever that may be, sort of participates in the same way? Obviously,
you got there on Valeant and you've done it before so I'd just love sort of some broad context.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: First of all, let me say that I have never ever spoken about the control. What we want is to do
something which creates the value, long-term sustainable value. We have never spoken about control. We have done

many, many deals when at the end we have lost the control and it's by chance that many of our [ph] managers (39:29)
have come back and this was not the design. It was just the force of things. When you merge a company, when you
merge two companies, you have one company and of course all the people of the previous two companies are members
of the new company and you have just to try to select the best people for the best [ph] hopes (39:59) and the people can
come from everywhere. So we have never ever – I can tell you, I can assure you, never ever done a deal with the idea
of controlling the resulting company, first of all.
Secondly – so we are open at any merger, we are open at the merger where we could have the control, a merger where
we could cede the control, a merger [ph] of equals, so (40:34) we would be open to everything which would create, I
repeat, a substantial and sustainable value immediately and in the future for the company. This is for the merger.
For the commercial partnership, of course, you can imagine many, many different kinds of commercial partnership.
Valeant is a really good example, but there are other kinds of partnerships that you can do on the cost side, on the
margin side, creating synergies that you can share and there is [ph] nothing more than that (41:25). Every time you
have to discuss and you have to see what is the best way to create value and how to share the value, but if you approach
these discussions with an open mind, maybe sometimes it's possible to find a solution. Alex, you have seen many of
these joint ventures, commercial joint ventures in the past, so you can say something maybe.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: [indiscernible] (41:57) I think the thing that's important here is to create the win-win. And for
example, in Valeant, what we see is the opportunity to really take friction out for customers and patients and doctors
and pharmacists, so they can spend more time with patients and therefore patients win. So the whole idea behind
Valeant is, I think, Stefano said in the introduction, really is about taking friction and cost out of the interactions
between healthcare professionals and giving more time to customers. We're becoming more of a services company.
We've been [ph] paid for (42:28) things which have to do with the job of pharmacist which is providing – actually
dispensing and making sure people understand their drugs properly and that is great for a pharmacist and great for
profession. And we've committed [indiscernible] (42:42) committed as to, over time, ensuring that we independently
monitor that we deliver more costs in the system as a result of working [ph] differently (42:52) together.
That's the example we're developing in the U.S., and we will take our time to get this right and make sure that we
implement in a way that is appropriate for the system [ph] to work (43:03) in America. There's lots of examples in
Europe which I could go into as well in terms [indiscernible] (43:09) in a way that creates win-wins and ensures that
we deliver better care at low cost and that's really what the partnership strategy is all about.
<Q - Ross Muken>: That's super helpful on my end, and I as well look forward to seeing you guys next week. Thank
you.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Thanks so much. I actually had a PBM question as well. I know you guys don't provide
specific timelines for the large PBM contracts, but based on previous public announcements, it would seem that you're
about three years to four years in to the contract with the three largest PBMs. So I'm just curious is there anything you
can share as far as how we should be thinking about timelines for renewals and maybe directionally how you feel
reimbursement might match up relative to historical reimbursement rates?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi. It's Alex here. Hi, Robert. Again, we don't discuss these contracts [ph] openly (44:07) so I
can't comment on the timelines. What I can comment on is that our strategy is to improve access, access to customers
and access by having [ph] good (44:16) partnerships as we said before with everyone in the marketplace. And I think as
we probably said, we're working hard with all the major partners to improve access and also to drive the business
forward. If you look at the performance of Part Med D and you see again it's been a successful strategy.

We're well set up again for this season. These are annual contracts [ph] in the main. (44:40) They're becoming more
sophisticated as we also know being paid for some services within these contracts and again we're determined to give
better volume, better care within these contracts. And we're starting to gently but progressively improve relationships
and grow share.
As George has said, we grew share again in the quarter which we're pleased with, but we know we have a lot more to
do. So that's where we are. So we're feeling more confident in our relationships with the PBMs. We're feeling more
confident as we give better value to the market in terms of both price and quality of care. We get a better return. And
we'll continue to develop our strategy over the months ahead.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: That's great. And then I guess just maybe go outside the U.S. for my follow-up, really
solid performance in the retail international segment both from the sales and EBIT perspective. But if I look at the
constant-currency same-store sales growth there, it was about 2.2%, kind of a step-down from what you've seen the last
several quarters. And then on the flipside, the EBIT margin came in much higher than we've seen, significantly higher
than what we've seen in the last three quarters. Could you maybe just help us walk through some of the dynamics at
play in the retail international business? So what's driving kind of outside of same-store sales growth, the strong sales
performance? And then on the margin, what's contributing to that upside and how sustainable could that level be as we
look across the next three quarters of fiscal 2016?
<A - George Fairweather>: Okay. I'll try and have a go at this. I mean there's always an element of mix but I think
that one of the factors that I tried to draw in is obviously we're continuing in – the biggest business is Boots in the UK,
is the biggest business in the division, continuing to perform well as I said we had, in looking at the sales, where
omni-channel is and Boots.com in particular is a very important part of our growth strategy.
We did in the summer anniversary just at the beginning of August our much faster online collect-in-store offer. So
we've seen the impact of the growth of that coming through, then the anniversary, then we brought in some new
development. So we saw this improvement coming then back up again into the December numbers, which together
with the strong gifting meant that we've had a good Christmas in what's been a particularly competitive environment.
So in those businesses, it's really about having a differentiated front of store offer and then increasingly supported by
omni-channel. And of course, in Boots in the UK, we're able to piggyback on the Alliance Healthcare distribution
system to do that. So if you look at Boots' performance and certainly it's still early days. We're just starting to see some
of the figures from our competitors on the high street, but I think what's coming through pretty clear is that Boots is
continuing to be a real winner there.
In terms of the margin, really two points. One, there's always a seasonal impact given the importance of the retail part
of our offerings in Retail Pharmacy International. And of course, we started to see the buildup in November because it
tends to be that people start their Christmas shopping a little bit earlier in Europe than would be the case here in the
United States.
So there's a seasonal element. And then as I've said also in the presentation, we got a little bit of a benefit in this quarter
from the finalizing of the – we're working towards finalizing our purchase price adjustment to the fair value that you
have to do on the acquisition of Alliance Boots, and we got a little bit of benefit there which helped the margin in this
quarter that we won't see when you come and look at the quarter – the same first quarter in 12 months' time. But the
key factor is the seasonality. And of course as we look towards the second quarter where we've got the very important
holiday trading, the December results and into early January, you'll also see the benefit of that coming through on the
next – when we're on the next call.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Got it. Okay. Thanks.

<Q - George R. Hill>: Hey. Good morning, guys, and I appreciate you taking the question. And I guess this one is
either for Alex or George. As we think about the Valeant deal, I guess can we talk about the economics of that deal, I'd
say, versus you guys and then using the regular wholesaling channel? And is this structure more economically
attractive for you and for them as we've heard a lot of the mid-size manufacturers scream a bit about the fees that are
paid to wholesalers? I'd appreciate any color.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi, George. It's Alex here. Yeah, again as I think we've said it's about taking friction and cost out
of the system. And for sure, we have an infrastructure here in the USA of the pharmacies, and of course in this deal
importantly, there will be independent pharmacies in this deal as well because we want to make sure that we give
customers proper access to the good products that Valeant has. And within that, we have the ability, therefore, to
distribute as well as fulfill the prescription, and that's what we intend to do in this occasion.
But as Stefano said before, every single partnership that we work with [indiscernible] (50:34) we look at how do we
create a win-win for our partner and what's important to them and how do we use our infrastructure, our assets, in
whatever country we operate in to make that so. So what we do here is we provide great care in a service model to our
pharmacies, to our pharmacists, to the patients. And then we distribute these drugs in this occasion as a fulfillment.
Each one will be different depending on the circumstances. And as Stefano said already, we will test this model
properly to make sure that it is appropriate and does work in the U.S.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. And then maybe the quick follow-up would be just to get on Rite Aid. Given that you
guys have gotten your second request, I guess anything in the conversations thus far that would indicate whether you
guys have any changes on store divestiture expectations? Synergy expectations seem to still be intact. But I guess as it
relates to divestitures, are you guys still thinking the number is less than 500?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We don't have any reason to change our view, as I have said. Or we are working with the
relevant authorities in order to speed up the process if possible of course. And for the time being, we cannot add any
comment to what we have said. We are still confident that this will go through in the terms that we have anticipated.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah, hi. Good morning, and congrats on a very good quarter. A couple of questions here.
The first one, if we think about the contract with Valeant, we can also think about it as a form of vertical partnership,
right, that helps reduce cost by removing kind of like the distributor from the equation. So when you think about
tightening relationships between you and manufacturers and kind of like bypassing the distributor, do you think that
this is something that theoretically can be extended to other manufacturers or this will be kind of like one-offs?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi, Ricky. Yeah, I think as George said before, many manufacturers are looking for more
efficient ways to get to the market to get their products to the customers and to the patients. So again, Valeant came
with that request to us, and other manufacturers may or may not come with that request to us and we'll look at each
case individually. So for sure it's really the same answer, I apologize, as we gave to George which is we have a great
infrastructure in the USA, we have a very strong logistics operation in the USA. We have good expertise and
wholesaling coming from [indiscernible] (53:34) division across the rest of the globe, particularly in Europe, and we
will always do our very best to take cost out of the system, to do a better job for customers and do a good job for our
partners. So we're open towards these opportunities but we've got to make sure that this one actually works and does
work in America and we'll take it from there.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then I have to say that the tone of this conference call is a lot more positive than
your last conference call. So have you seen something in the marketplace or internally that makes you feel better now

on the business trends than you were a few months ago?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: No. We were confident that – we have been confident for all the time we have been here. If we
had not been confident, we wouldn't have done this deal. We have done this deal we say not knowing that we were
going through a period of let's say substantial work that we – to really be able to exploit all the opportunities which
were there, which are here and which would be here, we have to do a certain work and this is what we are doing.
So maybe it's possible that sometimes we have more or less good in our presentations but this doesn't depend on our
mood. It depends maybe on our physical condition, I don't know, but not on our mood. Our mood has always been
positive. It's still positive and we still believe [indiscernible] (55:23) in what we are doing. If by any chance we
changed our mind, we would feel obliged to tell you but I can assure you we are as positive as we were one year ago.
<A - George Fairweather>: So you can take from that, Ricky, that I found a reasonable coffee shop with good pastries
this morning before the call.

<A - George Fairweather>: Absolutely.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the adjusted gross
margin in retail USA? It looks pretty good to me, 27.0%. That's actually up a bit sequentially. The year-over-year
compression of about 39 basis points that shows some improvement in the rate of compression relative to the past
couple of quarters. So, I mean, can you talk about the reimbursement that you're seeing in the Part D networks, also the
commercial plans and then what impact is generic inflation having on those margins? Thanks.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi, David. It's Alex here. I think the first thing I would say it really is as anticipated. So this is
really as we expected. Generic inflation, going to the last part of the question, for us is not material. So therefore, we're
feeling pretty good about this and this is factored into ongoing guidance going forward. The trends beyond that really
are the same trends. We have ongoing reimbursement pressure as we work with the market to lower costs. They are
more or less as we expected and the trend continues in the same fashion. It's something we're used to in Europe, as we
said before. I've worked in Europe for many, many years and it's a trend that we expect to see because as healthcare
expands and government pays more and patients pay more, then you've got to work to become more efficient within the
market and that's what we commit to doing.
And on the front end margins, we're pleased with the profitability as we continue to swap out all products. I mean as
George said in his introduction, we took out all of the older home decoration products which primarily sell in
November and we are replacing these with more giftables. But this was really the first year of that transition. We had
great support from some of the partners and we have more plans to shift that mix next Christmas. And also importantly,
we have [indiscernible] (58:09) the mix towards more beauty products, owned brand beauty products from Ken's
organization with the launch of these products in over [ph] 1,000 (58:18) extra stores to get to 2,000 stores by
somewhere around Christmas next year.
So the trends are very similar to be honest. We are pretty predictable. Maybe the one that was a bit less predictable was
promotional markets where, again, we [indiscernible] (58:33) through the autumn, so we've had to adjust that a little bit
[ph] after (58:38) that period, and of course, that's important to stay in the market and stay competitive which we are
doing. So really the trends are the same, we adjust as we go, but the fundamentals are the same.

<Q - David M. Larsen>: Would you expect this 27.0% gross margin to continue or improve for the rest of the year in
retail USA?
<A - George Fairweather>: As you'll appreciate, we don't give forecasts at that level. I'll really reiterate what Alex is
saying. We expect as we see in Europe, ongoing reimbursement pressures. There's obviously a little bit of growth in
specialties as well which I talked about which of course has got a high unit margin but lower percent. So there will be
some of these mix effects continuing to go through. And what we've got to continue to do is drive the efficiency and the
productivity, it's absolutely the way of life.
What we're really focused on if we come back is looking at the operating margin end to end and that's where Alex and I
are very focused. Coming back to the retail example, Alex just talked about, a lot of the promotional work that we
talked about created a lot of inefficiency in the...
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah.
<A - George Fairweather>: ...stores and a lot of costs, so what you've actually got to do is drive the efficiency out as
well as focusing just on the gross margin because what's important is to be able to grow our operating margin from the
business over time as well as our top line.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. And then just one more quick one, assuming the Rite Aid deal does close, I think what
I heard maybe last quarter was that you would expect the deal to be accretive in year one. Can you give any more color
around that? Like, what exactly does that term accretive mean? Would that be above and beyond, what the Rite Aid
earnings would normally layer in? Just any more color around that would be really helpful.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We have given you the level of synergies. We have said $1 billion of synergies. We still stand
behind that number. Of course, the synergies will be down day after day since the time we would be able to execute the
merger. You can really [indiscernible] (01:01:10) how much of these synergies will be possible in the first year. We
said that we would need two years or three years to deliver this $1 billion, so you can see. We have given an indication.
To be honest, we don't want to be more precise because we don't know exactly the term. We don't know exactly how
many pharmacies we will have to divest, we [ph] will (01:01:41) know exactly how many pharmacies we could
consolidate. So we don't want to be more precise for the time being but overall you have an indication.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. That's super. Very helpful. Thanks a lot, and congrats on a good quarter.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.
Please go ahead.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: I guess for anybody, but particularly Alex, there would seem to be – one of the ways that the
Rite Aid deal is going to work really well are the learnings that you can pick up from them. And obviously there's a lot
of potential there. Obviously, they do the loyalty card differently than you. They do the Wellness Ambassadors, the
Care Coaches. What are the one or two things that you kind of look at from afar and are intrigued by where there might
be some learnings that are particularly applicable to your store base?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, I think the first thing is that this company is managed with very limited resources for some
time and has done it very well, and I think that's a great discipline. It's a discipline, to be honest, the Walgreens team
has picked up really quickly in the last 12 months, 18 months. And I think [indiscernible] (01:02:57) organization to
use money wisely but again we have an opportunity, I think, to learn even more about that, given the level of cash that
Rite Aid didn't have in the last period. So that's the first one. I think related to that, secondly, to your point, they've
invested wisely in their best stores and they are getting – from the numbers that the team speak about and [ph] we will
(01:03:18) confirm they're getting nice lifts in their [ph] refitted (01:03:21) stores.

To be honest, as we review some of this stuff we did in the Well Experience, we hadn't been successful in the past of
maybe two years or three years ago with some of these lifts. We're now getting better lifts. And I guess, I think, if we
can put these lessons together, we can make better use of our capital and get better lifts in the front end. And, of course,
[indiscernible] (01:03:42) some really great products coming out of the global sourcing organization from Alliance
Boots [indiscernible] (01:03:48) into healthcare, into seasonal gifts. We put these three things together. So we are very
open. Partnership is about openness, curiosity to learn, and that team has done a good job in these two dimensions in
particular I think.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Do you have a view, again, from afar the Gold customer or Silver customer, the nature of that
loyalty program which is very, very unique relative to a lot of loyalty programs in the U.S. Is that something that's
particularly intriguing as something to give your effort a bit of a boost?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, we had [ph] to start a journey in (01:04:27) Walgreens. I mean the loyalty card here is
only three years old. We have 85 million active customers...
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Yep.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: ...on the card. We've now got almost 28 million, I think, [indiscernible] (01:04:37) Everyday
Points, which was only launched in May. So we're very curious about how that card works in the marketplace and we'll
certainly take our time to understand it and see what benefits it could bring to our partnership.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Sure. All right. And then maybe just for George. On the $1.5 billion cost reduction program,
have you seen – was there any benefit in the first quarter? Have you seen anything to-date? And then if you think about
how that breaks out 2016 and 2017, is that more back-end loaded or front-end loaded?
<A - George Fairweather>: We're just really working through the program, so every quarter we're getting more
benefit coming through. I think we said we were broadly at the halfway stage at the year-end and we're just working
methodically through it with Alex's team. We're pleased with the progress and very much on track to deliver this
program. Of course, once we're through this program, we will always seek new ways to drive further efficiencies. It's
just got to be a way of life for our business going forward. Just as we've done in the UK, just as we've done
successfully in Boots over a number of phases.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Yeah.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I had two and it goes to the Valeant deal that
was signed. Some of your PBM partners have been on the record saying that they thought the deal was kind of the
opposite of what you guys portrayed, that it increased costs to the system. So I wanted to ask you kind of why you
think their point of view is so different. And then the second question is, as you look at these partnerships, is Valeant
the – obviously, you thought it was the right partner. And I'm trying to – I guess, I would ask why. And then I had a
follow-up question on something else.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, hi. This is Alex here. Scott, yeah, again, we are determined to implement this well and
we're determined to be very transparent about what the real costs are as a result of this partnership. And I think we've
said in our statement that we have employed [indiscernible] (01:07:03) team to independently review this. So we are
working very closely not just with Valeant, but with our PBM partners to understand their concerns and we will take
care of these concerns. We're not looking to disrupt the system in terms of what they're trying to do to lower costs.
We're trying to take costs out of the systems which will help them to lower costs for their payers. That's our intention.
Of course, when you introduce something new to the market and some new thoughts, there's always people who maybe

think differently about it. But we are determined to implement this well and make it work.
And in terms of why Valeant, well, because of the fact that they came to us and they asked us [indiscernible] (01:07:46)
business in particular with the situation that we're in. We did appropriate due diligence and we decided that it's a good
opportunity to take some of the lessons that the team, particularly Ornella's team in Europe had learned about attractive
pharmacy [ph] more than (01:08:02) wholesale. So we saw the opportunity to lift and shift our best practice in Europe
into Valeant. And they liked the idea and they walked through it pretty quickly and got to a good place in a pretty short
period of time. They're a great team to work with, and we wish Mike a very speedy recovery. And the team themselves
are very engaged and working with us very well, and we will do all we can to make sure that any concerns are taken
care of and are independently [ph] reviewed (68:26).
<A - Stefano Pessina>: And Stefano here. Don't forget that they have accepted to reduce their prices and which is
really, I would say, quite exceptional, particularly here in the U.S. And they have accepted this because they have
understood that a new model which should cost less should deliver benefits to their customers, to their final patients.
And this is very important. And this shows that this need of new ways of working, the innovative way of working is
really understood. It's important that it is understood, and someone has to start. And we are very happy that we will be
able, I hope, to demonstrate how this model will work in the U.S. and how this model could reduce costs for the final
customers.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: [indiscernible] (01:09:44).
<A - Alex Gourlay>: [indiscernible] (01:09:46) but remember, we are both global companies. Valeant are a global
company. They operate in many markets that we operate in. We have great infrastructure across many markets, as
Stefano and George and others have explained. So we believe once we implement this well in the U.S., there are other
opportunities for us to work in a partnership with Valeant. And a 20-year deal was unusual but it was there because we
wanted to make sure that, over time, we generated a great platform not just here in the USA but also they're very good
quality products, to make them more available to their brands and maybe even some of their own brands possibly in the
European and other markets. So this is a much broader deal than just Europe. So to come back to why Valeant, there is
a second reason because they are a very good company with good expertise on a model which is a very, very efficient
R&D model.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: And also, as you know, we, at Boots, are very focused on skincare, and we have many
products in this area. We are market leader in this area, and Valeant has also many products and many patents and
intellectual properties in this area. And the collaboration could really improve the quality of our relevant products.
<A - Gerald Gradwell>: Okay. Brian, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Yes, sir. Our last question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Thank you. Two things, if I could. First of all, SG&A performance, SG&A dollars in the U.S. I
think grew in 4Q a little more than expected, and then improved in 1Q. Curious of the difference between that and how
we should think of that going forward. And then secondly, I think you said the retail margin was flat in the quarter in
the U.S. It seemed like you had done some things to improve profitability. Curious on the color there and how we think
about that line as we move forward.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Before I answer the two questions, I would like to attract your attention to what I have said at
the very beginning of this call. In reality, you don't have to measure us for the quarter taking all the different elements
of our company quarter by quarter. We have a long-term project. We are following this project independently on the
quarter, and so you will see sometimes better or worse KPIs and these will not be always same. You have to judge on
the whole and you'll see that on the whole we will continue to progress as we have clearly demonstrated in the last four
quarters, every quarter, we progress and it's a mix of everything we do.

The gross margin is important but at the end of the day what is really important is the operating margin, it is the earning
that we – the profit that we can extract from an operation. And sometimes you have to sacrifice that the gross profit
because the [ph] lower (01:13:28) increase in the gross profit or in the gross margin can be very expensive but to
achieve a [ph] level (01:13:36) costs or in other costs. So we have always a holistic view and this – our holistic view is
expanded over a long period of time and not over a quarter. Maybe you can answer in detail, but this is the logic, the
philosophy.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Maybe if I give a specific example in photographic [indiscernible] (01:13:57) the point that
Stefano is making. So, in photographic, we reduced substantially our operating costs by removing more expensive to
maintain, more difficult to use and requiring more people to use them wet labs, the old labs. We removed all of that
very quickly in a period of about 18 months across all of our states and replace them with a new digital technology,
which in essence reduces the gross margin actually because of the operating cost advantages of our system, drives two
things, drives volume. We had a very strong volume right through the period and as part of the flat sales as George –
about flat sales that George mentioned [indiscernible] (01:14:45) that was a driver of sales.
And also we have been able to offer better value to customers, and we're very pleased with the performance in that
category. We have really driven a big differential, and that's been also transported to Boots as well. Boots are using the
same platform with the same effect now in the UK. [indiscernible] (01:15:07) great example of what we mean by
operating margin, in terms of costs going forward, we remain confident in our cost plan. We're on track [indiscernible]
(01:15:16) people's attitude towards this has been fantastic, the teams have done a great job and customer care scores
are up because we're taking workload out. So going forward, you should expect to see the same activities.
[indiscernible] (01:15:29) quarter to quarter, as Stefano said, sometimes varies depending on a number of factors but
the strategy we're implementing is a very clear strategy and we're very pleased with the progress.
<A - George Fairweather>: I would just emphasize on top of that really that we're very disciplined in the way that we
look at returns, be it from capital, be it from revenue, revenue expenditure. And it's really back to what we said earlier,
we're very focused on creating real, real shareholder volume. So that means driving out cost inefficiencies as fast as we
possibly can in a way that still keeps the focus on the customer but equally we're [indiscernible] (01:16:07) willing to
invest, invest in either capital or invest in the revenue expenditure where we're confident we can get a good return, and
we will always do that. It will mean therefore from time to time, we will get the variations between the various
categories. The important thing is can you continue to drive up our overall returns and deliver a long-term sustained
shareholder value. And of course, there will always be seasonal variations. It's the nature of our business.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: [indiscernible] (01:16:39 – 01:16:50) And if you look at the publicly available information, it's
continued to a similar if not higher trend in the last few weeks as well. So again, seasonality is a big part of our
business, always has been, always will be. But one year we have a benefit maybe from seasonality, and one year we
have a less benefit from seasonality, so we feel very confident our strategy is working and we will feel very confident
through the quarter, as Stefano said, we will see that coming through.
