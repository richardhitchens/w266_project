MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is
being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please
stand by.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief
Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Jamie Dimon
Yeah, so this is Jamie and I'm going to start if you don't mind. I know some of you have many questions about my
recent cancer diagnosis, so I'd like to make a few comments on that, so that we can then hopefully focus on the reason
for our call, which is our quarterly earnings and the results of the company.
First, I want to thank everybody for their calls, their notes, their good wishes. It does mean a lot to me and my family.
To start with, I feel great. I think I have some of the best doctors in the world. I'll be receiving the best treatment and
I'm very fortunate that this is curable.
To recap, we've already talked about and what my doctors have told me about, we caught it early. It's confined to the
original site in the adjacent lymph nodes in the right side of my neck; it's isolated to that specific area; the cancer has

not spread. Importantly, with all the tests they've done, there's no evidence of cancer anywhere else in my body and it's
curable with radiation and chemotherapy, which I would put down as fairly standard for this kind of cancer, and the
prognosis is excellent.
The board will be fully briefed on my condition and if they and I feel that it's necessary to make additional disclosures,
we will do that. But I really do think the next disclosure I'm going to make will be in about seven or eight weeks,
saying the therapy is over, I'm feeling better and the prognosis is excellent.
My doctors have finalized their treatment plans with me over the last several days. Though I do plan as I go through the
treatment to be actively involved in managing our business, I've also been told that after the seven-week treatment
period, I've been advised to take rest. That does not mean I won't work. They just simply say that rest and recuperation
should come before other things. Which, by the way, is the exact same advice I'd give my friends, my family and
anyone who works at JPMorgan or anyone of you who came down with something like this. So I do plan to work. I do
plan to read. I will be accessible.
Succession planning, that's why it's here, is exactly as it was before. There's no change whatsoever. The board has plans
in place and they talk about it all the time for various scenarios and we are fortunate enough to have an exceptional
group of executives. You know them all. I hope you take the time to tell some of the reporters their quality. I always
tell people, there's a book on everybody. And the book on a lot of the management team here is brains, ethics, work
ethic, partnering, knowledge, experience, high-quality people – and I actually think that many of them could run a
major financial company and my board feels the same way. And importantly, the board has been fully engaged with the
senior leaders the whole time they've been at this company.
I also want to point out that we have a standing protocol in place. Before this, during this and after this, we think it's
simply good governance that if I am unreachable for any reason, remember I just took a three-week trip to Asia, so if
it's for a minute, an hour, a day or a week, that they are to contact our lead director who will get them the consent, the
advice and the help that they need so that the company continue to go on as usual.
And so I will stop there and hand it off to Marianne who will take you through the earnings of the company.
Marianne Lake
Okay. Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is
available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the
presentation.
Starting now on page one, the firm delivered strong performance this quarter with net income of $6 billion on revenue
of over $25 billion; EPS of $1.46 and a return on tangible common equity of over 14%. The reported results, as you can
see on the page, includes approximately $670 million of firmwide legal expense. In addition to that item, there were a
number of other smaller items, some positive, some negative, in the results; most notably, $350 million of consumer
reserve releases. And we estimate our core performance for the quarter was also $6 billion plus or minus, which is
among the best we've ever had; which is a very good result, especially given the challenging environment for markets
and mortgage, which persisted during the second quarter and interest rates remaining low and the cost of control high.
Importantly, in the firm's performance this quarter, we are really seeing the benefit of our diversified earnings profile,
as well as the focus on investing and growing the underlying performance drivers in each of our businesses, which has
translated into net income growth and operating leverage in a number of businesses, most notably CBB, commercial
banking and asset management.
We also continue to make significant progress against our capital targets, with a CET1 ratio of 9.8%; firmwide and
bank supplementary leverage ratios of 5.4% and 5.6% respectively and remaining compliant with liquidity
requirements; all while returning $3 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter with gross share repurchases of $1.5
billion. Core loan growth was strong for the quarter at 4% and 8% up year-on-year with encouraging signs across our
businesses and NII was up slightly this quarter on a relatively flat core NIM.

Turning to page two, before getting into each of the businesses, a couple of comments here; you can see circled the
adjusted expense for the quarter was $14.8 billion for an adjusted overhead ratio of 58%. This number does obviously
exclude legal expense, but of note, it includes a little less than $300 million of expenses related to business
simplification, which we consider to be non-core.
Including lower incentive compensation on lower CIB revenues for the first half, we have updated our adjusted full
year expense guidance to be $58 billion plus or minus, with the caveat that obviously the final number will depend on
performance-related compensation for the full year. We continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses and
operating as efficiently as possible across our businesses. You can also see on the page the returns generated this
quarter by each of our businesses, which is driving the strong performance of the firm overall.
Moving on to page three. As I said, the firm reported a CET1 ratio of 9.8%, up from 9.6% last quarter as we increased
our Common Equity Tier 1 capital base by over $4 billion, principally through net retained earnings. Risk-weighted
assets were broadly flat in the quarter, with higher operational risk RWA and some growth, largely offset by lower
market and credit risk RWA, reflecting increased model usage and portfolio runoff. We are still on track to reach
10%-plus CET1 ratio by the end of the year as previously guided.
The lower of our two transitional measures, and you'll recall, we exited Basel III parallel at the beginning of the
quarter, so the lower of our two transitional measures which is technically the measure effective this quarter under the
common floor is the Basel III advanced transitional ratio, which is also at 9.8%. And what isn't on the page but for your
information, the fully phased-in standardized ratio is 10.1%.
We continue to make good progress on our leverage ratios this quarter both the firm and the bank SLR improved
quarter over quarter by about 30 basis points, so we are obviously within sight of our 5.5% target for the firm; and at
5.6% for the bank, we do have a clear path to our 6%-plus target. Finally, on this page, we continue to have a very
strong liquidity position remaining compliant with LCR.
Moving on to the businesses, starting on page four, Consumer & Community Banking. The combined consumer
businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.4 billion of revenue and an ROE of 19%. We
continue to see excellent growth in the underlying business drivers with average deposits up 9% in CBB; our active
mobile customers up 23%; credit card sales volume up 12%; client investment assets up 19% and crossing the $200
billion mark; and according to J.D. Power, we continue to be ranked number one in overall customer satisfaction, as
well as for mortgage originations among large banks; and number one in three of four regions for small business
banking customer satisfaction. Finally, across CCB, we expect to exceed our head count reductions outlined at Investor
Day.
Turning to page five, Consumer & Business Banking. CBB generated net income of $894 million, up a significant 28%
year-on-year on net revenue of $4.6 billion with an ROE of 33%. While we do continue to see some pressure on
deposit margins, this continues to be more than offset by strong growth in deposit balances, the 9% I just mentioned,
among the highest in the industry. This deposit growth is driven by strong household growth and record customer
retention. We added 800,000 net households since last year, as our new branches continue to mature.
On the non-interest revenue side, we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in both debit and investment
revenues, as we deepen relationships with customers and as we see our global wealth management strategy play out
with more affluent customers.
In Business Banking, the momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued. We have record originations, up 46%
year-on-year and 27% over last quarter, back to levels that we last saw in 2012. We believe that this reflects a
combination of improving industry trends, driven by business optimism generally continuing to trend higher and
improving banker performance, especially in our expansion markets where we've been investing and as our targeted
strategies mature.
Our pipeline continues to strengthen, 2Q 2014 was the highest level since 2012. And we do expect this positive
momentum and strong growth year-over-year to continue in the second half of the year. Expense was flat year-on-year,

with efficiency gains in the branches being offset by higher cost of controls that we've spoken about, but it was down
quarter-on-quarter as cost of investments in controls are moderating.
Turning to page six and Mortgage Banking. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $700 million for the quarter
with an ROE of 16%. As expected, the production environment remains challenging and mortgage production pre-tax
income, excluding repurchase, was a negative $74 million for the quarter, a little better than our guidance, reflecting
higher revenue margins on a mix shift towards retail loans and higher pipeline, as well as good progress made in the
quarter to reduce our fixed expenses. At this point, market dependent, we expect the third quarter results to be broadly
similar to the second quarter, a small negative.
Originations of $17 billion were flat quarter-on-quarter and down 66% year-on-year, which is in a market that we
estimate was seasonally up 25% quarter-on-quarter, which shows that we continue to lose some share. Key drivers
behind the share loss were the continuation of our strategy to reduce our participation in lower FICO and higher LTV
government loans, as well as the burnout of HARP. In addition, we did lose some share in other conventional, resulting
from price competition as we maintained discipline regarding pricing to our required returns.
Mortgage production benefited in the quarter from a repurchase reserve release, a positive $137 million driven
primarily by refinement in expectations regarding certain residual risks following the settlement in the fourth quarter of
2013.
Onto servicing; net servicing-related revenue of $693 million is down slightly quarter-on-quarter, but it's higher than
guidance due primarily to higher gains on XIO securities and Ginnie Mae loan sales. While we do expect to continue to
benefit from both during the second half of the year, to a lesser extent than the first and these gains can be lumpy. So
we expect servicing revenue to decline in the third quarter to $600 million plus or minus and servicing expenses were
modestly down quarter-on-quarter.
MSR risk management was a net gain this quarter of $338 million, driven by a $220 million positive model update on
slower prepayment speeds, which remember, we would have earned otherwise over time through model miss and
which reflects the impact of the burnout on HARP-eligible loans I mentioned.
On Real Estate Portfolios, concentrating on credit, we see net charge-offs for the quarter of $111 million and reserve
releases of $300 million in the purchased credit-impaired portfolio, reflecting actual and expected appreciation in home
prices. There were no reserve releases in the quarter for the non-credit-impaired portfolio, although favorable loss and
delinquency trends do continue. We do expect to see reserve releases in NCI over the next couple of years, in total
between $500 million and $1 billion, as the credit quality of the portfolio continues to improve. And lastly on Real
Estate Portfolios, in the quarter, we added $5 billion of loans to the portfolio.
Finally, mortgage head count was down approximately 5,000 year-to-date and we expect to exceed our Investor Day
target of approximately 6,000 for the full year of 2014.
Turning to page seven, Card, Merchant Services & Auto: net income of $840 million, down 33% year-on-year or down
11% excluding reserve releases, delivering an ROE of 18%. While down on declining reserve releases, the results do
reflect strong underlying metrics. Sales growth of 12% led the industry for the 25th consecutive quarter, primarily due
to strong sales engagement of new customers. Our new acquisition vintages are performing exceptionally well.
In Merchant Services, we've seen strong volume and transaction growth year-over-year with our signed sales volume
gaining momentum, reflecting several large account wins in the quarter. Strong revenue of $4.6 billion was up slightly
quarter-on-quarter, but down 3% year-on-year, and when you think about the year-on-year decline, we've reached the
point where spread compression and strong fee growth offset. So the net decline is driven by higher amortization of
customer acquisition costs and the absence of fees related to discontinued products in 2013.
Expenses up 8% quarter-on-quarter and 7% year-on-year driven by controls, the timing of marketing investments and
this quarter includes $125 million of the legal expense I talked about.
Moving on to Credit, losses continue to improve, albeit at a slower pace and the card net charge-off rate has remained
very low at 288 basis points and we released $50 million of student lending reserves in the quarter. Card outstandings

momentum has shifted. End-of-period outstandings grew by $1.8 billion or 1.5% year-over-year with growth coming
across our product set, fueled by the strong sales performance I highlighted. Core growth is now outpacing runoff and
we acquired over 2 million new accounts in the quarter, up 40% year-on-year.
Before we move on, a few words on Auto: new vehicle sales continue to grow year-on-year and that June saw results
reach the highest level since 2006. We've seen the 11th straight quarter of loan and lease growth as our partners
continue to outpace the general market, which remains competitive. The Auto pipeline remains healthy, consistent with
the recovery in the auto market.
Moving on to slide eight and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $9
billion and an ROE of 13%. In banking, total revenue was $3.1 billion down 2% year-on-year; IB fees, $1.8 billion, up
3%. We maintained our number one ranking in global IB fees, per Dealogic and widened the gap to number two.
Revenue growth was driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees and while debt underwriting fees were
lower we had strong relative performance for the quarter. The IB pipeline remains solid, with an environment
supportive of M&A and a large, diversified IPO backlog.
Treasury Services revenue of $1 billion was in line with our guidance, down 4% year-on-year, driven by lower trade
finance revenue and the impact of business simplification. And lending revenue was down $80 million year-on-year,
driven by lower NII, so it was up 5% quarter-on-quarter.
Moving on to Markets & Investor Services, reported markets revenue was down 14% year-on-year versus our guidance
of 20% plus or minus, with FICC down 15% and equities revenue down 10%. Included in these results are gains of
over $100 million on the sale of Markit Partners shares post IPO. Excluding this, our results would've been down 15%
year-on-year. In FICC, the decline was driven broadly across macro products and in commodities, with volatility
remaining very low and with the exception of a few more active weeks in June, volume also low. In equities, the
decline was driven by derivatives, where client volumes are highly correlated to volatility levels.
In terms of outlook for the coming quarter and the second half, June was a better month, somewhat broadly, but that
momentum has not continued into July so far and volatility remains very low across products. As such, it is our central
case that the third quarter will face a similar environment to the first half of 2014 and we expect normal seasonal
trends. Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher NII on higher
deposits and higher asset-based fees on higher assets under custody; AUC reached a record $21.7 trillion, up 14%
year-on-year. Quarter-on-quarter, revenue was up on seasonality in the depositary receipt and agent lending businesses.
Moving on to expense, total expense was up 6% year-on-year. Compensation expense was down 8%, with a comp to
revenue ratio for the quarter of 31% and we expect the full year comp to revenue ratio to likely end between 30% and
35%, rather than at the low end of the range. Non-compensation expense was up year-on-year by 20%, with the quarter
including over $300 million of legal expense and a little less than $300 million of non-core expenses associated with
business simplification I mentioned earlier.
Moving on to page nine and the Commercial Bank. We had very good earnings in the Commercial Bank this quarter,
with net income up 6% from last year and an ROE of 19%. We saw strong performance on key underlying business
drivers, driving revenue of $1.7 billion up 3% sequentially with gross IB fees up 25% year-on-year, driving the first
half of the year to a record and on a higher NII driven by higher loan volumes and day count.
We added $3.3 billion of loans in the quarter, with growth across the board in all of our businesses. Our consistent
growth in real estate continued, with loans up 2% in the quarter and 14% in the year. And after a flat start to the year,
we're happy to see C&I growth of 3% in the quarter, in line with the industry. Revolver utilization picked up 3
percentage points versus the end of last year. Pipelines are up, which should be supportive for trends in the second half
of the year.
The environment remains competitive but stable, driving some continued spread compression and we continue to see
some pricing pressure to varying degrees in the businesses. Expenses relatively flat quarter-on-quarter, but higher than
last year, reflecting our commitment to the regulatory and control agenda. Expect expenses for the business of

approximately $700 million in the third quarter. And our credit performance remains exceptional with net recoveries in
the quarter.
Moving on to page 10 and Asset Management. An excellent quarter in Asset Management, with net income of $552
million, up 10% year-on-year and 25% quarter-on-quarter, with a 25% ROE and a 30% pre-tax margin hitting our
through-the-cycle targets. For the full-year, these ratios will be slightly lower as the business continues to invest in both
infrastructure and control, as well as select front-office hiring. But we are on track to deliver at our through-the-cycle
target for the full-year of 2015.
Revenue of $3 billion was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting an increase in management fees driven by record long-term
net inflows of $34 billion for the quarter, including the benefit of a large institutional fixed income mandate. This
marks the 21st consecutive quarter of long-term inflows, driving AUM of $1.7 trillion up 16% year-on-year and we
continue to expect strong flows going forward.
Looking at the mix of flows by product, we saw continued strength in our multi-asset and alternative flows in line with
our best quarter. In fixed income, we had our strongest quarter of flows ever and our best quarter in over a year,
excluding the large mandate I mentioned. And lastly, despite solid equity market performance in the quarter, flows did
not follow as investors showed hesitance to add to their positions at these levels.
Expense of $2.1 billion was up 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher cost of controls and investment in
growth. Lastly in banking, we reported solid performance in both lending and deposits. Record loan balances surpassed
the $100 billion mark, up 17% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter with growth coming from both our U.S. and our
international markets. We continue to see a solid pipeline for loan demand for the remainder of the year and the
average deposits were also up year-on-year by 8% but seasonally down 1% sequentially.
Moving on to page 11 and Corporate/Private Equity. Private equity overall had a flattish result, driven by net gains on
dispositions, partially offset by unrealized losses. And our private equity portfolio declined by approximately $1
billion.
Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $46 million, NII was a negative $10 million, better by $80 million
quarter-on-quarter, driven by higher investment securities balances and the continued benefit of higher reinvestment
yields. In the quarter, we deployed $27 billion in gross new investments.
Finally on this page, Other Corporate. Net income was over $400 million. Included in the results are tax-related
benefits of over $200 million. And as I mentioned earlier, we reported firmwide legal expense pre-tax of $670 million
for the quarter, of which $227 million is here in Other Corporate.
Moving on to outlook on page 12. We did receive positive feedback from our most recent guidance disclosure in the
10-Q, so we've replicated it and updated it here. A few final comments: it is too early for us to give specific guidance
on markets revenues, but we do expect the current environment to persist into the third quarter and for the second half
and also to experience normal seasonal trends.
For the third quarter, we generally expect Mortgage Production to be similar to this quarter, a small negative. We
expect firmwide adjusted expenses for the full year of $58 billion plus or minus and expect credit trends to continue to
be very strong across the board with consumer reserve releases that will be more periodic and modest.
So to wrap up, a very, very strong result for the quarter notwithstanding headwinds, reflecting the strength of each of
our businesses and the benefit of our operating model.
With that, operator, we would like to open up the line for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. One moment.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: ...that you've shared in the past, if you have a parallel shift of 100 basis points what that will
do to your net interest revenue?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, Gerard, you got cut off at the beginning. But you're asking for our earnings at risk on a 100
basis point shift?
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: That's correct.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It was in the first quarter. We haven't disclosed it yet for the second quarter, but it wouldn't be
meaningfully different. In the first quarter it was $2.5 billion.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Do you see, going forward, that changing in the way you are approaching your interest
sensitivity as the likelihood of rising interest rates increases in 2015? Or should it remain pretty much constant?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, I mean, obviously, earnings at risk is a representation, it's an instantaneous parallel shift. If
you look actually at our disclosures, you can also see what a steepener looks like. So the way I would characterize the
way to think about the impact of our asset sensitivity and interest rates rising is the way we described it both at Investor
Day and at the Morgan Stanley Conference, which is when rates rise, whenever that starts, which may be in the second
half of 2015 at the short end and the long end continues, that over time, that will deliver $8 billion to $10 billion of NII
for the firm. But clearly, the path to get there will be rate-dependent and timing.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Tying in to the higher interest rates, you've been vocal about your funding side of the
equation and what you expect there. Can you give us an update or more color of how you're positioned for the funding
side of the balance sheet should rates rise? How much you expect to potentially maybe move off your balance sheet as
it gets repriced into different types of products?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: This is Jamie. I think on the funding side, we said we've met pretty much LCR, NSFS (sic)
[NSFR] (28:45) and we think would be the GLAC or at least we're very close to it. That's all embedded interest rate
exposure, which Marianne gave you. And that's our base case. Obviously, if the world changes, we may change how
we go about and do that, but I think it's a very good base case to look at. We don't have any need to change it
dramatically. You all have to be prepared for the reason that rates raise obviously will change why people act a certain
way.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: My final question is there's been some talk about the regulators, the Federal Reserve maybe
increasing the capital ratios for the largest banks to even higher levels than what you're mandated today to carry. Do
you guys have any thoughts on whether that may actually ever get through, that they may even raise the current Tier 1
Common Ratio numbers?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think we'd have to wait and see. Remember, the United States has already gone beyond most
other countries and they may just be referring to that, that they intend to keep that or how they modify that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And I think, the way that we think about it, obviously, we don't know how things may change
in the future, but between the G-SIB surcharge, the buffers that we and other institutions are going to run above that,
with LCR, NSFR, our own internal liquidity framework, with capital stress testing under CCAR, under extremely
severe conditions, it feels like we have a box around this and so we are planning to run the firm based upon what we
know today, with an eye on obviously listening to all of the things you hear.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Great. And, Jamie, good luck on your treatment and I hope for a speedy recovery. Thank
you.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Thank you very much.

Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. Jamie, just let me say it's nice to hear you on the call and that you're
sounding good and that the prognosis sounds great and I wish you all the best.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Thank you.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Just to follow up on the interest rate point for a second, I know you guys been very focused
on the potential for a deposit drain as things are handled somewhat differently by the Fed, given the current
circumstances when they eventually do raise rates. Is there any change in that thinking of the potential for a trillion-ish
deposit drain and maybe $100 billion for yourselves on the basis of the Fed minutes from last week which maybe were
a little contradictory in terms of the mechanics, that Peterson Institute article which has been, I think, seminal in
everyone's thinking.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So keep in mind, if the Fed, whether they use repo or just sell securities, that will reduce
deposits, ipso facto, it's an absolute formula. The question is whose deposits, what kind of deposits and when they
might do something like that. I assume they'll be fairly careful. I think what we simply were saying is that, some of the
deposits will come out of non-operating wholesale deposits, already have HQLA, some won't. Some will come out of
retail. And just people need to be prepared for it. I wouldn't put it in the earth-shattering category, just people need to
be prepared and be very thoughtful about how we go about that.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And given where you are on LCR, do you feel like JPMorgan is completely positioned as it
will want to be at that time? Or is that still just a build that's going to take place in liquidity between now and a year
from now or so?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think we're very comfortable with where we are.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah and remember, we are running – LCR is an important measure, it's a regulatory measure,
we're measuring it, we're reporting it, but we run the firm based upon our own internal liquidity stress framework and
we're comfortable with that.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great. The other thing that I'd like to touch on is the expense guidance. Obviously, it's ticked
down somewhat again and that's probably partly because of the revenue outlook that we're looking at for this year, but
is there anything implicit in that in terms of what we should expect for expenses beyond 2014? And then maybe you
can elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about core expense reductions, given a consistently pretty sticky
revenue environment.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Really, what I would point you to is the discussions that we had, largely at Investor Day,
which was to say that we continue to expect the mortgage expense story to play out over the course of the next few
years, which will be obviously a tailwind for us on expenses, both in servicing, but most particularly in production. So
that is obviously a focus in 2015 and beyond. We also are expecting to start on a journey to delivering, you saw that our
CBB expenses, the cost of control investment are moderating and Gordon outlined at Investor Day that the CBB
business 2014 through 2016, as a relative matter, would deliver approximately $1 billion of expense efficiencies, but
the profile of that we haven't been through.
And then Daniel is working through, as are all of the other CEOs, the expense story in the CIB and being as diligent as
you would expect him to be given the environment, but one of our positions has always been that we are running this
business for the longer-term and we're going to be smart about the actions we take on expenses in order to make sure
that we protect the franchise, but that doesn't mean that we can't and won't be more efficient across the businesses. So
we haven't actually given specific guidance at the firm-wide level but that's the backdrop.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And so I just want to reiterate that we always talk about waste cutting, like real estate, people,
straight-through processing, vendors things we think we got a little sloppy, where we're relocated but we will never
ever, ever stop investing in straight-through processing, better bankers, better training, ChaseNet, marketing, Sapphire,
EBK is the new stuff for branches. So don't confuse the two.

We're lumping them together for you. Internally, no one goes to a budget meeting and says, I get my expenses down by
cutting expenses and the really important things we need for the future. No one. We're not going to run the company
that way. We'd rather earn less money.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one final one?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Included in that is paying our people fairly.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: That's obviously important. One last one for me, there have been quite a few areas where you
have pulled back in order to ensure the ability to monitor and be in compliance, third-party mortgage origination was
one, trade finance and correspondent banking internationally, another one. Is all of the foreseeable pullback in areas of
business for control reasons pretty much known now or are there other things that we should expect that you might be
looking at?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would say that it's a matter of good housekeeping that would be constantly looking at
making sure that we are simplifying our businesses where it makes sense to do it. But as a large matter, as a macro
matter, we are working through the things that we talked about, some of the things that you mentioned and there are no
significant changes.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's great. Thanks so much.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We've got 1,000 correspondent banks. We sold CWT. We might very well – we sold RPS. There
were bunch of product lines we've either closed down or eliminated. And a lot of that is in the works. We put a light
enhanced monitoring on our other businesses and so we're well along the way, but if something comes up that we think
we should look at again, we'll look at it again.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Actually, let me just follow up on that then to make sure that we don't over-model
revenues. Are there still meaningful incremental revenue declines that we should expect from all of those areas that
have been discontinued?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The most significant revenue effect that is not yet in our run rate because the transaction is not
yet closed is the exit of the Physical Commodities business. So obviously when that closes, which may be in the early
part of the fourth quarter, that would have an impact in the revenues both in the quarter and then in our run rate in 2015.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And we gave you a number at Investor Day. We should probably go update that number.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Well, I can give you the numbers now. So at Investor Day, we said that the impact in 2014 on
revenues would be a decline of $1.6 billion, just given the timing of the Physical Commodities deal, the impact in 2014
is going to be closer to $1.2 billion of which about $500 million is in our run rate already.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Is our CWT in there, too?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. And then when you annualize the things that will be complete by the end of the year,
that's 85% of everything that's ultimately going to get done. So once we close the year, this year the impact this year
will be $1.2 billion. The annualized impact that we gave was $2.8 billion and that's still our best estimate.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And the important thing is the four beautiful franchises; Asset Management, Commercial Bank,
CIB, CCB are all doing really, really well and this doesn't affect their ability to serve their clients at all.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And remember also just for the purposes of completeness, it would be remiss of me not to say
that expenses are also coming out as we take those revenues out and that remember, these are in large part businesses
that were not at this time accretive to the overall firm's return. So, important to remember that.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great. Thanks for the completeness of the answer.

Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi, there.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello there. So we've seen a greater number of sales in the repo market. It seems to me just an
issue of available collateral, but I'm curious to get your take on how much we're supposed to care on it and whether or
not some of the actions by Treasury, in the reverse repo market, can take care of that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think because the Treasury – the government is still buying a big portion of net Treasury
issuance and because they are doing going to the repo market and taking cash out of the system, I think that number has
maybe gone from $100 billion to $200 billion over time. Remember I believe that, that repo can't be re-hypothecated.
So I do think some of the things that causes some issues in the repo market, my guess is that will sort through over
time. We do believe we've seen dealers reducing their books in repo and you've had a lot of statements about repo and
collateral and capital against it, so I still think that's going to sort out over time.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Good. It sounds like you're not losing too much sleep over it.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Not yet.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Marianne, you mentioned a comment when you were talking about C&I loan growth, I just
wanted to get a clarification. Last quarter, if I remember correctly it was about flattish on the year-on-year basis and
you spoke about price competition and some discipline on JPMorgan's part. This quarter, you have a little bit more
year-on-year growth, still mentioned the comment about discipline, but I just wanted to get a clarifying statement. Is
just growth a little bit better, is the backdrop a little bit better and you expect to participate in that a little bit more?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So I would say that there hasn't been a step – shift in sentiment, but sentiment is better it
feels better year-over-year and better quarter-over-quarter. It has allowed us to deliver growth in line with the industry
and we do, however, maintain, absolutely maintain our sort of credit risk discipline as it relates to the commercial
space. So it is competitive. It hasn't been the case that we've historically been losing on price, it has been more on credit
discipline and on simplification and de risking, but...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think Marianne mentioned it, but in almost every category of C&I – I'm talking about the
commercial bank – utilization was up like 1% last quarter. Maybe even...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Utilization in commercial was up 3% since the end of the year.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Since the end of the year. And utilization is usually a pretty good measure of companies starting
to expand and early on, it's receivables and inventory. You haven't really seen it in capital expenditures yet. And if you
look at U.S. capital expenditures in total including big businesses, they're kind of flat to down. That will ultimately be
the driver of real growth. So if you start to see that, you're going to hopefully see a stronger economy but utilization I
think is the first sign.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I appreciate that. Last one is I just couldn't help notice the balance sheet is now at $2.5
trillion. In your discussions, I know we can't purchase our way through without jumping through a lot of hurdles but do
you feel constrained on just sheer balance sheet size? And the reason I ask is I look across most of your franchises,
they're growing, they're growing nice and they're growing organically through the investments you've made. I just want
to know if anybody is bringing up the issue of just absolute size?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No. But can I just give you a number – I think year-over-year that balance sheet is up mostly
because of money we have at the Fed.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Even quarter-over-quarter.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Even quarter-over-quarter, we have $350 billion or almost $400 billion at central banks around
the world, we have an investment portfolio of $350 billion. We have a loan portfolio of $700 billion. We've already

told you when they start to reverse QE3, some of those will automatically come down. So our balance sheet is kind of
high because of all this huge liquidity and securities in the balance sheet and eventually hopefully that will be more
loans which are more productive and less just holding excess cash.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Eventually, maybe a little capital return, too.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And just to illustrate the point, if you're looking at the slides, you're looking end-of-period
assets that grew by $40 billion or so. If you look at the average, it was only $18 billion. We get a lot of volatility around
the cash movement at quarter-end. So Jamie is right, there has been a significant amount of our growth that has been
deposits and ultimately found its way on deposit with the central bank.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Great. I appreciate the answers. Thanks.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I would say against that, having said that, of course, we are – there's a natural healthy tension
now with leverage rules that we are clearly strategically optimizing the way we use our balance sheet and that will just
have a natural tension to keep the balance sheet growth, if there is growth, to be more modest.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And you've also seen, we were talking about G-SIFI, the big Chinese banks, the big Japanese
banks and some other banks around the world growing fairly rapidly. Hopefully, we'll eventually reduce our G-SIFI
scores a little bit too.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And if we're right about the liquidity drain in QE, you'll see a bunch of deposits flow out
potentially in the second half of next year and see some of that growth reverse.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Right.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: All right. Okay. Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: A couple of questions, one on FICC, one on expenses and one on RWAs. Just on the FICC
line, you mentioned that it was a little bit better in the last part of June and then you went on to say that the outlook is
for current environment to persist. So I just wanted to ask a little bit about which environment you're speaking about,
just the overall quarter? Because the quarter ends up being a little bit better than expected right in the mid-part of the
quarter. Are you suggesting that the end of June activity is likely to keep a positive tone to what you're expecting in
third quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thanks for the question because I want to make sure I'm very clear. So, in June, we did see an
uptick in activity in terms of client activity but volatility stayed very, very low and there was no specific catalyst for it,
no catalyst that would lead us to believe that that would necessarily continue and as we have moved into July it so far
has been our experience that it has not continued at that level.
So it is more – our guidance in the second half is that the 15% to 20% – the 20% plus or minus decrease that we've seen
in the first half, that kind of environment is the one that we're facing over the second half. Now we're not guiding to a
number because as you very well know, it's however many trading days into the quarter and things can change. So
you're going to have to pick your level and we can't predict it any better than that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's not a forecast. It's just our operating assumption is that it will stay at low levels for a while.
We know we're going to be wrong in that, but you will all have to pick whatever you think.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure. Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We run the company planning for low and hoping for better.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And that's 15% year-on-year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I'm sorry?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: That's 15% plus or minus down year-on-year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Well, we're not giving a specific guidance. It was 20% in the first quarter, 15% in the second,
that kind of environment.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And third and fourth are generally lower and it could be lower than last year...
<A - Marianne Lake>: With normal seasonality.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then on the expenses, you've outlined a couple of different areas that you're
working on to get the expenses down. The question is on why in the IB you've got the repositioning cost called out
specifically because I'm just kind of thinking out loud that you've got to invest to get expense saves in a broad set of
areas of the business, so why call it out in the IB? Does it suggest that we'll see more repo cost coming through in other
areas over the next several quarters as people roll out their expense plans?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right. So we called out the $300 million if that's what you're referring to in the CIB because in
our view anyway it is a modestly sized and nonrecurring item. We are not expecting to have similar items like that. We
may have some but certainly not our forecast that were going to have that kind of level recurring.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And the other...
<A - Marianne Lake>: So it's really just to give you a sense that in the quarter we absorbed that number. Choose what
you will to do with in terms of your models but we don't consider that to be core.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. But in the other areas where you are also working on expense programs you don't
expect that you're going to have any of those kind of one-time repo items, repositioning items?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Not at this time, not significant.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. All right. And then on the RWAs, you indicated that RWAs were up a little bit on op
risk, down on market and credit risk?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And then you went on to say that it was model related. Is that all your internal models? Is
that based on consultation with regulators? I'm just wondering why the Op Risk would have gone up for you given that
you had your big settlement a couple of quarters ago.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. So first of all, these are all the moving parts. None of them are materially significant so
operational risk went up a little bit, growth went up a little bit and offset against that we continue to always onboard
positions on to approved models, continue to develop our models, and get approvals for our models so that we can have
the most efficient RWA that we can have and so we saw some of that and also portfolio runoff. So we were just giving
you some color that flat RWA is actually the continuation of the work that we articulated at Investor Day that will
ultimately drive it down to be closer to $1.5 trillion over the next 18 months.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're a little inconsistent. We're upfronting all the negatives fully phased in. We're not
upfronting model approvals we expect to get.

to be approved by regulators.

CDOs back in the day. Does that impact how you're thinking about the op risk charges?

Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, Marianne. Following up on loan growth commentary, net interest income dollars
seemed a little better than you expected at the $11 billion. Are you still looking for that to be flattish kind of top of the
house NII for this year or is the outlook a little better given the loan growth trends?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we said relatively flat. It came up slightly in the quarter. Obviously, we're pleased with that.
And we told you that we expected core growth for the year to be 5% plus or minus and at this point that would still be
our best assessment. If loan growth does continue to improve and improves to the point where our core loan growth is
above 5%, then yes we would hope to enjoy the NII benefit. But as we look forward based upon current rates, broadly
flat with a little bit of upward bias is our outlook until rates start to rise.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then in terms of share buybacks...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Sorry, John. Because you do continue to have albeit that it's everything is a little bit less than it
was, but you do continue to have offsets against that in terms of spread compression.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So, yes with the 5% core loan growth do you expect NII to be relatively flat
this year and flat to up a little bit next year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. If the market-implied curve is, in fact, how things play out.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then on share buybacks, could you give us some thoughts about how
you're thinking about using your buyback approval for this year? Did you accelerate some of the buyback activity on
price weakness this quarter? And do you expect to do more in the second half because the RWA reductions are starting
to happen?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So first of all, obviously what we can do is guided and limited by what we have approval to do
but, yes, we did articulate that we were going to likely backend our share repurchases as we built towards our CET-1
ratio. You can obviously see we built towards that nicely at 9.8%. And then, yes obviously particularly in the first half
of the quarter our price was favorable and we did share repurchases reflecting all of those things.

When we look at the next, the second half, without giving specifics because we don't give guidance on repurchases, we
have the capacity to do $5 billion more growth over the next three quarters and we have a target to hit above 10% and
we will juggle those two things together but that gives us the capacity to continue to do some repurchases.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. That's helpful thanks. And on the mortgage servicing revenues, the outlook that
you gave for the $600 million roughly, does that include any MSR risk management gains? Or do you assume none in
that? Could you just clarify that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We assume none in that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Think about the MSR risk management – as we generally speaking, expect our results to be
close to home, so plus or minus zero outside of any model updates because of our hedging strategy.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And last question on legal costs. This quarter, they are mostly in the IB and
Corporate. Any commentary on what type of issues you're currently accruing for? And also, could you clarify whether
you have any remaining outstanding material mortgage litigation, or is that mostly settled from the mortgage area?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So as much as I know you want to hear it, we're not going to be able to talk about the specifics
of what we're reserving for. And we told – we said before that we had very little in the first quarter. We have $700
million pre-tax now. It's going to be this way for a while. We're going to have sort of elevated and lumpy litigation cost
as we work through the issues that you're aware of. And then with respect to mortgage, we have settled with a large
proportion of our MBS risks with the governmental counterparties so we do still have some other civil claims.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: But we would characterize this as more behind us than in front of us, and we're working
through it.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: First, why did trading do better than the guidance earlier in the quarter? And did that relate to
the 8% increase in trading VaR, which was a little surprising since volatility is still so low?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay. So just in – on the absolute performance, so, first of all, two things primarily contributed
to the better performance. We said 20% plus or minus; remember that really could have been plus or minus when you
go back three weeks before quarter end. There was a better activity in June, so June was a stronger month. Every day,
on average, produced a stronger result than the prior two months and that helped. And we didn't have line of sight to
that when we gave our guidance and when we affirmed our guidance. And then the second I called out the Markit
Partners shares, the IPO. We sold our shares post the IPO and generated gains of over $100 million, which is a couple
of points.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And the VaR jumps. I mean, it's very hard to predict FICC. We're always reluctant to do it
because somehow you think we actually know what's going to be ensuing in a couple of weeks. And the VaR jumps
around, but some of that jumping around is really think of underwriting positions, CMBS, warehouse positions and
stuff like that which come and go.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: Go ahead.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I always prefer more guidance than less. And then I have two have very simple questions with
complicated answers, I guess, but you talked about loan growth. Is this the inflection point for loan growth? And on the
one hand, you said, well, there's some inventory build that's helping. On the other hand, you're not seeing CapEx yet,
and two quarters ago, you said the second half of the year, loan growth should really accelerate. Do you still believe it
should accelerate from this level? Is this acceleration or you're revising back some of those expectations?
<A - Marianne Lake>: What I would say, Mike, is that what we have seen in the second quarter gives us reasons to be
optimistic that we're going to continue see growth at around those levels in the second half of the year. Like I said, it's
not that we've seen a step change, but that we have seen generally better sentiment, generally better utilization rates,
generally higher pipelines. The phones are ringing. It's across geographies. So it just feels like the environment is
conducive for us to continue to be able to add. We've been very successful in the Business Banking space and yes,
we've reached inflection in Card. So it's our belief that we'll have strong year-over-year (sic) [year-over-year growth] in
the second half but we are still in the early stages of seeing that happen.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And if interest rates increase at some point, that could hurt the ability of commercial and
commercial real estate borrowers to service their debt. How much cushion is there before you think for that would
become an issue? Or is that just not a factor?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I mean, I guess, a short answer is it's not really a factor of people who are already
income-producing locked-in rates and things like that. It may very well be a factor for people who want to build new
things, but – not on the commercial side, but we did look at on the residential side. There have been occasions we have
rising rates and improving housing. So, depending why rates are going, may be the more determining factor than just
the fact that rates are going up. Rates are going up because you have a healthy economy. That may be more important
than just the fact that rates are going up. We have not done the same thing in commercial, we probably should.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I guess the more general question is what areas in credit are you watching the most? I think,
Marianne, you said Auto is the best since 2006 and that's been an area mentioned by regulators. Is that the point of
greatest concern? Or are there other areas you're watching more closely?
<A - Marianne Lake>: For us, what we're doing is being consistent on our credit discipline. And so, we've talked I
think partly in the first half of the year about not participating in some of the growth that others saw because we've
maintained our line as it relates to particularly structures, liberal credit structures and aggressive structures rather than
pricing. And so, we are consistently doing that. We're not changing that. And our credit box across product Auto,
Mortgage, Commercial remains broadly consistent. We're not changing that either. So for us, we're just maintaining our
credit discipline. But, yes. I mean, it is a very competitive place out there right now across the products and so, we are
seeing a little bit of that aggressiveness. We saw it in the quarters running up to this and we still see it now, although
not worse.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Can you remind us of the timing of the private equity sale and how much capital is
against that? It was roughly a breakeven business. I think you have about $6 billion of outstanding. And what does that
mean in terms of freeing up capital in the Basel III and SLR world?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I don't think we've disclosed that. It hasn't been a breakeven business over a long period of time.
Obviously, it hasn't earned much money in the last few quarters. And we're still negotiating something, it could be
soon. It won't be all of OEP. It will be a part of it. And then part of the number you see, I think it's $6 billion of total
private equity, are all heritage investments that were made by JPMorgan Chase, et cetera before the Bank One merger.
<A - Marianne Lake>: That will continue.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So they're all – eventually, that $6 billion will be zero.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And that frees up, what, $3 billion of equity capital effectively.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, $3 billion. That's helpful. And on the commodities business, you gave us the
$2.8 billion of annual revenue give up and said it was ROE dilutive, but care to give the expenses and capital against
that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. So just to be clear, the $2.8 billion, if you go back and look at Investor Day, it was for all
of our business simplification agenda, not the physical commodities. I just called out physical commodities as being, A,
a big piece of it and B, as being the piece that's – the biggest piece left to happen in 2014, so just to be clear on that.
And then, yes, the $2.8 billion came with expenses of $2.3 billion against it. We didn't disclose the capital, but when
you take that into consideration, it was at or below our cost of capital, not additive to returns.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then lastly, this is probably an obvious question, but the $100 million
gain related to the IPO would have been booked in the equity trading business when you're talking about the impact to
the market's revenues.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Actually, it's in FICC.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

Your next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but could you talk
just a little bit about how much of the Mortgage business costs are fixed? And how much you would be willing to let
the volume decline?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. So, we haven't actually broken out specifically in that way but I can characterize it for
you. So obviously, in mortgage production, the first chunk of expenses, it's really variable, meaning it's paying for
production on a variable basis to the sales force. And then you have a bunch of what we would call semi-fixed costs
which are effectively the operators, the people, the sort of the FTEs. And then you do have true fixed, fixed costs which
is the management, the real estate, the technology.
When you have a very, very small market, which I think you would agree, a $1.1 trillion or lower market is very small,
then it is hard with the fixed cost structure to make a lot of money in the mortgage business, particularly if you are

taking a hard line, which we are, on the types of mortgage product that we want to participate in. But over time, it
doesn't stop the fact that is going to be a healthy functioning mortgage market and we want to be a scale player. So it's
tricky in this kind of very, very small market to – but we're focused on fixing our fixed – our cost base and trying to get
out as much efficiency as possible.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And we've been spending a lot of time on that, doing deep dives and trying to figure it out and
unfortunately, this one won't be the end of the year. Think of it as hopefully, by the end of 2015, we give you clear
sight about how we will be making normal profitability there.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: This may take until 2016.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. And it's always been a cyclical volatile business. And we had very, very strong
performance over the course of 2011 and 2012 and into the first half of 2013 and we're now that cyclical point, that
cyclical low and we need a lot of things to happen. But trust me when I tell you that the fixed cost base is our number
one focus, or among our number one focuses and we're working very hard at it.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. Just kind of a small point, you mentioned a reserve release on the private
student lending business, that was a business that you had kind of talked about potentially exiting I guess back in late
last year. Is that still on the agenda or...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're not exiting; just no longer doing it and it's in runoff mode.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right. So we stopped originating new loans, but we do have a portfolio of loans that we are
managing and as they run off, we will experience all of the usual charge-off reserve releases, but not exiting.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Thanks. I have two questions. One's a kind of detailed question, but I just want to make sure
I understood correctly. You're talking about equity trading revenues, and I think you sort of said the decline was
attributable to the equity derivatives business. So, can I imply that the – then the year-on-year sort of cash and prime
brokerage businesses were flat and all of the decline came from equity derivatives? Is that what you said?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We said it was a driven by derivatives. Cash and prime brokerage did better. Prime did better
than cash.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay. That's clear. And then just sort of a more conceptual question, I look at your core
loan growth of 4%. Obviously, everyone's commented that that's very strong and I guess about two times the industry
level. And I'm kind of reconciling that with the comments you made about C&I loan growth that's kind of in line with
the market, and you're kind of seeing some market share on resi mortgage for all the reasons you've explained to us. So,
I was just wondering if you could give some color on those areas where you're clearly taking share. And just some
outlook on how sustainable that is? Or was it just kind of a good quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So just on the mortgage thing, we're giving up share but remember that we distribute a
significant amount of the mortgages that we produce. In this quarter, we actually portfolio'd $5 billion of mortgages. So
we are not losing share in both.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Yeah. Understood.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right. So we're adding to the portfolio for mortgage, it's just a slight different dynamic. We are
outperforming on sales growth in Cards, so ultimately, that will fuel outstanding growth but hopefully, we'll be better

than the industry. But clearly, it's modest at this point. Our C&I we're in line, if not potentially gaining a little share but
we continue to outperform in real estate, particularly the multifamily real estate and Asset Management.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay. And so that all – I mean, all of those areas are areas you're targeting so they should

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. I just wanted to just step back for a moment and think about what's
occurred in the context of the key themes from the Investor Day last February, and it sounds like there's a couple of
areas where things maybe are progressing a bit more slowly than you thought, mortgage, it sounds like may be one of
them. But I wonder if in the context of the goals that you laid out, how you feel broadly you're moving against them
and whether there's been any real departures from your expectation sort of at the halfway point of the year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I think you called it well on mortgage. Obviously, the mortgage market and housing conditions
outside of home prices are challenging and that looks like it's set to be a slower journey. But if you step back and look
across all of our other businesses, when I talked about the underlying core performance drivers growing strongly, that
reflects our strategy. So we continue to build and grow our businesses demonstrated by those performance drivers, as
well as simplify and address the control agenda, and we're making the appropriate progress on both of those. And it's
showing in our results. I mean, a quarter where, obviously, there are some challenges to print over a 14% return on
tangible common equity is evidence of the strategy working.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Yeah.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And if you go through each of the comments I made in Asset Management, we're investing in
the sales force. We are seeing that deliver growth. We have record inflows. We're seeing international deliver loan
growth. It's very consistent.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Yeah. And I guess the – I'm sorry. Go ahead.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We haven't given you a roadmap on how we're going to get from 7% return on tangible common
equity to 14%. We're already at 14%.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: All right. So I guess the – I mean, the real heart of my question is we look at these financial
results which are clearly better than expectation against a backdrop, which maybe is – certainly not better, maybe worse
than what we thought at the beginning of the year, and I wonder if that then suggests that in fact, things are accelerating
ahead of the timeline or in greater magnitude than the discussion in February?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No. Look, I can't overemphasize this. We do not run the company for quarterly profits. We make
long-term decisions in people, systems, technology, products, services, stuff like that, and a lot of things drive
short-term profits. But the profit you have in any one quarter relates to decisions you made for the last five years. And
so we feel great about these companies. The big weak spot, which we all acknowledge is Mortgage and we're going to
put the – we've got great people there.
We're going to put elbow to the metal there. We're going to invest some more money in their systems. We've got some
catch up to do. We got caught in the middle of, as you know, WaMu, Bear Stearns' origination platforms. But if you
just look at each of these businesses, they're all doing fine and we're looking at how we can grow them over the next 5
or 10 years, and that's what we're going to, and I honestly mean it. I don't care whether FICC is up 10% or 15% or
down 10% to 15% in the next quarter. I actually think that's a complete waste of time.

<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. And maybe just lastly, one of the themes for this year has been maybe the narrowing
a little bit of the client base based on risk or profitability profile. I'm just wondering how that's progressing, particularly
with respect maybe to the Commercial Bank?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think most of that's been done. So you've seen – not all of it, but the full effect of that in terms
of which segments we're getting out of, which ones we're going to focus on, which ones we put enhanced monitoring
in. You saw the same thing in the CIB with our correspondent banking. There may be more. We're always going to do
good housekeeping.
And there's some clients we've had conversations with that are still on the books but they will be leaving down the
road, but none of those things will be material to the future of this company. They may affect revenues a little bit in the
fourth quarter or first quarter next year but that's not why we're doing it. We're doing it to protect ourselves, run the
business properly, meet our regulatory and control objectives.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And so – and this is the last thing for me. But does that suggest that maybe we're getting
closer to the point where the reported numbers in terms of the balance sheet – the loan expansion and the core numbers
will get closer to converging?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Think about this, the core number versus reported number being primarily driven by the legacy
mortgage and credit card portfolios. So the client activity that we've been talking about is immaterial in the context of
that runoff portfolio. That's what's driving the difference.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we will continue to see that portfolio run off. And as it runs off and gets smaller, it will
have less of an impact but it's been a fairly consistent story.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning. So on the Consumer business, just I wanted to ask a question about
the payments side and it would seem really good volume growth metrics and that turn in the origination volumes. Can
you talk just about what you're seeing in the underlying customer as opposed to what you guys are benefiting from,
from activation and new card growth? Just your general sense of the customer and spending.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. So our – and we have a large market share, so while we may be outperforming the
market, what we see is generally a fairly good picture of what's happening. And what I can tell you is if you decompose
our growth you have still strong high-single-digit growth in non-discretionary spend categories, driven principally in
the grocery and oil space, which – is not all that unsurprising, but I think is actually instructive about consumer
spending and inflation. And then if you look at the discretionary growth, which is growing even more strongly, so in
the double-digit territory, it's across the board. It's travel, it's restaurants, it's retail. It's across the board. So consumers
are spending very strongly in both categories.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Debit and credit.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Debit and credit.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And merchant processing, we're growing at like 12% a year and we're investing more money, do
a better job for merchants there. So all these payments – and we have 35 million people bank online; I think it was 15
million who use mobile bank, it was 12 million or 15 million who use mobile banking. So you're going to see us extend
products and services, all of which hopefully will be merchant-friendly and consumer-friendly.

<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: And on that merchant piece, could you just explain the disconnect between the volume side
continuing to look better and then the transaction growth rate slowing a little bit recently? Is it a larger ticket size or is
there some different underlying thing in the metrics?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's mostly merchants aggregating their transactions.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: So it's how it flows through to you guys?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Correct.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. Great. And then my just – a little question, tax rate was a little low this quarter, just
your outlook generally speaking on the tax rate going forward?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Our general longer-term outlook is our tax rate is 30% plus or minus. Just given, obviously, the
pre-tax pressures of the 2014 market, it will be slightly lower than that, more in line with the quarter...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I don't know if you mentioned it, but there's in Other, there's private equity, which was close to
zero and bounces around; there's Treasury and CIO, which was close to zero and kind of will stay there. And there's
Other Corporate, where a normal rate would be around $200 million. This quarter it was around $400 million because
of some of the tax benefits. Think of that as going back to $200 million, give or take, next quarter, for your models.

Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, thank you very much. I know a lot of questions have been asked, but I'm going to go back
to the mortgages a little bit, of the $16 billion. The market was up and depending on who you listen to, probably in the
$260 billion or $300 billion range, but you guys stayed relatively flat and it looks like really you guys gave up market
share with MBS issuance, stuff that you sell to Fannie and Freddie and maybe you picked up more market share in the
jumbo market. Of the $5 billion that you portfolioed, you talked about, was that all jumbos? And you could talk a little
bit about maybe stepping away from Fannie and Freddie?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Of the $5 billion, $3.6 billion was jumbo, about $400 million was C+ and then about $1 billion
of conventional. So that's how it breaks out, so mostly jumbo, yes, and we are holding share in jumbo.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: For the private bank too.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I'm sorry, [ph] to private bank too (01:13:39). And with respect to the market share loss, it was
principally two things. It was principally a strategy that we've talked about to do less in the high LTV, low FICO space.
We priced to the risk-adjusted return that we see in that business given the cost of service, the loans that default and
that's what the impact has been on our market share. And then also the HARP burnout, we were very successful in
HARP-ing our loans over the course of the last couple of years. Our borrowers who are technically eligible are no
longer responding, so we're seeing that burn off. The bit that's really truly the conventional loss, which there was some,
is really on price competition and we absolutely intend to compete on price.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: But when you say high FICOs, that's FHA.
<A - Marianne Lake>: FHA.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So our FHA volume is way down and we've studied FHA and based upon the lawsuits and the
premiums and stuff like that, we've lost a tremendous sum of money on FHA. We're trying to figure out what we
should do about it going forward. Just to give you three numbers, we collected $600 million of insurance, they disputed

$200 million. The government called that fraud. We reimbursed $600 million to get out of the lawsuit because there
was a threatening lawsuit, even though in my opinion, it was a commercial dispute between FHA and ourselves about
that. The whole time FHA collected another $1.8 billion in premium.
So the real question to me is, should we be in the FHA business at all? And we're still struggling with that. We want to
help the consumers there, but we can't do it at great risk to JPMorgan, so until they come up with some kind of safe
harbors or something, we're going to be very, very cautious in that line of business.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And, Jamie, a follow-up question on your utilization comments which I thought was very good,
but a lot of bankers have talked about as long as deposits growing, it's hard for that utilization rate to go up and we did
see strong deposit growth and we're still seeing utilization rates. Should that deposit growth start to go down, if we're
seeing an uptick in utilization rates?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think it slowed down a little bit.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It went down slightly, actually, in commercial.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And that's, remember, you're talking about different borrowers and issuers, so it might be some
people are still accumulating deposits and some start to borrow money, but in general, you're right.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So if you look at commercial, just as an illustration of your point, what we've got going
on is utilization rates in the last two quarters have picked up by 3 points. They're at 33%, still much, much lower than
you would expect them to be over time, which would be slightly above 40%, but you do see deposits flattening out. In
fact, there's a little bit of decline. It's not absolutely the case at this point that we can say people are starting to spend
their deposits and utilize their lines. As Jamie said, CapEx is still not really out there, but that is what you would
expect. In this business, we didn't see strong growth in deposits.

Your next question is from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hey. Good morning. So, Marianne, I actually had a question about the presentation that you
had given last month at the Morgan Stanley Conference. You alluded to a targeted loan-to-deposit ratio of roughly 70%
through the cycle. And I suppose, what I was wondering when crunching some of the numbers, given the tougher
treatment for loans versus high-quality securities under the LCR, whether there's a peak level of loan-to-deposit ratio or
growth that we should think about, given the constraints which exist under the new liquidity regime.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, first of all, just to make a contextual point which is we didn't have a target for
loan-to-deposits. We were just trying to make the point that obviously as we think forward to the impact of interest
rates on our performance over time, we would expect both a mix shift in deposits back towards interest earning and
CDs, but also expect to see the economy growing and loans growing and that needed to be taken into consideration. So
it wasn't really a target, it was just a simulation to start with that.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It was based loosely on levels that we have seen, at least in parts of the cycle that we were
referring to. And then you are right, there is a dynamic where because of LCR, we will always have a -because of our
liquidity requirements internally as well, we will have liquid assets that will be structurally higher than they would have
previously been and therefore, from a mix perspective that would have an impact, but at this point, given where
loan-to-deposits are I think that would be a high-class problem to be talking about drafting.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: And remember, there are some unused lines. There's not a loan in the balance sheet that still
needs 100% LCR, so what's really going to happen is it's going to be done at the client level, capital, LCR,
commitments, et cetera, we're just – we're going to have to really manage it, at the capital level, at the desk level, et
cetera.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thanks. And actually, that's a great transition for my next question which relates to pricing
in some of the multiple binding constraints on capital that exist today. And some of the discussions that we've had with
your competitors have suggested that some believe it's still a little bit too early to fully bake in the cost of managing to
all the different capital rule sets that exist today, whether it's risk-based, leverage-based or even CCAR. And it appears
that you've been managing more actively to all the different constraints out there. And in light of that, I was wondering
whether you've seen any impact from more aggressive pricing by peers in terms of your relative market share in certain
product areas, particularly within the CIB?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: What we've seen a little bit of is trade finance costs have gone up, a little bit in municipal
businesses. And there you see a little bit more restructuring of the type of business people do. Remember, some of the
re-pricing may not take place in the product, it may take place in the relationship, because all products have loss
leaders, et cetera, but we haven't seen a huge amount of re-pricing taking place yet.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And I think, if you think about...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I've heard some complaints, by the way, that some of the revolvers are smaller and shorter, not
the pricing as much as it is the sizing. And then you've heard some commentary in the market that inventories, of
covered bonds are lower. And if things gap out, spreads will gap out. So you're starting to see some of it, but eventually
– I've never seen a business where the cost of goods sold doesn't eventually get priced in the business, it doesn't have to
be priced into the eggs and the milk, it just has to be priced in the transaction, the whole bag that the person walks out
of the supermarket with.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And I think one way to look at it is to say, while we are absolutely managing through this
complex environment, Basel III Tier 1 Common still is our binding constraint at the margin, that's how we allocate
capital to the businesses and that's the sort of primary lens that we are using to price. And what you're going to see, as
Jamie talked about is that the leverage and LCR and other constraints including stress capital are going to play out at
the client level as we just are becoming more efficient at how we deploy our balance sheet, rather than necessarily a
re-pricing strategy.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And CCAR, we're pushing CCAR down. To the extent we can, we're going to push CCAR down
to what – those things which create CCAR-ness.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thanks. And I suppose could you give potentially any context as to what event may prompt
that re-pricing? Whether – even if the leverage rules are finalized and officially implemented this year, do you expect
that that's when you'll begin to see a lot of your peers begin to re-price some of these effects into their inventory or into
their trading securities? Or are they likely going to delay at least the re-pricing until the rules are fully implemented,
which is going to be a 2018 event?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I wouldn't hold your breath. I mean, some people leaving businesses, some are optimizing
decline levels, some are having strategic changes and it will happen over time and we're quite patient about it, we're in
no rush, we're not going to try to lead it or anything like that, it will happen over time. Like I said, you have seen it in
trade finance, you've see it in certain municipal businesses, you've seen it in – and all the rules aren't final, when the
rules become final, people may react differently.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right. Great. That's extremely helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You're welcome.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the SLR, it seems like the improvement you
had sequentially was, I think, mostly driven by capital and the preferred issuance. Can you give us sort of where we are
in terms of compression trades and the impact? Is it still a lot more to come? Or is that mostly in there.
And then I guess any thoughts or updates on SA-CCR and what that impact can be and if you expect that to be adopted
by the Fed?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, the improvements at the bank and the holding company was retained earnings, prefs net
of capital distributions, but we continue to work through all of the other initiatives we have to optimize leverage,
including compression trades and pair-ups and the like. That is actually happening a little bit more slowly than we had
thought, just broadly in the industry. It still presents an opportunity. It's not the most sizable opportunity, but we're
diligently getting after it.
And then with respect to SA-CCR, we estimated, clearly it's a complex calculation, so we'd be slightly wrong in our
estimate, we estimated it to have a benefit to the firm of 30 basis points and for the bank of 40 basis points. Yes, we
would expect that at some point, it would be ultimately adopted by the U.S. regulators, but that doesn't look like it's set
to be helping our numbers this year or next.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. Got you. And then, maybe just – I don't know if it's related or not, but as I look at
your derivatives receivable on the balance sheet, it's been declining pretty steadily; down 20% year over year. Is that
reflective of just demand, given low volatility and low activity levels? Or is there something structural there? Are you
guys actively managing your receivables down? Just trying to get a sense of the cyclical versus structural argument.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's substantially cyclical.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I wish we could actively manage it down because it's part of our G-SIB calculation, but the
truth of the matter is it is a factor of activity levels.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. It's primarily activity levels. Okay and one last one on the CDO question I think
earlier. I think we saw Citigroup settle with the DOJ regarding – and they included CDOs. I don't think your settlement
included that. Is that something that you think remains out there or just something unique to them? I know you did
settle one complaint with the SEC a few years ago. Just want to get a sense of how you think about any remaining
litigation risks around CDOs? Thanks.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We don't think it's significant.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, thanks. Just a follow-up, Jamie, on the FHA commentary that you had. I'm just
wondering about the implications for how you hit the CRA requirements? Is there any interplay there?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, so CRA, remember, is a combination of lower and middle income mortgages, so we'll
obviously try to meet those commitments. It includes how many branches you have in lower and middle income. So we
will continue to build that. It's a function of CDFI, like lending to small business, community development funds,
which we'll continue to do. So it runs a whole gamut and we will meet our CRA commitment.

Yes, if you don't do any FHA, that hurts you a little bit. But to do FHA and lose billions of dollars, that's a whole
different level of shareholder irresponsibility. And so we've got to be very careful how we handle that. I'm hoping FHA
comes forth and comes up with some real bright lines and harbors that make it easy for us to try to do what the
government wants us to do, but we can't get penalized severely for some of the things that happened.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. So doing in the FHA, you've got the Ginnies, so therefore, your RWAs were lower;
getting the same credit for CRA and loans is obviously a little bit more capital consumptive, so that's part of the
challenge?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's all of that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: But we're going to meet CRA. We report CRA to ourselves every month. And like I said, it cuts
across a wide variety of things that we do for people. We just did this great thing in Detroit that's a lot of CRA credits.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: But we could do mortgages ourselves that we can put on balance sheet that we think are less
risky than FHA insurance, so we'll figure it out. This is just a category we're just thoroughly, thoroughly confused
about, how we got treated, how we got to do it going forward, and we're kind of waiting for – and we've spoken to
government for some kind of guidance going forward.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. So this is on the reps and warranties on the FHA?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, and what you do...
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's beyond reps and warrants. It's...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's the reps and warrants, that there should be a commercial resolution of this dispute, where you
don't have treble damages if something goes wrong.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.
