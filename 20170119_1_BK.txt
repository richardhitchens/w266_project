Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Valerie, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 performance.
Our fourth quarter results capped off another solid year. Our financial performance reflects our focus on executing on
our strategic priorities, the benefits of our well-diversified low-risk business model, and our ability to create value
through all environments. Importantly, we continue to prioritize improving the client experience, delivering value today
while investing in our people, capabilities, and technology to deliver even more in the future.
For the full year on an adjusted basis, earnings per share was up 11%. Total revenue was up slightly while total expense
was down 3%, resulting in nearly 300 basis points of positive operating leverage. Net interest revenue was up 4%. We
improved our pre-tax operating margin to 33%, and our return on tangible common equity was 21%. So we remain on
track to achieve or exceed the three-year goals we set forth in late 2014.
Turning to the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, we earned $0.77 per share, up 13% year over year. For the quarter,
total revenue was up 2%. Total expense was down 2%. And we generated approximately 350 basis points of positive
operating leverage, mainly driven by higher Investment Services fees and the successful execution of our business
improvement process. And our return on tangible common equity was 21%.
Now let me update you on our progress against some of our key strategic priorities during 2016. Our top priority is
enhancing the client experience and driving profitable revenue growth. During 2016, we made progress on a number of
fronts. We continued to enhance and introduce distinctive new capabilities where we see long-term growth
opportunities.
In Investment Services, we are investing in collateral optimization technology, derivatives margin solutions, liquidity
services, middle office outsourcing for asset managers and institutional asset owners, and servicing for real estate and
private equity fund managers. We are also investing in ETF servicing to capitalize on the trend of retail investors
increasing allocations to passive investment strategies. We believe it is a trend that will likely increase post the
implementation of the DOL fiduciary rule.
We are also increasing investment in our Pershing Advisor Solutions platform for RIAs, delivering an integrated bank
and brokerage custody service as well as private banking capabilities to RIAs, a segment which we also expect to grow
more rapidly.
Our next-generation ecosystem, NEXEN, is proving to be a value-added marketplace differentiator. NEXEN will make
it easier for clients to access a broad range of solutions from BNY Mellon through a single gateway, delivering a better
client experience and driving future growth.
While Investment Management's results were a bit soft in the quarter, primarily due to our exposure to the fixed income
markets and the strength of the U.S. dollar, we are encouraged by the progress we've made on a number of fronts. In
2016, Investment Management continued to make progress against its strategic priority of repositioning its business to
focus on key products, performance, and operational and technology efficiencies to deliver profitable revenue.
We are concentrating on our high-value active strategies. Part of this effort involves increasing our alternative solutions
to meet the demands from clients, and flows remain positive in this growing asset class. A number of businesses are
attracting new flows, including Alcentra's success in expanding its private debt offering and Insight's continued
momentum in growing their absolute return capability.
In each of our areas of focus, we have established competitive advantages that position us to capitalize on industry
trends. In some cases, we are already seeing a positive impact on our earnings from our focused investments.
In terms of investment performance, on a pure relative basis and against benchmark, we continue to deliver strong
medium and long-term performance in our top strategies.

Our effort to increase our exposure to individual investors is also paying off. Wealth Management has sustained a
multiyear trend of full-year revenue and pre-tax earnings growth, the result of focusing on the high-growth U.S.
markets and on the ultra-high net worth segment.
Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process. During 2016, we further reduced our real estate
portfolio, eliminating 400,000 rentable square footage in the fourth quarter and 700,000 rentable square feet for the full
year. We drove down vendor expense and eliminated unnecessary demand and spending in areas such as market data
and internal travel.
We increased the deployment of robotics, with more than 150 bots now in production. We reduced by 10 the number of
locations where our client service delivery teams operate. We advanced our global location strategy, which has
improved our reliability and resiliency while reducing cost and risk.
We reduced manual corporate actions processing by 14 percentage points to 16% of the total volume in 2016, thus
improving straight-through processing rates, quality, and the client experience while reducing operational losses.
We closed several non-strategic low-performing businesses. And we advanced our technology efforts on many fronts,
including substantially completing the move to one custody platform in the U.S. and harnessing robotics and machine
learning to reduce costs and free up staff to focus on higher-value activities.
Entering the fourth quarter, we completed 100% of the client conversions of our new broker-dealer clearing platform.
This new state-of-the-art government clearing platform will enable us to serve the market well and grow responsibly.
And we have a full pipeline of initiatives to drive continuous process improvement forward, enabling us to offset
regulatory change costs, invest in growth, and delivering value to shareholders. We are encouraged by our progress,
and we continue to find opportunities for further improvement across all of our activities.
Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. During 2016, we invested in and focused on
compliance, risk management, and control functions, made significant investments in our resolution and recovery plan,
which included submitting an updated resolution plan that adequately addressed the deficiencies that the Federal
Reserve and FDIC had previously identified in our 2015 submission. We further rationalized our credit exposure to
certain financial institutions and sovereigns, strengthened our risk identification and operational risk control processes,
delivered key new capabilities in cybersecurity, and enhanced our capital adequacy process.
Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We remain focused on maintaining a
strong balance sheet as well as a strong capital and liquidity position while returning value to our shareholders. From a
regulatory ratio standpoint, our supplemental leverage ratio now exceeds the fully phased-in requirement.
During the quarter, we repurchased $848 million in shares, and we distributed $203 million in dividends. For the full
year, we repurchased approximately $2.4 billion in shares and distributed nearly $780 million in common dividends. So
for the year, on a gross basis, we repurchased more than 5% of our shares outstanding and have repurchased more than
19% of our shares over the last five years.
Our fifth priority is attracting, developing, and retaining top talent. People are our ultimate competitive advantage.
During 2016, we continued to strengthen our team by adding key leaders with valuable experience and outside
perspective while focusing on providing more growth opportunities for diverse talent within our company.
In December, we welcomed two new independent board members Linda Cook, Managing Director of EIG Energy
Partners and a former senior executive of Royal Dutch Shell; and Jennifer Morgan who is President of SAP North
America. Linda's distinguished international career as a senior executive in the energy industry and Jennifer's
leadership in client experience in the technology sector will provide valuable insights to our global businesses. Half of
our directors have joined in the last three years, evidence of our focus on bringing in outside perspectives to supplement
the expertise of our existing board members.
We've also made two significant leadership hires. Jeff McCarthy has joined us in the newly created role of CEO for
Exchange Traded Funds. Jeff came from NASDAQ where he was Head of Exchange Traded Product Listings and

Trading. We're bullish on the ETF administration business and think the DOL standards will only accelerate its growth.
Jeff's experience strengthens our very capable management team that is highly focused on executing for our clients and
accelerating our growth.
Geoff Massam has joined as Chief Administrative Officer for Client Technology Solutions, our technology group.
Geoff has a long career in financial technology, having been a Chief Information Officer for Capital Markets at
Deutsche Bank and CIO of fixed income IT at Merrill Lynch as well as a tech industry startup entrepreneur. So we see
him playing a key role in advancing our digital strategy.
So in summary, another strong quarter of financial performance as we continue to further develop our
high-performance client-centric culture. By executing on our priorities, we're showing a pretty consistent ability to
manage what we can control through all environments.
Now this is a new year. So once again, we look forward to continuing to demonstrate our ability to deliver for our
valued clients and our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Todd.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everybody.
Our results demonstrate that we're continuing to execute our strategy and it's working. When you look at our results for
the quarter, there are a few things that I think stand out.
First of all, we experienced growth in all Investment Service business lines with fees up 4% in aggregate. Secondly,
NIR grew nicely. Third, performance fees in Investment Management were a little softer than expected, and that's
reflecting our conservative positioning into the U.S. election. And finally, we generated significant year-over-year
positive operating leverage of approximately 350 basis points.
As we have noted in prior quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to impact results. It's negatively for revenue and
it's positive for expenses. However, the net impact from currency translation continues to be minimal to our
consolidated pre-tax line.
Turning to the financial highlights document, I'll continue my commentary on slide 4, which gives an overview of our
non-GAAP or the operating results for the quarter. Our fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.77. That's 13% higher
than the year-ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter revenue was up 2%, expenses were down 2%, and
we generated 350 basis points of operating leverage. Income before taxes was up 9% year over year. Also on a
year-over-year basis, our adjusted pre-tax margin was up two percentage points to 32%. And return on tangible
common equity on an adjusted basis was nearly 21% for the quarter, and that compares to 19% a year ago.
Moving ahead to slide 11, I'll discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 3% year
over year and up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher money market fees, net
new business, and higher equity market values that was partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar as well as
the downsizing of our UK retail transfer agency business.
Clearing services fees were up 5% year over year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily
driven by higher money market fees. Issuer service fees were up 6% year over year. That's primarily reflecting higher
fees in depositary receipts and higher money market fees in corporate trust. The sequential decrease of 37% reflects the
typical fourth quarter seasonality we experience in depositary receipts.
Treasury services fees were up 2% year over year and sequentially, and that's primarily due to higher payment
volumes. That's a decent quarter for this business. As a reminder, as rates increase, some of our fee income shifts to net
interest revenue.

Fourth quarter Investment Management and performance fees were down 2% year over year and 1% sequentially. The
year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of the strong U.S. dollar and that was principally
driven by the weaker British pound as well as lower performance fees, and that was partially offset by higher market
values and higher money market fees. The sequential decrease primarily reflects asset outflows, lower fixed income
market values, and money market fees that were partially offset by higher performance fees.
The lower-than-expected performance fees resulted mainly from the positioning of our portfolios prior to the U.S.
elections. There were underweight sectors that rallied post election, which led us to narrowly miss the high watermarks.
The good news is we are currently close to the high watermarks now, and as a result, we are positioned well to generate
future performance fees.
Importantly, we were able to keep our margin relatively stable as we continue to execute our strategy focusing on
investment performance, aligning our products and solutions, working to optimize our distribution infrastructure, and
centralizing our business functions to reduce costs.
Turning to foreign exchange and other revenue, FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was down 7%
year over year and 12% sequentially. FX revenue of $175 million was up 6% year over year and flat sequentially. The
year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher volatility as well as higher sales and trading volumes. Other trading
losses of $14 million compared with revenue of $8 million in both the year-ago and prior quarters. Both decreases
primarily reflect the impact of interest rate hedging activities, and the impact of those is substantially offset in our net
interest income.
Financing-related fees of $50 million were down 2% versus the year-ago quarter and 14% sequentially. The sequential
decrease primarily reflects lower underwriting fees. Distribution and servicing fees were $41 million. That's flat year
over year, and it's down 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects higher money market fees,
partially offset by fees paid to introducing brokers.
Investment and other income of $70 million compared with $93 million in the year-ago quarter and that $92 million in
the third quarter. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower other income related to termination fees that we received
in our clearing business in the year-ago quarter. This was partially offset by higher income from corporate/bank-owned
life insurance. The year-over-year and sequential decreases in other income also reflect the impact of increased
investments in renewable energy. Those investments generate losses in the other revenue category, but those losses are
more than offset by benefits recorded on the tax line.
Slide 13 shows the drivers of our Investment Management business that help explain the underlying performance.
Assets under management of $1.65 trillion was up 1% year over year. That's reflecting higher market values, offset by
the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. Overall, active outflows reversed the recent five-quarter inflow trend to end the
quarter down $10 billion. This was driven in part by one significant LDI mandate that was taken in-house by the client.
Long-term outflows of $11 billion included outflows and liability-driven investments that I just mentioned, equity and
fixed income strategies, partially offset by inflows into our actively managed alternative investments. Outflows from
index strategies were $1 billion, the lowest level in 2016, and we had $3 billion of short-term cash outflows.
Excluding the loan loss provision, wealth management continued its multiyear trend of full-year revenue and pre-tax
earnings growth as we focus on high-growth U.S. markets. Additionally, our program to extend banking solutions to
wealth clients through the Pershing channel continued to drive strong loan growth of 17%.
Turning to our Investment Services metrics on slide 14, assets under custody and administration at quarter-end were
$29.9 trillion. That's up 3% year over year. That reflects higher market values, offset by the unfavorable impact of the
stronger dollar. Linked quarter AUC/A was down 2%, and that's mainly driven by the dollar impact. We estimate total
new assets under custody and/or administration wins were $141 billion in the third quarter.
Looking at other key Investment Services metrics, you'll see deposits declined 3% sequentially and 7% year over year,
and that reflects the impact of us proactively managing our balance sheet in the second half of the year. Lastly, tri-party
repo balances grew a healthy 7%.

Turning to net interest revenue on slide 15, you'll see that on a fully tax equivalent basis, NIR was up 9% versus the
year-ago quarter and 7% sequentially. The year-over-year NIR increase was largely driven by an increase in interest
rates, partially offset by lower interest-earning assets. Additionally, both increases reflect the positive impact of interest
rate hedging activities, which positively impacted the quarter by approximately $25 million. Substantially all of this
impact is offset in foreign exchange and other trading revenue.
NIR also benefited by approximately $15 million due to an amortization adjustment related to premiums for certain
mortgage-backed securities. Effective October 1, we changed our accounting for the amortization of premiums on these
mortgage-backed securities from the prepayment method to the contractual method, which has become an industry
standard, and we believe is better aligned with our asset and liability management practices.
The net interest margin for the quarter was 117 basis points. That's 18 basis points better than the year-ago quarter and
11 basis points better than the third quarter. The NIM was positively impacted by the 5 basis points related to the
interest rate hedging activities and the premium amortization adjustment.
Turning to slide 16, you will see that non-interest expense on an adjusted basis declined 2% year over year and was flat
sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower staff expense and M&I, litigation, and restructuring
charges that were partially offset by higher other and software and equipment expenses.
The decrease in staff expense year over year was primarily due to the favorable dollar as well as lower employee
benefits and severance expenses. The increase in other expense primarily reflects the adjustments to bank assessment
charges that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower staff expense
and M&I, litigation, and restructuring charges, and that was partially offset by higher professional, legal. and other
purchased services that's driven by the CCAR resolution planning as well as higher software and equipment and
business development expenses. The decrease in staff expense is primarily due to lower incentives and lower severance
expenses.
As a reminder, we run the cost associated with our business improvement process through our operating P&L on a
quarterly basis. This quarter was no different. We absorbed the cost of additional actions in the fourth quarter, which
should continue to benefit us going forward.
Turning to capital on slide 17, the standardized ratios, and those of the ones that are used for the CCAR exam, were flat
to up slightly, and our fully phased-in supplemental leverage ratio fell 10 basis points to 560, as reductions in capital
due to increased buybacks, valuation decreases in our securities portfolio, and the impact of the foreign currency were
partially offset by lower average assets. We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio.
Two other notes about the quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.3%. And on page 11 of the release, we show some
Investment Securities portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pre-tax loss on our portfolio was $221
million. That compared to a gain of $1.4 billion at the end of Q3. This was change primarily driven by the sharp
increase in market interest rates.
Now let me share with you a few thoughts on themes that have been top of mind with investors, interest rates, industry
regulation, and taxes. As we look forward, we do expect some impact from the expected rise in interest rates, the net
impact of which would be a reduction in the size of our balance sheet, which should be more than offset by a higher
NIM. These changes are expected to be modestly positive to NIR for the first quarter, and that would be adjusting the
fourth quarter for amortization and hedging gains.
In terms of fee waivers, as we've indicated in the past, we thought with a 50 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate,
we would recover about 70% of our fee waivers, and that's about what we've actually seen. With an additional move
from here, we would expect to capture nearly all of it.
Our regulatory compliance costs continue to be elevated, reflecting the high cost associated with the CCAR process as
well as the investment in our resolution and planning process.
With respect to our capital distribution plans, we are working through our CCAR model now, assuming that we get
regulatory approval, but we expect to continue our capital wealth management program consistent with our past

dividend and common share repurchase goals, with a total payout ratio that we would expect to be in the range of 90%
to 100%.
As a reminder, we will be paying for the first dividend for the $1 billion August preferred share issuance, and that had a
yield of 4.625%. That's going to be paid in the first quarter, so it's important that you include that stub payment in your
models.
Regarding taxes, we expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%, as we've previously disclosed.
It's also important for you to note that tax-advantaged investments in renewable energy actually generate losses
recorded in our investment and other income line, although they're made up for in the tax line. Therefore, in 2017, we
do not expect our investment and other income line to be as strong as it was in 2016, but it should be in the range of
$60 million to $80 million each quarter, as we have previously guided.
There are a couple more factors to include in your modeling of 2017. As a reminder, staff expense will be impacted by
the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees that typically takes
place in the first quarter, so the impact that we'd expect in the first quarter this year is similar to what we saw last year.
And finally, we expect to once again generate positive operating leverage in 2017.
So with that, let me turn it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Todd, and we can now open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Brennan.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning, one quick one here on the tax-advantaged investments and the
headwind to the other, Todd, that you referenced. What geography are those investments in, and what kind of duration
are we talking about for those investments here?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: So, Brennan, they show up in the asset investment and other income line, and they can be
longer-term investments, up to 10 years. And so we're not quite fully invested, but we will be through the course of this
year. So we would expect them to generate negative revenue in the asset investment and other income and more than
offset by the impact on the tax line, so they have an attractive return to us on an after-tax basis. But that's why we
wanted them out on the call my comments that it will be a little bit of a drag on asset investment and other income, but
it's also part of the reason why we've been able to accomplish a lower-than-expected effective tax rate.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: I'm sorry. By geography, I didn't mean P&L geography. I actually meant like a
map of fifth grade geography, like which country.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Hopefully, where the wind blows, Brennan, but it's primarily in the United States.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. The only reason I asked that is just because of the – can you help us
understand about investing in something with long duration right in front of some uncertainty around corporate tax
reform?

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We would structure these things so if there was a revision to the tax, we'd have protection
on that.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, all right. Great, that's really helpful. And then my follow-up on asset
management and the outflows, with LDI, it's just sort of surprising to see continued outflow there with those strategies.
And interestingly, a rather large asset manager reported last week that they had strong indexed bond flows this quarter
with liability-driven investing driving some of those tailwinds. So is there some concern about maybe losing some
share? Do you bump up against BlackRock in any bake-offs? How should we think about the market and how you guys
are positioned there?
<A - Mitchell Evan Harris>: Brennan, this is Mitchell. A couple of things. The outflow is, as Todd mentioned, it was
really one client. If you could look underneath it, the annualized revenues quarter to quarter continue to be positive.
The pipeline is as strong as it's ever been, and it did have $26 billion in inflows over the whole year. I don't see
BlackRock coming up in a lot of bake-offs. Most of our business, as you might know, is not in the U.S. on LDI. It's
outside the U.S. It's the UK. It's Europe. It's common law areas, Australia and the like. We're just starting to move into
the U.S., and I think we'll have some momentum there.
So a lot of the momentum you're seeing is really non-U.S. LDI business. I think it will continue to build in Europe as
interest rates are moving up a little bit, and I think with our move into the U.S., we probably will see BlackRock more
in a bake-off, but the strategies are quite different, and I think we'll do very well. So performance is good. The outlook
for LDI is strong. I'm as buoyant as I've ever been about the LDI business and our ability to continue to compete with
it.

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Great. How are you, guys? Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi, Alex.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Hi. So I first wanted to touch on NIR and just help us understand the right jumping-off
point given there are a couple of moving pieces here. So as you look out, is the jumping-off point $806 million,
including the gain from pre-MM because it's more consistent, or it's closer to $791 million, which obviously excludes
both gains? So just a clear-up question there.
And then just bigger picture, as you guys think about into 2017, given how the balance sheet is positioned today, what
should we think about as a sensitivity from incremental increases in rates and also the size of the balance sheet?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, Alex. Good morning. So when you look at the fourth quarter NIR, I think the
jumping-off point is – I would tap it for the $40 million. So $25 million of that or so was on the hedging activity. That
hedging activity is just a geographic issue for us. So there was a perfectly offsetting loss in the other trading income.
So that has net impact to total earnings, but it does have an impact directly to NIR. And then the $15 million was an
adjustment because of the change in the accounting methodology. So I think that is the right point. So if you adjust for
those two things, the NIM would have been more like 1.12% versus 1.17%, still up pretty healthy 6 or 7 basis points
from where we were in the third quarter, and that's had the tailwind of the benefit of higher rates as we've repriced a
fair number of assets, and we do have deposit betas acting about as we had expected. So we are adjusting a modest
portion of our deposit base upward as well.
As we look into next year – I mean, where interest rates are going to go is anybody's guess, and that's why the guidance
I really gave was only for the first quarter. So knowing what we know, we would expect the balance sheet to come

down a little bit, which it already has, and we would expect NIM to more than offset the balance sheet move. So we
would expect to continue to see some of the improvement that we saw in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Not a
huge run-up, but a little bit [Technical Difficulty] (35:27 – 35:34). Sorry about that, we had some noise over the phone,
but does that answer your question?

<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Okay, sorry. And then just as far as just the level of excess deposits, I know the balance
sheet shrunk quarter over quarter. So I think the last time we talked about $20 billion, $25 billion was still on the
balance sheet shrunk. So is it still kind of in $10 billion to $20 billion range right now?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, that would be about where we are, and so we're following it very carefully. We're
not seeing any significant change, but it's probably declined slightly from year end.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Hi. Thanks. Hello. Thanks. Can you hear me okay? Okay. Great. Good morning. Hey, guys.
Excellent job on the full year on the cost side and clearly, with some help from the FX side. It's a busy morning, so I'm
sorry if I missed it in the release, but can you guys help us understand what the magnitude of impact was to revenue
growth, to fees, and to expenses on the FX translation as we try to just think about how the core business is acting
underneath?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. For the quarter – this isn't for the full year but for the quarter – we saw operating
revenue growth of about 2%. I think the impact from currency and it was most significantly in our Investment
Management business was about 200 basis points negatively. So we would have seen operating revenue growth of
about 4%. And on the expense side, it was also good for about 200 basis points, a little over 200 basis points.
So we saw a negative. It would have been probably flat to slightly up on expenses. And so we had recorded on an
operating basis 350 basis points or so of positive operating leverage. It probably would have been about 100 basis
points less, so around 250 basis points. As we look at the full year, the numbers are not quite so impactful, so still about
2% on revenue, close to zero on expenses. And our 280 basis points of positive operating leverage probably would
have looked more like 220 basis points to 225 basis points.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: So still a good result. Then my second question is then just as you put forward the rest of
your plans and your execution on the cost side, how would you help us think about just expense outlook looking ahead
given that benefit that was in the expense side to a modest extent? And also I know you're driving for operating
leverage. So with better revenues, I know you might not necessarily try to get expenses down again. But can you just
help us think about what your just planning thoughts are around expenses?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. And I'll probably start at a high level and hand it to Brian to go through some of the
key things that we're working on. But when I'd indicated that we do expect positive operating leverage in the full year
for 2017 once again, that does assume some modest revenue growth. And when you look down at the underlying
expenses, comp expense is our biggest driver. It's more than half of our total expense. We would expect that to be up
slightly looking at the number of programs that we're working on. Our legal and professional expense probably will be
up slightly, reflecting the ongoing requirements around compliance. Basically, the rest of the expenses should be
relatively flat, probably a little higher software amortization as we implement a number of the applications that we've
invested in. But everything else, looking pretty flat. I don't know, Brian, do you want to get into some of the detail in

the business improvement process maybe?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah, I would say that the business improvement process continues to yield the results we
want, which is helping offset the global regulatory change cost, enabling us to invest in long-term strategic growth
areas and create operating margin improvement. So a long list of accomplishments this year, but still a robust pipeline
of activity because we're driving this like a process not a project. So we expect this to drive continuous value. Some of
the areas to focus on in 2017 are continued work around the business portfolio but also the product, service, solution
portfolio and eliminating and reducing subscale or nonprofitable activities or things that don't hit our margin
expectations.
We continue to have a pipeline of client pricing initiatives that can align our interest with our clients in terms of driving
efficiency and productivity end to end for both the client and for us. We have a number of initiatives to automate and
drive straight-through processing through traditional workflow and better technology and also through robotics process
automation, which was our first year last year, but we're scaling that and we expect to get more benefit from that
process over time.
We're making progress on our technology strategy and exposing more APIs, which not only make it easier for us to
work with clients but they improve developer productivity. And we're sharing common technology services which also
gives us a higher yield on our technology investment. And we continue to do more around the global location strategy,
the global real estate portfolio, and reducing the number of locations we serve clients from, all of which are chipping
away at helping us drive continuous improvement in this area.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: One other thing I would add to that, Ken, is we are making investments to improve our
efficiencies, and we're absorbing that in our run rate. And I noted in this particular quarter, we absorbed into the
earnings some additional investments to position us well for next year. So the whole point Brian has made that we've
got a list of items that we think we can still execute and we're absorbing the cost to executing those through our regular
run rates.

Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Is Glenn there?
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. This is Mike Mayo.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sorry, Mike. Go ahead.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: So look, you're controlling what you can control with expenses and buybacks, and it sounds like
you have more of that. On the other hand, revenue growth was flat for the year. And I just want to know about you said
modest revenue growth this year, but just a little bit more color, I'd say, in three areas. Number one, the custody
business has not seen much growth for you or for the industry. Are you seeing an impact because you have more fixed
income related assets than peer? It's been a tougher fixed income market from a valuation standpoint.
Number two, as it relates to Investment Services, are you seeing risk on or risk off? And our thought was when there's
more risk on, then higher-risk custody assets would generate more fees. And then number three, as it relates to
Investment Management, you said that ETFs are in their infancy. You have outflows in actively managed funds. Are
you able to turn the tide there?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Mike, there are about 100 questions in there, but I'll start and try to give an overview, and
then perhaps ask my colleagues to jump in here as well. I think you saw in the fourth quarter, every single one of our

Investment Services businesses actually showed positive revenue growth, and that's even after taking into consideration
that about 30% or so of our asset servicing revenues are tied to the fixed income market, so 30% – 40%. So we're still
seeing growth in asset servicing and clearing services, treasury services, issuer across the board.
Would we all like it to grow faster? Yes, and we're very focused, as I said in my opening comments, about profitable
revenue growth and really making sure we're constantly improving that client experience to give them good reason to
do more business with us. So we think the pipelines in the Investment Services and asset servicing areas are strong and
good, and so we are encouraged by our growth rates there. The strength of the dollar also did have a dampening effect
on our revenues overall, both in Investment Services and in asset servicing. And when you factor all those things in, I
think it's above that 2% that you just cited.
In Investment Management, we are repositioning some of the portfolio and strengthening some of the strategies. We're
close to the high watermark, which would have allowed for higher performance fees. It didn't occur in the fourth
quarter, but we're encouraged by our performance relative to our peers and relative to our benchmarks, and some of the
strategies that we've invested in are gaining traction. So clearly, revenue growth is one of our key priorities, and we
would like to try to accelerate it, but 2016 was a tough revenue environment, but we were encouraged by our
performance in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And your guidance for positive operating leverage in 2017, how many rate hikes are you
assuming?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Right now, what we typically do, Mike, is we look at the forward yield curve, and we
factor that into our plan. And when we struck it on December 31, there were two assumed hikes in those numbers, so
one in June and one September.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. And then lastly, the risk on or risk off, are you seeing animal spirits filter through into your
business, or is that still more hope?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I think anytime there's more optimism and more confidence in the market, there's more
trading activity. More trading activity and higher levels of volatility help our business model. So we are seeing early
signs of it now.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: And, Mike, just to give a little more clarity around what asset servicing revenues look like,
remember that we're exiting our UK TA business. So those are revenues that are declining, and the dollar impact was
quite substantial in this particular quarter. So if you actually adjust for the fact that we're exiting a business that was not
profitable and giving up the revenues on that, that's part of what's helping our margin expansion and the dollar impact.
Asset servicing revenues would have been up 6% on a year-over-year basis.

<Q - Glenn Schorr>: This might be oversimplified, but I'm watching your asset yields go up every quarter as rates
went up. And you still have a slight negative rate on your interest-bearing deposits, and that's an issue of geography,
which is great for you guys. So I'm curious. What exactly are you hedging when you're hedging? And I'm assuming the
accounting for it is just that's what the accounting rules are. It would be nice if it was just inside the net interest income
line and a clean hedge. But the question is what exactly are you hedging when you're hedging?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Okay, Mike. So there is something – I mean Glenn, sorry about that. Glenn, there's
something called the overnight – the OIS [Overnight Index Swap], which is an overnight rate when you secure an
interest rate swap. So what we do is we would take our debt and we would swap it to floating to LIBOR, but that is not
a perfectly hedged swap. So we actually need to hedge based on the overnight collateral rate effectively. That basis
swap, so we're now adding another swap hedging the LIBOR rate into an overnight rate, that does not get hedge
accounting treatment. So it gets marked to market through the trading account, whereas the offset to that is in the net
interest account. It's a perfect offset.
So effectively, what we're doing is we're converting some of our debt into an overnight rate and then managing it
accordingly. But the move from three-month LIBOR to overnight does not get hedge accounting treatment, and that's
what's creating that. It's on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: No problem. This is not a new line item but just piqued my curiosity this quarter. In the
securities portfolio, you have like $16 billion of sovereign debt. 20% of it is BBB. What BBB sovereign debt paper are
you sitting on in the securities portfolio? I appreciate that market value is over its cost, but that's just a curious question.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Glenn, I don't have that off the top of my head, but most of the sovereign debt that would be
in there would be very high grade. So I'll have to take a look at that and get back to you.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, no problem. Sorry for the phone troubles. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Can you guys hear me?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes, we can hear you fine. Thanks.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Great, good morning. Just maybe back on expenses, Todd, that was great color as you went
through the lines. Maybe if you could, just clarify a little bit. You were talking about 75% of the cost base being up
slightly if you go through the buckets. Should we interpret that as maybe the total expense base on the plan being up,
say, 1% or 2% based on your up slightly comment? And then maybe if you can, talk about your flexibility on that in
different types of revenue environments, whether you're able to trim that obviously if revenue is more challenging and
whether you would actually look to accelerate some spending on growth initiatives if revenue is more favorable.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think I'll let you judge what I mean by up slightly, but I do mean positive operating
leverage. And in terms of our ability to adjust, I think the fourth quarter was a reflection of that. So based on the
revenue mix, we can make some adjustments, but we can only do so much in a short term. The key is that we continue
to progress with our sustainable cost reductions that Brian just laid out. We just need to keep executing on the
opportunities that we see.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Okay, great. Thanks. And then maybe for Brian, two initiatives that Gerald mentioned in his
opening remarks, maybe if you can shed a little bit more color on them. The ETF servicing initiative, obviously, the
trends are very positive for ETF. What are you exactly doing there to grow that business and attract ETF issuers? And
then also on the RIA side of the business in Pershing, looking at some of the bigger competitors like Fidelity, Schwab
and Ameritrade in terms of servicing RIAs, I guess, what are you doing to try to compete more aggressively with those

players or is that not quite the goal?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Sure. Okay. So ETFs first, really, Gerald mentioned it. We're just trying to take advantage
of the shift from active to passive and the expected continued growth in the ETF space. We're a significant ETF service
provider today, and we have strategic relationships with many of the big financial institutions that are the growers in
that space. And so we're hopeful that we can extend those relationships and do servicing over time.
We're investing in the technology to make it more scalable and to deliver better client experience, and we're obviously
investing in the talent as well to make sure that we have really the top team and the top solution in the industry. So
that's really what we're doing in the ETF space, and we have a serious effort on the relationship team side to cover
those opportunities more assertively.
On the Pershing front or the RIA side, again, just like ETFs will be advantaged by the DOL fiduciary standard, we
think the RIA business model will definitely be advantaged by the DOL fiduciary standard as well. It's been a
long-term secular trend shifting from brokerage to advisory model in the industry. Pershing Advisor Solutions has had
double-digit revenue growth and AUC growth for the last few years, and we expect to continue to drive significant
growth.
We focus on larger sort of more professionally managed RIA firms, so groups of RIAs, not individual practitioners. So
we tend to have less new clients than the others, but our clients tend to be bigger, more substantial, more managed
companies in the advisory space. And so we like the profile of the clients we serve. Our value proposition is I think
getting stronger in that space. Gerald mentioned the integration of bank and brokerage custody. That's really important.
Many advisors want to have a bank custodian, and we're really the only provider in the marketplace that can deliver an
integrated bank and brokerage custody experience.
We also talked about private banking services. RIAs compete with major financial institutions that have a banking
capability or private banking capability. What we're doing leveraging our partnership with the wealth management
team is delivering private banking services to the customers of the RIAs we serve. And that's actually been a hugely
successful process. We have now $4.5 billion in credit facilities outstanding, credit facilities in place with our
broker-dealer and RIA clients, and about $2.8 billion of those credit facilities have been drawn and used by the
investors of RIAs and introducing broker dealers. So we're investing in managed account solutions, digital advice
solutions, and other technology solutions to continue to grow our share in the RIA space.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: And the initiatives that you've done in terms of consolidating that onto one platform, do you
expect that to really improve the results coming into 1Q in Pershing given that you've [indiscernible] (54:44) this
quarter?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: I think unlike large broker-dealers, when you convert a large broker-dealer, you convert
thousands of advisors at a time. In the RIA space, while we're doing larger firms, it's a slower process, but we have a
strong pipeline of firms coming on. And we spent most of 2016 getting the platform integrated and converting the
existing clients we had between our bank custody and brokerage custody teams, but now we're actually beginning to
take on new clients onto the platform. And we took our first absolutely new client on in the fourth quarter. So I expect
that momentum to continue throughout 2017 and beyond.

<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Hi. I had a quick question on Investment Management. If you could, clarify what you were
saying about the positioning going into the U.S. election. I got that you were positioned one way ahead of the election,
but how does that change positioning post-election? What does that mean for both AUM growth rates as well as the fee
rates? Is that going to offset and are you going to see a snapback in the fee rates as a result of this and was more of a
timing issue? Could you just clarify that, please?
<A - Mitchell Evan Harris>: Hi. This is Mitchell. I think that what we were saying is short-term performance was
negatively impacted by the U.S. election as the equities rallied and sectors like financials took off. We were positioned
in the first three quarters really more for slower growth, which we significantly benefited by. We're not changing our
overall position. We don't react to specific events, but we do see that overall performance is good. It was a one quarter
related issue. Overall, performance is actually still very strong.
As just an example, on a one-year basis, 6 of our 10 top strategies by revenues are still in the top two quartiles and even
stronger on a three-year basis. So performance on a long-term basis is strong, but some of our strategies were caught
out at the change in market sentiment given the election. I don't think it's going to impact overall momentum given our
one-, three- and five-year performance is actually very strong, and I think we're positioned fine for the new year.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. And then just a quick question following on the kind of branching out more into the
ETF space. I mean, does that give you – do you reconsider the multi-boutique model and whether or not – I know you
like the model but I mean, is there additional efficiencies you think you could pull out of that model?
<A - Mitchell Evan Harris>: There are always efficiencies that we're looking at from the model. Anything we can do
at leverage and scale, we're continuing to push through. Anything we can do with the company more broadly. Brian's
group on ops and tech, we're looking to do, and we think there is more particularly on the ops and tech side. And there's
always tweaks as the markets change where we can continue to leverage the organization, and we'll continue to do so.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Broadly, asset management, like other businesses, scale is going to matter, and we do want
to use the scale benefits of the entire company for the benefit of our asset management boutiques, help lower their
structural costs, and still have them focus on their investment performance and their distribution strategies. So we think
there's opportunities to apply scale benefits to our asset management boutiques and still keep it in the boutique
structure.
<A - Mitchell Evan Harris>: Brian has mentioned in the past that asset managers in general, be it a multi-boutique or
any model, need to focus more on their core competency, which is asset management, and other things that are not
directly related to the investment process, we want to give to third-party providers. In our case, the third-party provider
is in-house, and we'll continue to do that.

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: It's a great question. We look at it in a variety of different angles, one, starting with
supporting the advisors on the Pershing platform because they're in the midst of it on a direct basis every single day of
the week. So giving them the toolsets and utilizing our platforms and technology to help the advisors capture that
wealth transfer is one of the important elements.
Our own wealth management area spends a lot of time thinking about this and making sure the multigenerational shift
is one that they continue to service and service well, and on the asset management side, making sure we have strategies
in place on third-party distribution platforms to help capture that asset shift in flows is also one of the areas of
opportunity. So it is a big shift. It's one of the reasons why we like our platform businesses and our wealth businesses
as much as we do because it is going to be a very significant transfer of wealth and assets into new hands and we have
to be all over it. So we do think about it a lot.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. And then maybe a quick question for Todd. On the negative rates that you guys
are still experiencing in the foreign deposits, how has that moved since the election? I know the negative rate went
down by 1 basis point, but are you seeing any acceleration where it may turn positive later this year in that category of
deposits?

15% to 20% of our deposit base is in non-dollars. A smaller percentage of that is in euro, which is mostly what's
driving that. So in some instances, there are some pretty substantial negative rates. The U.S. deposits are slightly
positive, and we do have deposit betas. And what that means is as interest rates go up, we will pass on some of the
benefit of those rising rates to our clients. So the initial moves are probably a bit compressed, and then our clients will
start to get more of the benefits. That's kind of how the betas work. So we would expect to see that cross over into a
positive rate in the next quarter or two.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. I appreciate it.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thanks, Gerard.
