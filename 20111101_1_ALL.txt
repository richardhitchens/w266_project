MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate Corporation third quarter 2011 earnings conference call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President, Investor
Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Robert Block
Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's third quarter earnings
conference call. Tom Wilson, Don Civgin, and I will make some brief remarks to provide more color on our results for
the quarter. We will then hold a question-and-answer session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one
follow-up so that we can hear from as many folks as time permits. Joining us for the Q&A session are Judy Greffin, our
Chief Investment Officer, Mark LaNeve, Senior Executive Vice President, Agency Operations and Chief Marketing
Officer; Sam Pilch, our Controller; and Matt Winter, Senior Executive Vice President, Insurance Operations and
President and Chief Executive Officer of Allstate Financial.
Late yesterday afternoon, we issued our press release and investor supplement as well as filed our 10-Q for the third
quarter 2011. We also posted a slide presentation which will be used in conjunction with the prepared remarks. All
these materials are available on our website.

Our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Actual results may differ
materially from those statements. Please refer to our 10-K for 2010, our 10-Q for the third quarter, and our press release
for information on potential risks.
The discussion may also contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and
on our website. After our call concludes, Christine Ieuter and I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you
may have.
So let's begin with Tom Wilson. Tom?
Thomas J. Wilson
Good morning. I'd like to begin our conversation by reviewing our strategy and operating commitments for 2011. Then
I'll compare this to our third quarter results and discuss our 2012 priorities. Bob and Don will then go through the
underlying drivers of our results.
If you begin on slide two, we're in the business of selling protection products to consumers based on their preference
for price, service, and delivery channel. The long-term strategy is designed to evolve with the changing marketplace.
Our Board and management are fully aligned behind the strategy and goal of generating an operating return on equity
of 13% by 2014. To do that, we're focused on three near-term priorities. First, we must maintain margins in the auto
insurance business at industry leading levels. Secondly, we must improve returns in homeowners and Allstate
Financial. Thirdly, we must aggressively manage our capital. On a longer-term basis, we're repositioning our products
and distribution platforms to meet the changing needs of customers. So near and long term, of course, we continue to
manage our most powerful asset. That's the Allstate brand, and it gives us unparalleled access and opportunity within
our core businesses and to each of the company's core constituencies.
So let me review our progress in the third quarter on slide three. We strengthened the breadth of the Allstate brand
standard auto insurance profitability by improving combined ratios in New York and Florida. Both of those states
continue to have loss ratios that are higher than the countrywide average. So the results have improved significantly
relative to 2010, reducing the pressure on countrywide results. The rest of the country continues to have strong results.
The overall combined ratio for Allstate brand standard auto insurance is 94.2 for the quarter and 95.8 for the first nine
months of the year. The Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio was 131.9 for the quarter, of which 55.8 was due to
catastrophe losses. To improve returns, we continue to increase prices and downsize this business, where the average
premiums are up 5%, and that is a 4% reduction in items in force versus a year ago. The underlying combined ratio was
72.3 for the nine months, which was a 0.9 improvement from the prior year. For the quarter, it was 1.7 points better
than the prior year. Overall, the Property-Liability underlying combined ratio was 88.9 for the first nine months, which
is at the favorable end of our committed range of 88 to 91 for the year.
Allstate Financial had a solid quarter with operating income of $134 million, a 24% increase from the third quarter of
2010. The returns from Allstate Financial were improved over the prior year as a result of higher investment income
and lower crediting rates. The fixed deferred annuity business declined by $4 billion in contract [ph] or held (4:40)
balances since the year end of 2010, as surrenders continue to outpace new sales.
Proactive management of the investment portfolio gave us three great results. We maintained deals. We realized
substantial capital gains, and we increased the absolute level of unrealized gains in the portfolio from the end of last
year.
Our capital management program includes an active outsourcing program for products such as homeowners and
annuities. In the homeowners business, we've reduced our items in force by 1.2 million or 15% over the last four years
and in part by offering coverage from other carriers. Today we broker homeowner premiums in many markets, the vast
majority of which is Florida and other hurricane exposed areas. And as you know, of course, we are a substantial user
of reinsurance, which enables us to shift risk to third parties and recover most of the cost through higher prices from
customers.

Allstate Financial uses similar strategies. Of course, we sold the variable annuity business in 2006, but the Allstate
agency distribution channel sold $736 million of non-proprietary variable annuities in the first nine months of the year.
Earlier this year, we instituted a similar strategy for fixed annuities, so fixed annuity deposits declined to $439 million
so far this year. So the Allstate agency distribution channel expenses were reduced by increased fees in these
arrangements.
This capital management strategy, what it does is it enables us to meet our shareholders' objectives of getting a 13%
operating return on equity without sacrificing customer relationships, and so we'll continue to aggressively use those
tools as ways to improve shareholder value.
We also completed our most recent $1 billion share repurchase program at the end of the quarter, which was about five
months ahead of schedule. As you know, we usually determine our capital plans in February after the conclusion of
catastrophe season and when we have a good read on year-end capital ratios. We're accelerating that review into the
fourth quarter of this year.
Let me finish current results by commenting on some important organizational changes. As you know, to drive higher
performance and increase urgency, we've been changing our performance management practices and rebuilding
Allstate's top management team, which includes replacing some people who retired. Sixty percent of our senior
leadership team joined the company within the last four years, which when combined with the breadth and depth of
Allstate experience from the remaining 40% gives us a really good blend of external and internal perspectives. As a
group, this team is dedicated to urgency. It has a great sense of urgency. It's completely aligned and is deeply
committed to the strategy to deliver the value that we know you all expect.
Given the strength of our senior leadership team and similarities of our businesses, we decided to move to a flatter,
more streamlined operating model that separates responsibilities for Allstate Protection along functional lines. So in
addition to his role at Allstate Financial, Matt will oversee Allstate Protection claims, product operations, risk
management, and program management. Mark LaNeve's responsibilities have been expanded to include Allstate
Protection's field and agency operations in addition to his role which was to lead marketing and sales and service
programs. This move will shorten the lines of communication and improve our responses as an organization to an
ever-changing marketplace.
As we look forward to 2012, our priorities are very similar to 2011. We must maintain profitability of the auto
insurance line. Improving returns in homeowners and annuities will continue to be urgent priority for us. Aggressive
capital management will continue to be a tool for us to improve operating return on equity to 13% by 2014.
In addition, we need to adapt the strategic positions of our businesses to reflect the changing consumer marketplace.
The ability to ensure Allstate customers receive highest level of service from our agency force is as critical as ever to
the success of those Allstate agency businesses. That's why we're building stronger local agencies. This is a program
that has been implemented in phases over the last four years, most recently including a prospective change to agency
compensation in 2013. Our goals are to build up the average size of agencies so they have the capabilities and financial
wherewithal to meet customers' needs at an affordable price. We support the mergers of agencies by loaning a portion
of the purchase price to high performing agencies. This program has loaned about $250 million at this point with
minimal losses, and we expect to continue to increase over the next three years. Since 2009, the average size of our
U.S. agencies has increased by 10%, and the overall number of agencies is down by 14%.
The recently announced compensation change will have the same overall cost to the company, but compensation will
be shifted to those agencies that are performing at higher levels. All of those changes are supporting increased
performance on behalf of customers who prefer the personal touch of a local agency. For those customers who want a
personal touch but are less concerned about the brand and choose to buy through an independent agency, we have new
leadership for Encompass and believe our skills and capabilities will enable us to earn solid profitability in that
channel.
We also closed on our purchases of Esurance and Allstate Answer Financial in early October and are implementing
strategies to improve the value of that franchise. Esurance will be able to leverage our preferred risk pricing expertise

and very importantly our claim protocols and systems that both of which enable them to improve their competitive
position. In addition, they're already leveraging Allstate brand by changing the tag line to "from Allstate." And they
also hired a new advertising agency to position the Esurance brand to compete more effectively with those self-directed
or self-serve customers. We now have all the business platforms we need to be successful in protecting U.S. customers
while generating a 13% operating return on equity by 2014.
One final update as we look forward to 2012; based on the results of last May's shareholder vote, I embarked on a
corporate governance listening tour. I met with shareholders that own about 30% of Allstate's outstanding shares and
the major governance advisory firms. Those were productive and helpful meetings. As a result, the Board is actively
working on governance and compensation plan changes to be responsive to their feedback.
Now Bob and Don will cover more of the detail on this year's third quarter results.
Robert Block
Thanks, Tom.
On a consolidated basis, total revenues of $8.2 billion increased 4.2% from the third quarter of 2010 on the strength of
$264 million of realized capital gains versus $144 million of realized capital losses in the third quarter of 2010.
Consolidated net income of $165 million declined by $202 million from last year's third quarter. Increased levels of
catastrophe losses which negatively impacted net income by $449 million after tax were partially offset by favorable
effects of higher after-tax realized capital gains of $170 million.
Looking at Property-Liability on slide four, net premiums written of $6.7 billion declined slightly quarter over quarter,
a result similar to the first two quarters of the year. Allstate brand standard auto net premium written at $4 billion was
down 0.8% compared to the third quarter of 2010 as lower unit volume more than offset a small increase in average
premium. New business volume was comparable to the second quarter but off by 13.2% from the third quarter of 2010.
Retention improved by 0.4 percentage points relative to last year's third quarter and remained consistent with the first
two quarters of this year. Profitability actions taken in New York and Florida have negatively impacted unit growth, as
expected. Excluding those two states, our policies in force growth was slightly positive for the quarter.
Allstate brand homeowners' net written premium of $1.6 billion increased 1.5% from the third quarter of 2010 as we
continue to seek and receive approval for rate increases. In the third quarter, we received approval for rate increases in
15 states, averaged 13.9%. Canada and emerging businesses both contributed positive net written premium and unit
growth in the quarter.
The Property-Liability combined ratio for the third quarter was 104.8, and included 16.7 points of catastrophe losses.
This compares to the combined ratio for the third quarter of 2010 of 95.9, which contained 5.9 points of catastrophe
losses. The underlying combined ratio was 89.2 for the quarter and 88.9 year-to-date, well within the range we
established at the beginning of the year.
During the third quarter, we conducted our annual detailed assessment of our discontinued lines and coverages reserve
levels. We made some minor adjustments to the reserves similar to last year, which resulted in an immaterial increase
to the overall combined ratio for the quarter.
On slide five, we provide the loss cost trends for Allstate brand standard auto. Bodily injury frequency improved by
3.3% relative to the third quarter of 2010, while property damage frequency declined by 2.6%. Paid severity results for
both coverages increased slightly with increases of 0.2% and 1% for bodily injury and property damage respectively.
Auto loss cost trends remained well within the range of expectations contemplated in our pricing. The combined ratio
for standard auto was 94.2 for the quarter, an increase of one point from the third quarter of 2010.
Homeowner loss cost trends are displayed on the next slide. Excluding catastrophe losses, frequency increased 6%
from the third quarter 2010, reflecting heavier non-cat weather losses in the quarter. The frequency pattern was
consistent with the last several years. Paid severity increased 3.3%, a level of increase similar to the first two quarters

of the year. The combined ratio for homeowners was 131.9, with catastrophe losses accounting for 55.8 points. The
underlying combined ratio improved relative to the third quarter of 2010, coming in at 73.3, 1.7 points better than last
year's result. Rate actions to improve the profitability of this line continue to be reflected in these results.
Allstate Financial results are shown on slide seven. They had a solid quarter. Net income of $183 million increased $98
million from the third quarter of 2010 on the strength of improving operating income and realized capital gains.
Operating income of $134 million increased $26 million as increases in investment spread and lower expenses were
only partially offset by a decline in the benefit spread. Premium and contract charges were essentially flat in the quarter
as increases from underwritten products were offset by declines in annuity sales, as expected. We continued to
successfully execute on our strategy of reducing the concentration in investment spread products while improving the
profitability of those products, focusing on sales of underwritten products through the Allstate agencies and growing
Allstate benefits.
Now I'll turn it over to Don.
Don Civgin
Thanks, Bob.
As we've done consistently in the past, we've had clear objectives and we've been proactive in the way we managed our
investment portfolio. And again this quarter, our approach has paid off in the form of investment income, realized gains
and an attractive risk/return position.
Looking at page eight of the presentation, the overall portfolio finished the quarter at $97.5 billion, a small decline from
the second quarter of 2011, as the Allstate Financial portfolio continued to decline, as planned, consistent with Matt's
strategy to downsize the annuity business. During the quarter, we took advantage of market opportunities to realize
gains from sales of primarily government and corporate securities and reinvested those funds into intermediate-term
investment-grade corporates. This resulted in a reduction in the allocation of governments and an increase in the
allocation of corporates. You can also see on the right side of this page that we're maintaining the shift in the
distribution of fixed income securities by scheduled maturity date towards the three to ten-year category. This is, again,
consistent with what we discussed last quarter.
Net investment income and yield trends are displayed on the next slide. Even in this difficult environment, overall
portfolio yields improved compared to prior year as a result of our first quarter interest rate curve and derivative
positioning, additional high yield allocation, and limited partnership distributions. The sequential decline in the
Property-Liability portfolio yield was driven by a seasonal drop in foreign dividend income in the third quarter relative
to the second quarter. Overall net investment income at $994 million fell by 1% compared to Q3 2010. Increased net
investment income for Property-Liability was more than offset by the decline in Allstate Financial due to expected
declines in the size of their portfolio. In both portfolios, enhanced yields produced favorable variances to income, while
declines in the average assets countered the favorable trends.
We generated $264 million of realized capital gains in the quarter, as shown on the next slide. That compared to $144
million of realized capital losses in the third quarter of last year. As I mentioned previously, we took advantage of
market opportunities in our fixed income portfolio to realize $692 million on sales of foreign governments, treasuries,
and other fixed income securities, with the proceeds being reinvested primarily in intermediate-term investment-grade
corporates. These gains were partially offset by $203 million of impairments and $234 million of derivative losses. The
impairments arose primarily in our residential and commercial real estate and equity asset classes. And in the derivative
category, the majority of the losses were interest rate related.
The unrealized net capital gain position at the end of the quarter was $2.36 billion, down slightly from the second
quarter. Unrealized capital gains on our fixed income portfolio increased to $2.46 billion from $1.91 billion at the end
of Q2, while the equity portfolio's unrealized position went from a $625 million gain to a $95 million dollar loss,
reflective of the equity markets experience in the third quarter of this year.

Moving to our capital position on slide 11, shareholders equity was $18.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, a
decline of $664 million from the second quarter of 2011. We completed our share repurchase authorization, buying
$308 million in the quarter. Book value per share of $35.56 was essentially flat from prior year and down about $0.40
from Q2 2011.
The statutory capital levels of our insurance companies remain strong with an estimated $14.4 billion at the Allstate
Insurance Company and an estimated $3.7 billion at Allstate Life Insurance Company. We paid a $200 million
dividend from AIC to the holding company during the quarter, bringing invested assets at the holding company to $3.4
billion.
As we've discussed previously, we've been hard at work to dissolve the Allstate Bank. And during the third quarter we
received regulatory approval to voluntarily dissolve Allstate Bank. We expect to return all funds to customers, cease
bank operations, cancel the charter of the bank, and deregister the Allstate Corporation as a savings and loan holding
company by the first half of 2012.
Lastly, following the close of the quarter we completed the acquisition of Esurance and Answer Financial for
approximately $1 billion, and we will begin to reflect their results with our fourth quarter report.
Now let's open up to your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Glasspiegel from Langen McAlenney; your question, please.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Good morning, everyone. I was just wondering if you could dig into Esurance and your
strategy, and specifically how you're going to integrate Answer Financial into your agency distribution plan. For
example, when they aren't able to close an account, will you offer that as a vehicle to potentially save customer
relationships?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Good morning, Bob. This is Tom. I'll make a couple comments and maybe Don Civgin will
want to jump in as well. First, the way we look at the marketplace, we have four segments of customers. Those who
want a personal touch through a local agency and want a branded product buy through the Allstate agencies. Esurance
is really targeted towards those who are self-directed or prefer self-serve and want a branded experience. And what we
intend to do with that business is position it squarely towards them.
Before we acquired them, they had a value proposition which applied more across that board. It was people when you
wanted technology; when you don't, that applies to the whole segment. We'll get it a little more focused on the
self-directed customers with the new branding program they're working on. At the same time, we're much better in
preferred risk pricing and we're we have great claims capability. We believe we can reduce the variability of their
claims cost, use our resources, our systems, and our relationships to lower the cost which will make them more
competitive, which should help us compete more aggressively in that marketplace. So it will operate as a separate
business, but then leveraging the skills and capabilities that reside inside Allstate, including things like the brand, as I
mentioned earlier.
Answer Financial, as you know, really serves those self-directed customers who have less preference for a brand. And
what Esurance does is when you call Esurance, if they can't close you, they then route you to Answer Financial.
Answer Financial gets business from other places as well. So what that does is enable Esurance to lower its advertising
cost versus other people because it's monetizing those people who call who they don't close. And that program works
quite well for Esurance and Answer Financial, as you point out.
That segment of the market seems to be growing. And we, of course, with Answer Financial then is place that business
with a whole variety of carriers, which we continue to do, and it continues to grow. What we do, we haven't decided yet

to do with those quotes that come from the people who want personal touch loyalists in the Allstate agencies whether
we will route those to Answer Financial or not. We're going to test that in the next six months or so and get a feel for it.
Of course, you know we get millions of quotes that come into the Allstate agencies. Some of those quotes we don't
close right at that particular time because the person is not ready, but they really want that local agency. Some of those
people just call because they saw our ad and they'd be perfectly happy to buy it on their own or buy it from somebody
else. We have to sort through really that flow, but we are working at how to optimize the overall system. Does that
answer your question?
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Yes, very well, one other follow-up. Did you push the comp change from 2012 to 2013?
And if so, what was behind the delay?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: It was initially discussed as middle of 2012. But we have been – when we did this comp
change, we don't just sit in a room and make it up. We had over 300 agency owners working with us through various
groups to help us figure out how to design it. When we looked at the timing of it, what it took for them to change their
business model, how we could get accuracy around the numbers so that it really drove behavior, and quite honestly to
give people a little runway to adapt to the thing, we moved it back to the beginning of 2013. We did give some people
who were excited about the change and believe it will work and support the business model the opportunity to opt-in in
July of 2012 if they want. So it becomes effective for everybody, Bob, the beginning of 2013. But we're letting some
people choose to get in the program, which we see as a good opportunity to help people see how you can win with the
new program. Does that make sense?
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Yes, thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital; your question, please.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you. In terms of being able to achieve the 13% return on equity by 2014, it seems the
biggest lever for that is improvement in the homeowners business. And given the recent track record on catastrophe
losses, I'm just trying to get a better handle on what type of catastrophe load you're including on that to be able to
achieve those results or what other steps you're taking to improve the all-in homeowners results.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Jay, your math is right. About 70% of the improvement is due to the homeowners business
from where we've been historically to where we are recently to where we need to go. And as it relates to the catastrophe
load, it's the average of what we would have experienced over the last ten years as opposed to what we've experienced
this year. This year, the last two quarters, we've had higher catastrophe losses than if you look back at the prior 20
years, higher in just these six months than 18 of the last 20 years. So these last couple of months have been particularly
bad, as you all know and you can it see in our results.
As it relates to how do we reduce our catastrophe exposure, that's part of what I talked about in terms of some of that
we just do through normal insurance underwriting, insuring the right houses, getting deductibles up, making sure we
have the right standards as to what we charge for different kinds of roofs and things like that, so getting pricing right.
We also, of course, aggressively use reinsurance and brokering. And I think this is an area where I haven't
communicated enough to you how much brokering we actually do. We broker a huge number of policies where we can
maintain the customer relationship. So while we want to serve those personal touch loyalists with everything that they
need, we don't have to make it all. And we've done that successfully in homeowners. We've done it in variable
annuities, and we're now doing it in fixed annuities. To the extent we need to do more of it in homeowners to get to our
return, we'll do as much as we need to do.
Can I just – [ph] Curt (28:24) just pointed out to me that the opt-in on the agency stuff, Bob (sic) [Jay] (28:32), was
eliminated as part of some additional changes we made. People apparently didn't feel there was a big need to opt in, so
we took that out.

<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: My second question is on the change in DAC accounting for 2012. Allstate has $4.4 billion of
deferred acquisition cost. And even though it said in the Q you're still trying to determine what the impact is, do you
have an early sense of what the potential for write-downs may be and whether or not that will impact 2012 earnings?
<A - Don Civgin>: Jay, at this point, I have no estimates of the impact either on the balance sheet or the income
statements, so we will adopt it as we're required to at beginning of next year. And when we have an estimate, we'll
share that with you.

Your next question is from Keith Walsh from Citi; your question, please.
<Q - Keith F. Walsh>: Good morning, everybody. First question for Tom on standard auto, just looking at new
applications down 13% and down 7% ex-Florida and New York, I'm just trying to understand why that is if the ad
spend continue to be robust, if you can give us some color around that. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Sure, Keith. First, let me point out the results on new business in a quarter never do exactly
what you did in that quarter. So I would say that the results in this quarter were due to things that we had done much
earlier, whether that's advertising, pricing, where we are with agency capacity, so there is a lag impact as to what you
do in a quarter. With that said, it's hard to do a variance analysis, of course, but I would say it's a combination of really
three things, maybe four I guess: rate increases, lower share of ad spend in the third quarter, fewer producers, and
higher homeowner rates. And it's hard to split that up. When you look at the rate increases we've had, it's a little
masked by the shift in reducing volumes in Florida and New York, which are high average premium states. So we have
had increases in other states, not huge, but at the margin they make a little bit of a difference.
We have lowered our ad spend in the third quarter. Now we're up this quarter because the competition continues to stay
strong. Sometimes we back off a little bit to see what other people will do. But as ad spend stayed up, State Farm
started spending more money. You'll see our ad spend be up again this quarter. Fewer producers, we're really working
on now expanding the number of licensed sales professionals inside our agencies. While our number of agencies are
down, we can increase capacity by increasing the number of licensed salespeople who work in those agencies. And
then higher homeowner rates, obviously, takes a toll because homeowner rates are a place where you can start to lead
the business. Once you get the homeowners, it's easier to get the auto insurance.
<Q - Keith F. Walsh>: Okay, great, and then just a follow-up for Matt, on the Life side. Just thinking about the new
business returns there on the Life side, are they in line with the 13% ROE objective with interest rates at current levels,
or is the mix of business now more dependent on mortality/morbidity margins than interest income? Thanks.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Those are great questions, Keith. So just for clarity, I think at our Investor Day, we talked
about the Allstate Financial returns, getting them up to the 9% to 10% range. And the 13% you're referencing was for
the overall enterprise. So within Allstate Financial, obviously, we had an overweighting in the investment products, the
spread-based products that in today's interest rate environment create a lot of pressure on returns. We've done, I think, a
pretty good job with getting increasingly sophisticated in our ALM in order to maximize investment returns, and we
managed to do that again this quarter. And despite the decline in the size of the portfolio and the interest rate
environment, we managed to actually grow our return.
But I think as time goes on, we'll be under additional pressure. Certainly if this interest rate environment persists for an
extended period of time, it will probably accelerate our desire to shift the mix of business towards more of a
morbidity/mortality component and a fee component and away from the spread component. We had already begun that
at the end of 2008. We accelerated it in 2010, and we're getting the results that we wanted, Keith. So it's a fine line; you
want that portfolio to roll off, but do so in an orderly and methodical manner so that you don't have pressure to sell
assets at the wrong time. We've had the right runoff in the business. It has done what we hoped it would do. And at the
same time we've grown the mortality and morbidity-based business, so we're comfortable there.

And as you know, the returns on the underwritten business are significantly higher than the spread-based businesses
and are in the low teens. And we believe that on some of those products, especially the accident and health products,
we can go in the high teens on a consistent basis. So as a result, the more we shift away from the spread-based business
towards the underwritten business, whatever interest rate environment we're in for the next three to four years, it will be
to our advantage as long as we do so fairly methodically.

Your next question is from Alison Jacobowitz of Bank of America Merrill Lynch; your question, please.
<Q - Alison Jacobowitz>: Hi, thanks. I was wondering if there is any chance you could give some more color on the
extent that New York and Florida are holding back your margins or maybe how that might progress going forward, or
some details on the progression already, but quantified.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Alison, this is Tom. Both of those businesses are now operating profitably. Of course, you
get all kinds of measures of profit, whether that's run rate includes reserve releases, doesn't include reserve releases. But
we feel good about where those businesses are. As I mentioned, they are operating at a combined ratio that's higher
than the overall level, but I feel very good about the trends.
We made additional progress in the third quarter on a variety of fronts, including rates, including the way in which we
handle our personal injury protection claims. We made good progress in getting those costs down. As well, we've also
gone in to do a bunch of correct class work in New York in the third quarter as well. So I feel very good about the
underlying strength of what we're doing. It will bounce around from quarter-to-quarter. But it certainly – from my
perspective, it certainly made the auto profitability much more robust when you look at it across the whole country.
<Q - Alison Jacobowitz>: Thanks.

Your next question is from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs; your question, please.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks. So on your ROE goal, you mentioned homeowners. I guess I'm trying to
understand. If that's competitive market, how much can you raise pricing there without eventually hurting auto
retention as a result of the bundlers and then just generally overall profitability? And then to have one follow-up.
Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Mike, this is Tom. We're not having a lot of problems raising prices right now either with
regulators or competitors. Of course, that's no surprise since we're all losing money. But we haven't had – and so you
can see the increases. We continue to get average premium – the average is up 5%. That includes some fall-through
because when you take rates up higher than that, some people raise deductibles and do other things, which of course
works to – even though you're not getting it in rate, you're getting it in margin because you don't have the loss cost
associated with that. So we don't see competitive pressure there.
You do have some customers who obviously don't like big price increases. And one of the things we've been doing is
put increased spread into our rates. So if we say rates are up 9% in a state, some customers might be up 30%. Other
customers might be down 5%, which is about getting more accurate in our pricing, particularly as it relates to roofs and
wind and hail damage. And so that does have a negative impact on the auto business. We don't accept it as a good

excuse not to grow the auto business. But we recognize that, in fact, it does have a negative impact. So you can't be
down 1.2 million policies in homeowners and not have lost some auto policies as a result of it. That said, our goal is,
first and foremost, is we've got to get our returns up. So our returns, we want to get to 13% operating return on equity.
We're going to do everything we need to do that. You can see we've done that in homeowners, really over the last –
since I don't know, since 2004, 2005, we've been banging away at this thing. We're going to keep banging away as
aggressively as we need to, to get returns up.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay, thanks. And then just on the other lever, being capital deployment, do you plan on
buying back more in stock than you generate in cash?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Do I plan on buying back...
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: In other words, do you plan to deploy more than you make?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, if you look at our history, we've not used leverage in a massive way to buy back
stock, right? We do occasionally restructure our capital structure, so I think – I don't know was it four, five years ago,
we did – or maybe it was six years ago, we did a hybrid and we bought some stock back. But in general, the way we
look at stock repurchases is how do we – if we have extra capital, we return that to shareholders either through
dividends or share repurchases. And then we always look to just optimize the capital structure. We'll do that in the
fourth quarter. Normally, we would do that in February when we got through cat season and we knew exactly where we
were coming out on capital ratios for the year. And it gives you a greater base from which to look forward. We're going
to accelerate that into the fourth quarter of the year. We didn't do it already, quite simply, because the hurricane season
is just ending, as evidenced by some activity down in Mexico last week.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Right.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: So we just didn't feel it necessary to have it completely linked up. That said, we thought the
stock price was attractive, so we went and got it and decided we were going to finish the program early.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay, got it. I guess my question is so if cash flow from the P&C companies, year-to-date I
think it was $500 million. Last year, full year, it was $1.4 billion; and before that, just over $2 billion. And the cash
dividend is about $400 million. So I'm just trying to figure out how you're thinking about deployment versus how much
you make and how much you're deploying already through the dividend. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Let me see if I can be helpful. We, of course, look at how much capital we have at a given
point in time, and we think we're adequately capitalized today. We haven't made as much money as we would like this
year because of catastrophes. They were at $3.7 billion versus all year last year they were at $2.2 billion. So we had
expected, of course, to make more money because we didn't think the cat piece would be at such a high level. We do
believe we still have enough capital, which is why we went out and bought the stock back early.
What we do is we look at how much capital we have at a particular point in time, and then we also look at what we
think we're going to make going forward in the future. We tend to have a little bit of a lag on that. We like to be a little
long in capital rather than cut it right to the margin. So as you look at where we are today versus where we thought we
would be, we have less deployable capital today than we thought we would have because of higher catastrophes. But
that said, I feel good about the underlying profitability of the business. I don't feel good about catastrophes, but that's
always a little speculative as to what it's going to be next year. But I feel good about the underlying performance of the
business. And of course from a capital standpoint, we're incredibly solid. We have a lot of capital and we're very strong
in terms of our ratings, so I'm not concerned with that part. So I think we have flexibility to make choices. I don't know
what those choices will be yet because I want to see where we're going to come out in our overall analysis in the fourth
quarter.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks.

Your next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse; your question, please.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Good morning, a follow-up to the earlier question regarding the interest rate
environment. So if the current environment did persist, I know you've talked in the past about a target of $1 billion of
excess capital being generated in Allstate Financial. Would that be impacted? And then also if you could talk about the
overall net interest income outlook for the company; I know you guys' yields have held up well. Are you guys going to
continue to shift toward corporates? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Let me see if I can break it into pieces, and Matt can feel free to jump in. Returning $1
billion of capital from Allstate Financial continues to be our goal. Interest rates obviously will affect how much money
we earn. But remember, part of the capital coming out of Allstate Financial will be as you downsize that fixed annuity
business, so it's down $4 billion in the last year. Matt is working hard to continue to downsize that business because we
don't like the returns in it. So we want our money back and that's what he's going to go do. Matt, anything you want to
add?
<A - Matthew Winter>: No, we feel confident that through some fairly sophisticated work on the asset/liability
management side and some additional work on liability governance on the in-force that we're going to be able to
maximize our potential for hitting that $1 billion figure in the required timeframe. But we're also going to use our
capital smartly and not do stupid things just to hit an artificial target. So if the interest rate environment applies pressure
on us in a way that that seems no longer the prudent thing to do, then we'll rethink that. But right now, we believe that's
still a realistic target and we still think we'll be able to achieve that.
As far as the long term impact of the interest rate environment, as I think we've said previously, most of our products
are at minimums at this point. Very few do we have additional room to lower crediting rates on. We are now spending a
lot of our time on the ALM side and bundling our liabilities based upon both duration and liquidity needs and therefore
working with the investment organization and Judy to get the proper investment mix and asset mix for each of those
groups of liabilities. And as a result, we feel pretty confident that we can do a pretty good job in the foreseeable future
in this interest rate environment. But it's undoubtedly true that if this interest rate environment persists for an extended
period of time, it will put pressure on us.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Mike, let me maybe give you an overview of what Judy is doing in the investment world
and maybe she'll want to make specific comments on it. The position we've taken in investments is a two or three-year
time horizon, so we're not trying to make trades for tomorrow, but we're looking forward two or three years. Judy and
her team, we want them to be proactive, to take action, to move ahead. But it's really on our risk and return what is the
right tradeoff. Obviously, we took some gains this quarter because we thought that was the right thing to do over the
medium term. And actually, I think it worked out quite well. Obviously, taking gains and then reinvesting, if you were
to reinvest in a like security, would mean your overall investment income would go down. But that's not the approach
we take, as Matt was pointing out. It is very much asset/liability management. Maybe Judy wants to talk a little bit
about the shift out of governments into corporates and what she has been doing to maintain yields.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: Okay, so as Tom mentioned, this year we have done quite a bit of shifting out of corporates,
out of govis, into corporates. And for the most part, we feel good about that trade. I think that probably the more
important shift that we've made this year is the curve repositioning. So if you think about – earlier this year we moved
the portfolio and moved some of our nearer-term maturities to the intermediate part of the curve. We moved some of
our longer-term maturities to the intermediate part of the curve. And because of that move, we don't have that much in
Allstate Protection that is maturing over the next 12 to 24 months. So we've already done some of that reinvest in what
was a higher interest rate environment.
So if you look at what's coming off the Allstate Protection portfolio over the next three years, it's about $3 billion in
three-year and it's about $1.5 billion in prepays, all very manageable. And in 2012, it's even more manageable in that
we're looking at significantly less, like $500 million in maturities and $600 million in prepays, and those again at fairly
decent yields in terms of being able to reinvest and not give up that much income.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: That's very helpful.

Your next question is from Matthew Heimermann from JPMorgan; your question, please.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: Hi. Good morning, everybody; first question just on auto. Given that you're
reporting some year-over-year gains in Florida and New York, I guess I'm a little surprised that year on year both in the
quarter and nine months that underlying combined ratios there look like they're sliding a little bit, so some color there.
And if you could just clarify your comment on New York and Florida being profitable, was that run rate 3Q? Just some
color on that would be great.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Matt, I don't know that I got the first part about the combined ratio sliding in other places.
Are we talking about that the results were worse in other parts of the country?
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: In aggregate you were reporting higher underlying combined ratios this year than
last year both for and for nine months. So if New York and Florida have made progress, I guess that implies other
places have gone backwards, so just some color on what is going on there.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I would start at the most macro level, Matt, and say that the returns we're getting on capital
in our auto business at the levels in all those states even where the combined ratio has gone up a little bit are great. So
we're getting really strong returns in those places, and we try to manage both overall return, return in an individual
state, and then growth and being competitive in the marketplace. So there is nothing in the auto business that concerns
me that the combined ratio is ready to head for the sky. In fact, I feel better about it because specifically New York and
Florida are in much better position.
The story is different for each state as to why do I feel better about it. One is certainly the run rate. The other is the
current rate, but then where I see us preserving when I'm looking at the pay trends. On some measure, both states are
profitable. And when I look forward, the trends I see indicate that it will continue to stay strong and in fact get better.
We're going to be stuck with a little bit of overhang on growth in those states because if you look at our decline in
items in force, 97% of it is due to those two states, so we're trying to manage growth. In the other states, early last year
we took some changes in combined ratio. We lowered rates in some places to get more competitive. And then the other
part I guess would be when you look at the quarter, I'm not sure how much. I'd look at maybe taking cats out of that
number too.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: I'm looking at underlying, so it's already adjusted out. I guess I'm just trying to put
that in context given one of the strategic and financial goals has been relative stability in those margins. So I get your
ROIC comment. I'm just trying to put it in context with that.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Matt, we're not going to let the combined ratio in auto get out of control. We're on top of it.
We watch it, every state, every rating plan. We're all over that. It's a core goal of ours. I wouldn't read into what I
would say are normal variations in the combined ratio. Frequency, you can't really predict frequency on
quarter-by-quarter or even a nine-month basis with that much accuracy, so it bounces around. It can bounce around by
a point easily decimal. We give our 88 to 91. With that in place, I feel very good that we'll continue to finish out the
year strong, and I feel good where we're headed next year as well.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: And then the second question I had was just on the corporate compensation and
governance changes that you alluded to. I guess based on how you historically have paid people in the proxy, it has
been pretty specific metrics, corporate as well as SBU. So I'm just curious when you refine compensation how we
might think about that. And then just general governance, I guess where the improvements that you're talking about
there.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: There's a whole host of things we're doing. The biggest change that we're contemplating,
and I say contemplating because it is a decision that the Board has to make and I have to work my way through with
our management team. That is using performance stock units instead of restricted stock units as part of the
compensation plan. S some governance people do not consider options to be performance based, and they'd like a
larger component of compensation to be performance based. So we're likely to use performance stock units instead of

restricted stock units for the most senior members. There will be lots of other people inside our company where
restricted stock is absolutely the right way to compensate them.
We have moved – we do have very specific measures, as you point out, much more so than other companies, though
over the last four years we've changed. That is what funds the pool. It used to be what has funded individual pay. We've
now shifted to that. It still funds to pool; we have very specific measures to fund the pool, which protects shareholders,
but then we allocate that amongst people based on their individual performance. And that's where when I started I said
one of the things we're trying to do is drive increased performance, greater sense of urgency, more accountability, and
driving results in the company. So we do that with pay and have been for the last three years, so that's a change which
we've implemented.
As it relates to other governance things, there is a whole host of items that we're considering, the largest of which is
probably a right of shareholders to act by written consent. As you may or may not know, that has been proposed as a
proxy item for us in each of the last two years. It got 52% and 55% vote of the shares that voted support for it. And
we're likely to put that forward to shareholders as something they can vote on. Then there is a host of other things,
Matt, that we've gone and looked at. What we did is we went out and listened to everybody and heard what they had to
say. And we'll adopt those things that we think meet their needs and drive what shareholders want in terms of
governance, transparency, and compensation.

Your next question from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital; your question, please.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Hi. Tom, I was hoping you could just talk a bit more about the agency consolidation, and I
guess in regards to maybe to two things. Just one, the effect on morale, especially as the compensation changes are
coming soon, and I think that has created some anxiety as well. How are you managing morale with both of those
changes?
And then two, I guess I'm a little bit confused. It seems every month or so, I see a press release about Allstate adding 25
agencies in this state, 50 agencies in that state. Why are we adding new agencies, which I'm guessing would be small,
at the same time we're trying to consolidate agencies on the top side?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Let me deal with the morale piece first as it relates to agencies. Obviously, when you
change compensation programs, it creates concern amongst people who are subject to them. That would be true for our
employees. It's true for our agency owners. It would be true for each of us individually because anytime there is a
change, your first perception is people don't want to pay you more money, they're trying to figure out how to get a
better deal for themselves. That is not true in this case. In this case, what we've said is we're going to pay out the same
amount of money. In fact, to the extent performance is better, we'd like to pay out more money. We do want to shift it
though towards those people who are doing the best job for our customers and that's how we designed the program.
The program historically has paid out about 10.7% of premiums, of which 10% was stated and 0.7% was bonus and
incentives, which we've put in place I think four or five years ago, something called RFG [Resources for Growth]
bonus, which is about $200 million to $250 million a year in terms of compensation. We put that incentive-based plan
in place four or five years ago. We like what we see in that in terms of it driving behavior. So we're working on a new
compensation plan, which is still 10.7%, but has 8% locked in and then 2.7% which is based on performance. Some of
that is very easy to do. You have to be open. You have to have a certain number of licensed sales professionals per
customer. You have to do protection. I mean, it's not that you have to have good signage. It's not like you have to jump
over the Great Wall of China to get the money. That said, some people will end up with less in this new program unless
they change their behavior and their practices, which is really driven by what the customers want.
So there are a couple options for them. One is we're trying to support them to help them get better with all kinds of
programs and efforts. Secondly, if they don't want to do that, then it would be in their interest to sell to other agencies

who do want to do it who are close to them. And so we then, as I mentioned, we'll loan agencies money to help them
buy other agencies. And we do that out of Matt's portfolio and that has worked quite well for us. Despite that, in any
change, you expect to have some people be unhappy, and there are some people who are unhappy. It's our goal to try to
make as many of them that want to be successful, successful so we can do a great job for our agencies.
As it relates to adding new agencies, we're always looking for fresh blood and talent. Just because we want the average
size to go up doesn't mean that we're not interested in having somebody come in who is entrepreneurial, who wants to
build up an agency, or somebody who wants to come in and buy an existing agency, one of the existing – they don't all
have to be consolidated amongst themselves. We're perfectly happy to have new buyers come in, buy an agency, and
take it to a new level of performance because they see it. So we're always looking for talent and capabilities. Then, of
course, there's obviously just the geographic footprint because people move around and stuff and you have holes in
your footprint. We're not as strong in the upper Midwest as we are in the urban areas along the coast because of our
history. So we obviously would like to have more agencies in those upper Midwest places where we're
underrepresented relative to our brand. Does that make sense? Mark, is there anything you want to add?
<A - Mark LaNeve>: I'd just add that we do continue to need to add what we call scratch agencies, as Tom said, in
certain geographic locations. Texas right now, which I think is an expanding market, would be a good example. We
continue to need to bring fresh talent in that's buying existing agencies as they exit out of the business or retire. We're
doing that with a much stronger selection process and capital requirement than I think we had seven or eight years ago.
As a result, we're getting much higher success rates, much higher productivity levels. So that's part of the overall plan
in addition to programs such as the loan program to have agents acquire other agents, either operate them in separate
locations or merge them together when it makes sense to increase scale so that they can serve our customers better. So
it works in concert with each other.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Ian, I'd like to make a point that the agency's success is completely tied to and important to
our success. Sometimes I think people hear some of the noise and people who are unhappy with what we're doing I
think we're at odds. Those agencies are worth billions of dollars. We want them to be worth even more than they're
worth today because if they're worth more, that means they're bigger, they're growing, they have stronger customer
relationships, which is good for us. So we're in this together. We're already in for $0.25 billion supporting them. We'll
go in for more. So this is about all of us being successful. This is not a – we're not headed into this with a fight in mind
or thinking that it's a zero sum game and we'd have to take money away from those agencies. This is about meeting our
customer needs, doing the kind of change that we need to do, which is never easy, but in competing in what's a pretty
competitive marketplace.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: That's all very fair. And I agree with most of what you're trying to do, Tom. I guess what I
was trying to figure out is just to some extent if there are some morale challenges, is that part of what's behind the new
apps declining some? Is it maybe a little bit too much too fast and it's going to hurt production for a while until things
settle down, or am I reading too much into it?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: No, I would say that the reduction in new apps as a company is on the company's
performance, not on the agencies. The agencies, it has nothing to do with them. They're working hard every day.
They're out talking to customers. We have to get a broader pricing target in auto insurance than we have today. We
need to be competitive from a technology standpoint and make sure our systems are working quickly and effectively.
We have to do good work on customer service. So I would not put that on the agencies. And it's not like they've gone
on strike or anything like that. They're busy doing other things. We need to help them. But it's the company's job to
start to drive the growth. I wouldn't put that on the agencies.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Very good, thank you. I appreciate it.

<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Good morning. I first wanted to follow up on the margins in the auto insurance. The loss ratio
ex-cats went up over 100 basis points this quarter. Was there some non-cat weather in that number?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Vinay, it's hard to tell. We do cat code, and so when it goes through a particular state and
there is catastrophe in that state, it obviously gets carved out. But then sometimes people don't report it right away.
Sometimes it's a neighboring state or a neighboring area. So I would say that frequency bounces around a little bit.
We're feeling okay about frequency this year. And importantly, our paid loss trends look good as well, so we're feeling
good about that. We were up a little bit in collision this quarter, so we changed reserves a little bit on collision. But
we're feeling good about the rest of the FPB [First Party Benefit] coverages and BI [Business Interruption] as well.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay. And on the auto insurance business, what's your targeted combined ratio for that
business?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We don't have an established countrywide target the way some of our competitors do. But
we obviously think that if you're at 96, you're still earning a good return. It's not our objective to take combined ratio on
standard auto up to 96, however. I don't want you to – but we do look at – what we want to do is maintain our margins
overall and begin to grow the business, which we think we're now in a better position to do given the progress we've
made in New York and Florida. It's not going to turn next quarter, so I don't think you should expect to see us suddenly
be growing at incredibly high rates next quarter because we've got those fixed. As you know, this business takes – the
strength of this business is 80%-plus of what we will earn over the next year we've already written. The down side to
that is it's harder to turn the overall growth side because you've got to get past those renewals.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: That's great. And on the homeowners side, for the loss cost trends are they up in the 5% to 6%
range? And if you're getting rates up say maybe about 8%, do you think you can get to your target of low 60s on loss
ratio by the end of 2013?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We're committed to getting a 13% return on equity using operating income by that period of
time. We're going to do what we need to do in homeowners to get there.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Maybe we can do one last question.

Your final question today is from Brian Meredith from UBS; your question, please.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Thank you. I just got in; two questions here for you. First one, just looking at capital
position and knowing you had to fund the Esurance acquisition in the fourth quarter, would it be a stretch to think that
you could buy stock back in the fourth quarter, or at least renew it and buy some back?
<A - Don Civgin>: Brian, I think the question you're really asking is the one Tom already addressed, which is we're
going to reexamine where we are on share repurchases in the fourth quarter. When we have something to announce,
we'll tell you then.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Okay. But the Esurance acquisition, I assume you funded that with cash.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yes.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Okay, terrific. And then the other one, I was just wondering. Tom, could you talk about the
competitive environment out there? Given we've gone through record catastrophe losses this year, has it caused any – I
know in homeowners line, obviously, people are raising rates. But on the auto insurance side, have you seen it cause
anybody to step off the accelerator at all?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: No. I have not. The three large competitors in auto insurance that we all spend a lot of time
talking about, called State Farm, Progressive, and GEICO, are all continuing to be very aggressive in the auto business,

as you can see. Just watch some football game or baseball game and you can't get away from us. That continues to be
highly competitive. You're starting to see some other companies like USAA, Farmers, Nationwide step up a little bit.
Whether they can stay in the game as advertising spend gets higher, I'm not sure. You're also starting to see the
competition shift to new products. We didn't talk much about it here. But whether that's the telematics approaches or
the products we've been launching, so you're continuing to see pretty aggressive competition amongst those big
carriers.
Brian, I can't really speak to the smaller carriers in total. But as you know, they have about half the market, and it
doesn't look like they're all of a sudden taking price increases. But they're having and increasingly difficult time to
compete on advertising and new products, which probably means they'll keep prices – try to be as competitive as they
can on prices. So I'm expecting that market to stay as competitive next year as it is this year, but it's a market we think
we can win in. We didn't have a great third quarter on new business. There were some things that happened earlier in
the year, but we feel good about what we've got going in the fourth quarter and as we head into next year.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Terrific, thank you.
