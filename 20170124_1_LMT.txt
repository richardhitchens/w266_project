Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call today. All of us here, hope your New
Year is off to a good start.
Let me begin by saying that I am extraordinarily proud of our Lockheed Martin team. Their dedication and focus
enabled us to achieve outstanding program and financial performance during a dynamic year of transition. And I want
to thank them for their efforts.
Our performance as a corporation, allowed us to exceed all of our full-year goals and has positioned us for future
growth and to continue to deliver value to customers and stockholders in 2017. While Bruce will cover the financial
results in detail a little later, I want to highlight a few noteworthy 2016 financial accomplishments from my
perspective. 2016 was an exceptional year of achievement with all of our financial metrics exceeding our expectations
and in the case of sales, earnings per share and cash from operations, exceeding our previous historical high
watermarks.
I was especially pleased with our performance and maintaining our focus on new business wins and building backlog.
We received almost $19 billion in order bookings in the fourth quarter, which resulted in our achieving a quarterly
book to bill ratio of 1.4 and a year-end backlog of over $96 billion. This represents over $1 billion increase from 2015
year-end levels and reflects the broad demand for our products from both domestic and international customers.
Significant awards included $7.2 billion for our F-35 LRIP 10 undefinitized contract action agreement a $1.5 billion
award for PAC-3 missile defense capabilities for the United States and allied military forces and $1.2 billion from the
Republic of Korea Airforce to upgrade 134 of their F-16 aircraft.
Our strong and growing backlog has positioned us to deliver (Technical Difficulty) -- sorry for the interruption there --
not here in our room. Our strong and growing backlog has positioned us to deliver expanding sales levels and
outstanding financial results as we move forward.
Another area where we are -- it seems like somebody is not on mute. Let me just continue, another area where we were
successful was our strategic focus on cash and cash deployment.
In 2016, we generated nearly $5.2 billion in cash from operations reflecting the commitment, focus of our team in
executing on contracts for our customers on a daily basis. And we expect to exceed our initial three year $15 billion
commitment we originally laid out in October of 2014 by $1 billion.
This strong cash generation also enabled us to continue our longstanding cash deployment strategy. In 2016, we
returned 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders through our competitive dividend and ongoing share repurchase
activity. Keeping with cash deployment, our 2016 share repurchases exceeded $2 billion and coupled with the shares
retired earlier in the year as part of our divestiture of the IS&GS business allowed us to reduce our year-end
outstanding share count to below our target, one full year ahead of our stated goal. These achievements reflect our
ongoing commitment to perform with excellence for our customers and stockholders.
Looking beyond 2016, our 2017 guidance outlined today shows that we are expecting solid organic growth and
continued strong cash generation. And Bruce will provide a detail review of the guidance and assumptions in his
comments and web charts.
I'd like to turn now to the status of DoD budget. Currently, the DoD is operating under a continuing resolution through
April 28th, for fiscal year 2017, with funding constrained to prior FY'16 levels. While this will cause funds to be
limited for certain DoD programs and likely delay expansion in others, we do not believe our 2017 sales, earnings or
cash flows will be affected by this delay in receiving a full appropriations bill.
We forecast that prior year's appropriation levels will support our current plans as our broad portfolio of long cycle
programs remains well aligned with our customers' needs.

Further support for this conclusion is that the continuing resolution also allows for a limited set of exceptions, which
include the ability to additionally fund two of our programs. Advanced procurement for a new multi-year Black Hawk
helicopter contract and sufficient funding to maintain the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle program, launch
capability and schedule.
While we believe the possibility of a full year CR still exist and would not be in the nation's best interest, we are
hopeful that a resolution can be reached to maintain our country's readiness and strength. Separately, the 2017 National
Defense Authorization Act, was signed into law last month and reflected bipartisan agreement that defense budgets
should not return to amounts defined by the Budget Control Act or sequestration levels.
I am personally encouraged by that fact that there is recognition from both parties that global security threats are not
decreasing, and that in fact we do need to continue to put resources toward our national security, and our
interoperability with our allies around the world.
We look forward to the upcoming submission of the new administration's budget proposal and continued congressional
support for a strong defense and future recapitalization actions, both in FY 2017 and beyond. We look forward to
working with the new Pentagon team as we collectively look to provide our armed forces with the capabilities needed
to perform their crucial missions.
I would like to continue my remarks with a few highlights from the fourth quarter that illustrate the continued upward
momentum we have in our operational performance, as we delivered daily on the commitments to our customers.
Starting with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we delivered 16 aircraft in the fourth quarter, including the first planes for
customers beyond our original 8 partner nations, Japan and Israel. These countries represent our 9th and 10th
international customers. And along with South Korea show building international interest in the capabilities of this
remarkable plane.
In November, Luke AirForce Base welcomed the arrival of its first foreign military sale or FMS aircraft, as Japan took
ownership of its first F-35, where it will be used to train an elite cadre of Japanese Air self-defense pilots and
maintainers.
In December, I traveled to Israel to attend the delivery ceremony for the first pair of Adir F-35 stealth fighters for the
Israeli Air Force. The IAF has embraced the technologies and capabilities of this 5th generation fighter, and believe it
will become a powerful accelerator for their entire Air Force.
Also during the fourth quarter, our F-35 backlog grew. As we received, an undefinitized contract for LRIP 10, which
added 90 planes to our flow. This brings our total F-35 orders-to-date up to 373 planes. Just as significantly our 2016
deliveries of 46 jets brought our total deliveries to 200 aircraft at the end of 2016. We expect 2017 to be another
inflection point in our production cycle, as we now anticipate delivering 66 planes, an increase of over 40% from our
2016 level.
As many of you know, I had the opportunity to meet with President Trump on two occasions prior to his inauguration
to discuss our F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.
We along with our partners share his strong interest in producing this unparalleled aircraft at affordable prices for our
war fighters and taxpayers. We believe we are on this path. And I'd like to take a moment to give you a quick status of
the program. At this time, I'll ask you to turn to the third page in the web charts that we have provided. This chart
depicts the F-35 A model per unit price, which is the conventional takeoff and landing or CTOL variant.
The chart also depicts the F-35 program order quantities. The bar graph portion of the chart shows our historical and
projected orders. You will also observe a dark descending line on the graph, which shows the per unit price of our
CTOL variant in each LRIP, as notated by the axis on the right.
You can see from our latest status on LRIP 9, our current F-35 A is now around $100 million a piece, and drops below
$100 million for LRIP 10. The LRIP 10 price as currently proposed would represent a reduction of over 60% from the
first LRIP 1 aircraft, and this demonstrates a learning curve, as efficient as any achieved on any modern tactical fighter

aircraft.
The chart also includes a red dotted line, which represents the government program offices annual budget estimate to
Congress of the F-35 A unit price. This selected acquisition report or SAR is submitted annually to Congress as part of
the yearly budgeting process, in advance of our contract negotiations for each lot.
As you can see, we have had eight consecutive years of achieving settlement unit prices below the internal government
expectations, showing our ongoing commitment to producing this aircraft with increasing affordability. You will also
see the rapid ascent and quantities on the chart. It is with this anticipated trajectory in production that we can continue
to see the efficiencies in touch labor, manufacturing techniques, and supply chain operations that we project will allow
us to meet our stated goal of offering the CTOL version for $85 million by 2019. We believe this will result in the best
combination of capability and price of any aircraft ever offered. While at the same time growing valuable job
opportunities for our American workforce.
Turning to our Space Systems business area, I'd like to highlight another example of one of our innovative products,
and the benefits that can be derived from our long-term commitment to technology, our customers and their missions.
In November, we successfully delivered the Lockheed Martin built GOES-R satellite to Cape Canaveral Air Force
Station in Florida. The spacecraft was launched on a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket, and placed into
geostationary orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, as the first of four in a next generation weather satellite constellation.
We are excited to be leading the GOES-R program, a collaborative mission between NASA and NOVA, which will
provide major improvements to quality, quantity, and timeliness of critical weather data. This constellation will
improve the detection and observations of meteorological events that directly affect public safety, protection of
property, and ultimately economic health.
I'm especially pleased that the Company's advanced technology center in Palo Alto, California contributed key
instrumentation that will fly aboard each spacecraft, including the Geostationary Lightning Mapper or GLM. The GLM
will take hundreds of images every second, mapping lightning activity on the earth's surface and in the atmosphere.
Scientists are hoping to use data from the GLM and GOES-R satellites to provide citizens and public safety officials
early warning of severe storms and tornado activity.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate our Sikorsky team for delivering the 1,000 H-60 M Black Hawk
helicopter this past quarter, at a ceremony in our Connecticut facility. This version of the Black Hawk dating back to
2007 has been consistently enhanced with more powerful engines, improved airframe, and modern avionics. And it is a
key element of the Army Aviation Modernization Plan. The Black Hawk has been noted as the workhorse of army
aviation. And including the entire Black Hawk family, Sikorsky has delivered over 4,000 Black Hawk helicopters,
which have flown over 9 million flight hours. We are honored to be part of this heritage and look forward to continuing
this proud legacy.
In closing, as I reflect back on our accomplishments over the past year, we completed our strategic actions to better
align the business for operational and financial success and long-term value creation. We increased sales, grew our
backlog and had strong cash generation, while continuing to perform with excellence for our customers.
Looking to the future, I am enthusiastic about our corporations broad portfolio and the growth opportunities that it
provides both domestically and internationally.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, outline our 2017 financial
guidance, and then we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Marillyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments please follow along with
the web chart we included with our earnings release today. My remarks begin on chart four, at an overview of our
financial results for the year.

Before discussing our 2016 financial results, I want to provide an understanding of the material weakness in internal
controls that we described in our earnings release. This material weakness relates to a number of deficiencies in internal
control over financial reporting and is limited to Sikorsky only.
While we've not discovered any material errors in the financial results included in our earnings release today, our views
of the internal control processes and IT-related controls over financial reporting at Sikorsky indicated a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement could have occurred that would not have been prevented or detected on a timely
basis, which is enough to determine that a material weakness in those internal controls exists.
That finding in turn triggered a more thorough review of Sikorsky's financial statements to determine whether or not
that potential for a misstatement led to an actual material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements and at
this time, we have not found that to be the case.
We expect to have completed our analysis of Sikorsky's financial statements when we file our Form 10-K in February.
Thereafter, the remediation process will continue as we'll have to correct and then test the remediated controls over
several reporting cycles. We'll provide updates on our progress as we file our Form 10-Qs in 2017 and we expect that
the remediation will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2017.
Moving on now to our 2016 results. Overall, we finished the year a little stronger than the outlook we provided to you
in the October call. We attained the highest sales, earnings per share and cash from operations that we've ever achieved.
We continued our track record of returning substantial cash to our stockholders and we grew backlog to more than $96
billion, significant (Technical Difficulty) the strong sales volume in the year. So overall, we're very pleased with our
results for 2016, and we think this positions us well as we enter 2017.
I'll add that it's also nice for me and perhaps for you as well to have the many portfolio shaping activities that occurred
during the year behind us. Hopefully, making it easier to both explain and follow the results of the Company going
forward.
Turning to chart five, we compare our sales and earnings per share in 2016 versus 2015. Sales were nearly $7 billion
higher this year compared with last year and most of that growth came from having a full year of Sikorsky performance
and results of RMS for 2016 versus less than two months in 2015. And significant organic growth in aeronautics,
driven by the F-35 program. Earnings per share grew by 25% over last year's level, driven by higher segment operating
profit and FAS/CAS adjustment.
The benefits of a lower tax rate and a lower share count due to share repurchases in the year and the results of the share
reduction associated with IS&GS divestiture.
Within the 2016 results, we also had the benefit of recognizing the book gain resulting from obtaining a controlling
interest in the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment that we discussed on the last call. That gain increased EPS by
$0.34 for the year.
Chart six, shows our actual cash from operations generated in 2016 and our outlook for 2017. During the October call,
we discussed that our cash projection in 2016 had significant variability in it driven by about 700 million in F-35
collections that could have been received in either 2016 or 2017. And we sized our 2016 cash from operations at 5
billion or 5.7 billion.
We also said that if the $700 million was not received in 2016, it would simply be added to our outlook for 2017,
resulting in a two year outlook for cash from operations of greater than or equal to $10.7 billion. As it turns out, we did
not receive the $700 million in collections in 2016, but we did generate $5.2 billion in cash from operations even
without those collections. And we are keeping our 2017 outlook at the $5.7 billion level, resulting in a two year outlook
of greater than or equal to $10.9 billion or 200 million more than we said in October.
If you'll turn to chart seven, we'll discuss the amount of cash we returned to stockholders in 2016. With our cash from
operations of around $5.2 billion and capital expenditures of almost 1.1 billion, our free cash flow in 2016 was a little
more than $4.1 billion. And with $2.1 billion of share repurchases and $2 billion of dividends paid, we returned 100%
of our free cash flow to stockholders last year.

On chart eight, you can see how our consistent focus on returning cash to our stockholders has resulted in a significant
reduction in the number of shares outstanding. We've reduced our shares outstanding by 36% from our peak share
count level of 456 million shares in 2002. And we achieved our goal of reducing outstanding shares to below 291
million shares, one year earlier than our target date. As a reminder, we anticipate $2 billion of share repurchases in
2017.
Chart nine provides our 2017 outlook. Our sales guidance is between $49.4 billion and $50.6 billion. And our segment
operating profit range is between $5.015 billion and $5.135 billion. Our FAS/CAS adjustment is $880 million for 2017,
and we'll discuss this in more detail on the next chart.
Our earnings per share are expected to be between $12.25 and $12.55. And our cash from operations is expected to be
equal to or greater than $5.7 billion as we discussed earlier, and this represents a good start to achieving the goal we
established in October of generating $15 billion or more of cash from operations during 2017 to 2019.
On chart 10, we compare the FAS/CAS adjustment outlook that we provided in October with what we're providing
now. In October, we expected an adjustment of $800 million. Since then, interest rates increased housing our discount
rate to increase to the 4.125% level by year-end, 50 basis points higher than we projected in October.
The increase in discount rate increased our FAS/CAS adjustment for 2017 by $240 million and we lowered our outlook
for the long-term return on our pension assets from 8% to 7.5% recognizing the downward pressure on the equity and
fixed income asset classes in our trust.
Lowering the long-term return on assets, lowers our FAS/CAS adjustment in 2017 by $160 million, partially offsetting
the increase resulting from the higher discount rate and netting to a FAS/CAS adjustment of $880 million for 2017.
Chart 11 provides our sales and segment operating profit outlook ranges by the four business areas. I recall a briefing
we gave in New York City at the end of 2006, where we said that the aeronautics business area would grow from its
$11 billion revenue level then to more than $20 billion by 2015. Given all that's happened since that time, reaching $20
billion in 2017 still feels like a nice accomplishment for our aeronautics team, and has enabled us to forecast 2017
revenue of $50 billion at the midpoint of our guidance.
And finally, we have our summary on chart 12. We achieved exceptional performance in 2016. We continued our cash
deployment practices and generate strong returns for our stockholders and we completed our portfolio shaping actions,
which we believe positions us for the continued long-term value creation.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Stephanie?

Thanks for the question Cai, I'll take that on and Bruce if you have anything to add, you're certainly welcome. On LRIP
10, we're very close to a deal as some of you may have seen in the media express that, after my discussions with
President Trump recently, we're very close to a deal that would allow us to close over 10 in the near term. And so, I
expect that will be very soon. On LRIP 9, basically we're not under any pressure to do anything further on LRIP 9, at
this point, we are just going to continue to look at our options on LRIP 9. Anything you want to add Bruce?
Bruce Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No, I think that captures it Marillyn.

Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ron Epstein, Analyst
Yeah, hey, good morning guys. When we (Multiple Speakers) about modeling the program, the F-35 program as we go
out over the next several years, I mean, one question I get a lot from investors. How should we think about the margin
profile is that, how should we think about the margin profile? I guess what I am asking is, one of fears is on Lot 10
pricing, I mean, are we going to see a margin step down, or I mean, can you give us a broad way to think about the
margin progression of that program?
Bruce Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Ron, I'll take a short at that. So the way I think of it, Ron, we've given I think a very consistent speech for a number of
years about our expectation that the F-35 program will have sort of sequential year-over-year margin improvement up
to the point that probably we reach full-rate production at which point it ought to look a lot like other production
programs at that sort of same stage of their lifecycle.
And, at least as I look, and with the expectation of where I think the agreement on LRIP 10 is going to come out, I don't
think we would deviate from that -- at this point in time, and just to put it in some perspective, you know, I think of the
F-35 from 2016 to 2017, the margins that we're expecting in between those two years is probably growing 90 -- not
quite a 100 basis points year-over-year. And I think that's going to happen with the results that we expect to attain on
the LRIP 10 negotiation. And thereafter, I would expect that we would continue to have some margin improvement,
maybe not as high a rate as we experienced from 2016 to 2017, but still have sequential increase in margin out through
the full rate production programs as we talked about in the past.

Marillyn and Bruce, Greg good morning. I have a question on Brexit and international. So one fallout, potential fallout
from Brexit is the impact on the UK defense spending. So, wondering if you've had any discussions with the British
government on this topic, do you expect much of an impact?
And on the topic of international, can you give us an update on discussions you're having with the international
customers. For example, how they're viewing the change in administration. Are you expecting a continued step up in
international demand? Is there any change in emphasis on direct versus FMS that sort of thing?
Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
Thanks for the question, Rich. I'll just start with the Brexit question. And in terms of UK defense spending, I haven't
had any impact -- input from the UK MoD that they're going to move off of their strategic defense plan. They have a
strategy in their normal review that they will continue to spend on their defense spending. So we haven't seen any
impact from that, no indication that that's going to change. I think just like most countries, the national security is first
and foremost for them, and so they're going to continue to focus on that.
In terms of other international customers and any reaction to the change in administration? Frankly, haven't had any
dialog back from that as well. We -- as we bring in, as we have an orderly transition of power in the United States of
America, and we have new leaders in the administration, they each -- they have different policies, they might put
forward, but it hasn't impacted our demand for our international products.
Lot of our growth on international, and the international marketplace is in the F-35, it's in missile defense, it's in
opportunities for F-16 and C-130J opportunities for C4ISR space awareness. Things of that nature and that continues or
continues to be a demand for those. And as I -- as we continue to move forward in dealing with our international
customers, we're not seeing any retrenchment at all.
Bruce Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Rich, you asked about FMS and/or direct commercial sale and whether there is any discussions about potentially
changing that or not, my suspicion is, that's not high on anyone's agenda list at this point in time, and I wouldn't expect
to see any sort of policy changes towards that.
Just to put it in some perspective as we talked about in the past, we would expect our FMS percentage of our
international sales to grow in our direct commercial sale percentage of our international business to shrink over time.
Primarily, simply because of the F-35 program, that program is a long way from ever having the ability to sell any
aircraft on a direct commercial basis and essentially all the international customers and all the growth that you're going
to see from those international customers, and the program going forward is going to be on the FMS side of the house.
And the same thing frankly is happening with our bad THAAD program, which is another large international grower.
So that sort of squeezing out, if you will, the actual direct commercial sale. But actually direct commercial sale
business isn't shrinking in absolute terms all that much, but the percentage is reducing because of what I just described.

Robert Stallard, Analyst
Thank you so much. Good morning. Marillyn and Bruce, your comments on the F-35 program, essentially seem to
suggest that nothing is really changing within the press we seem to see the DoD and the President taking a more
aggressive stance. Is there a chance you are being too optimistic on this and the actual pricing on Lot 10 and beyond,

and the margin could be lower than you expect?
Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
Let me take that on since I've been in a lot of those discussions with President Trump. Let me just kind of frame it for
you, I've tried to express after those meetings, some overview of the meetings themselves. But I'll just give you a little
bit more color on it. Basically, President Trump recognizes that the F-35 is a very large program, it's the largest
program in the Department of Defense. He wants to make sure that the American taxpayer is getting the lowest possible
cost on the program.
And we share -- we understand its concerns about affordability. We certainly share that, the meetings that we've had
have been very productive, very good dialog. He asked excellent questions. And he is really focused on making sure
that the cost comes down on the program. And it's not about slashing our profit, it's not about our margins when we
have those discussions, it's about, how do we get the cost of the aircraft down today and in the future?
So, I have welcomed the opportunity to talk to him, because it gives me an opportunity to share with him what we have
been doing, in terms of bringing the cost down as you saw on the chart that we put in our deck today, that we have been
driving the cost down on the program, that we have invested as ourselves and our industry partners and what's called
blueprint for affordability, and we are moving forward on a sustainment cost reduction initiatives.
So that we can continue to take cost out of the supply chain, to take cost out of our manufacturing and producibility and
materials we use, as we've moved along on this program. And, as we've done that, we've -- I've also had the opportunity
to share with him, things that the Department of Defense can do. And how they might buy the aircraft differently in the
future that would help continue to drive the cost down. He welcomed that discussion.
The other thing that's very important that I'm happy to have had the opportunity to chat with him about is the
capabilities that the F-35 brings to our men and women in uniform. I mean, it's basically a game changer it brings for
our country, for our military, as well as for our allies around the world unmatched capability. Absolutely unmatched.
And recognizing that, his focus is on how do we drive the cost down aggressively. And I think we're -- us along with
our industry partners are right in line with him on doing that. We've got a lot of ideas on how we can do that in the
future.
In the meantime, we will continue on the current negotiations to come down that curve that you saw on the chart that
we shared with you, to continue to drive the cost down.

Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Hunter Keay, Analyst
Thank you. Marillyn, just a follow-up to that last statement you made on the sustainment cost. Are you talking about an
incremental initiative here to reduce, maybe some sustainment spending, or is there may be an opposite way to think
about that, you manage this program for the next 10 years to 15 years for Lockheed that you can lower the unit cost, but
perhaps maybe you recoup some of those, sort of those, upfront unit cost savings for DoD with actually higher
sustainment revenues for you guys further down the road. How are you thinking about that balance?
Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
Well, first of all what I was discussing was the sustainment cost reduction initiative just like on blueprint for
affordability, which was focused on production cost we along with Northrop Grumman and BAE committed some

investment upfront to help with getting projects underway that would continue to drive the cost down in production
which similarly invested upfront to support the US government in driving sustainment cost down in the near term over
the next five years to drive that cost down.
So, that was what I was referring to. Now your question about sustainment itself, I mean we do look at these programs
in terms of their overall lifecycle cost, which is not just the development and production, but it's also sustainment and
our goal is that the overall cost for the program would continue to come down.
Bruce Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hunter, maybe just to add one thing from my perspective and just to make sure that we're all clear on this, sustainment
is going to grow in the future, it has grown very significantly in last few years as the aircraft is being based at various
locations around the US, and soon to be internationally as well. So there is no doubt that sustainment will grow and the
Lockheed Martin contribution towards that sustainment will grow into the future. This is about just doing sustainment
smartly and doing it as economically as we can. But even if we do it as economically as we can, we're still are going to
see some pretty significant sustainment growth in the future.

Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Sam Pearlstein, Analyst
Good morning. Talk a little bit about the backlog being $96 billion. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about
what your expectations are for 2017 year-end backlog and maybe highlight some of the key orders you are looking at.
There was some international THAAD that didn't happen in '16, and just if you can talk a little bit about some of the
key orders to watch.
Bruce Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, so thanks Sam, there is -- you know as we look at 2017 in all likelihood, we're probably going to see a little bit of
degradation in backlog, I would think, maybe you know a couple of million bucks or so for the year, some of that is
obviously dependent on, there is a couple of fairly good size competitive awards in 2017, that may or may not happen
or may -- at least may not happen in the year and in fact we may or may not win some of the proposals, if you will.
The biggest drivers, we've got, in terms of orders and sort of keeping the backlog level as to where it is today or a little
bit less than where it is today, you should think of that the ongoing advanced funding for the F-35 program, so very,
very early in the first half of this year. We should start receiving advance funding for, you know the LRIP 12 aircraft,
which will be a pretty good size increase in terms of the absolute number of aircraft LRIP 11.
As we just talked about with Hunter, the sustainment and spares funding to support the basis around the country and the
globe is going to be increased in the first half of the year. We should start seeing additional GPS 3 satellite orders first
half of the year and probably finalize the Hellfire order that didn't quite get finished last year, and I expect that will take
place early this year.
The really big orders in the year are the LRIP 11 definitization for F-35 that's as we are assuming in the numbers that
we're going to get both LRIP 10 negotiated definitized and LRIP 11 negotiated definitized in 2017. We've already
recognized a pretty good portion of the LRIP 10 contract via the UCA that Marillyn talked about, but not so much on
the LRIP 11. So a big, big chunk of our orders in 2017 is associated with that definitization.

You mentioned the International missile defense programs I believe, the largest one we're looking forward and against
the second half of the year is the THAAD Qatar program. So the first buy of a THAAD battery for the government of
Qatar is also a fairly large order in the second half.
And then lastly, and I believe this is actually the second largest order for the corporation in 2017, but we do expect to
close on the multi-year nine Black Hawk order in the second half of this year as well.

Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Howard Rubel, Analyst
Thank you very much. Marillyn, you've gone through a number of significant changes in the last 12 months. And you
indicated, you and Bruce are going to be back to living a little bit more with normal. But could you for a moment step
back and talk a little bit about where are some of the competitive advantages you see and how you'd like to shape the
Company going forward? 25% of the Company is F-35, but you do have a lot of other programs and a lot of other
technology opportunities.
Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
Thanks for the question, Howard. As I said in my prepared remarks on the front end, I think we're extremely well
positioned for long-term success. Yes, last year was a challenging year in terms of transitioning you know the
divestiture of IS&GS and really moving very far along in our integration of Sikorsky and, that I would say a great
tribute to the team is that despite those major efforts that we had going on in the business, we exceeded all of our
financial commitments as well as actually hit some new records.
I mean, I think that's a true measure and our operational performance was outstanding in terms of how we're
performing for our customers, so I'm extremely pleased with that. In terms of strategically as we look forward, you
know as having Sikorsky as part of our Company now, it opens up a lot of opportunities for us. We're currently in the
development phase for a number of helicopter programs, so they're going to move into production. So as you look at
the CH-53K, the presidential helicopter, the work we've been doing on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program, the
combat rescue helicopter that we're working, all of those programs, as well as, what Bruce mentioned moving --
continuing on with the Black Hawk and getting into the next multi-year.
Black Hawk is excellent growth area for us that will continue to bring good cash generation and continued growth for
us as a Company. And then we do expect at some point the commercial business will come back. We're at a lull right
now with the oil and gas prices, but it's another opportunity for growth for us and one of the elements of the Company
that we look forward to continuing to grow.
And so, Sikorsky has been a great asset that we brought into the Company and I see great growth opportunities.
We've talked about F-35 at length, you can see, certainly it is the growth engine for our Company and we continue to
see growing international demand for it. So it's not just the program of record that we have with the US government on
the services that are buying the aircraft, but -- and the international partners that are already signed up, but many other
countries are showing interest in the program.
And then across the portfolio from our missile defense to the work we're doing in Mission Systems and Training to all
the elements of our Fire Control Capabilities, our Space Systems and Satellites and Spacecraft. I think, if you look
holistically at our portfolio, we are very strong in all of those areas and represent a leader in virtually every one of those
markets.

So from a competitive advantage standpoint, I think our goal is to continue to perform with excellence on the programs
that we have today and to continue to look for opportunities to keep our portfolio relevant, to continue to invest in
research and development and innovation so that we stay on the forefront.
I think, innovation for us is the lifeblood of this Company. What we're doing in our independent research and
development, what we're providing to our current customers and what we're looking at providing for long-term
investments for the long-term and things like hypersonics and directed energy and other things.
And then as you're probably aware, we've set up a venture fund where we're also taking positions in companies that we
see as another seeding of our innovation into our Company.
I would lastly say that, from a competitive advantage standpoint, my view is that, that it is the talent in this Company,
that is, the competitive advantage we have -- we have the best talent in the industry in my view from -- and that in my
view sets us apart. So that coupled with the technology and the outstanding portfolio I think sets us very well for
continued success and continued growth.

Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Myles Walton, Analyst
Thanks. Marillyn, it sounds like border taxation was discussed during your meeting yesterday with other business
leaders, and I'm just curious as it applies to your own business and to the defense landscape do you have a sense as to, a
clear sense as to how this is going to impact your business in the sector? Does it sound like the President is a supporter
of no tax on exports? And could you just describe how it would impact in fact Lockheed the way you see it today?
Thanks.
Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
Thanks for the question, Myles, and I guess I would step back from his comments yesterday and what you've heard
from him, and his campaign is that, his focus is on not having work go offshore to be produced and then brought back
into the United States. And, you know, and have the company have the advantage of producing it elsewhere.
So, if you take it to Lockheed Martin, I mean, we are not, we produce our products in the US, predominantly of our
roughly 98,000 -- 97,000, 98,000 employees, over 90,000 of them are here in the US, this is where we produce our
products, and then we deliver them around the world. And those that are producing in other parts of the world whether
it's in the UK, or in Canada, or Australia, the work that we might be doing there is not being imported back into the US.
So I don't see that this border taxation issue affects us as a company. And I think it's more geared toward commercial
companies that might decide to do the production offshore and then sell their products back into the US.
Bruce Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Maybe Myles just to add it from my perspective. So, anytime you're talking about reducing taxes on exports where we
have a fairly good amount of exports, and we don't frankly import a whole lot. So we would probably be a net benefiter
from a tax perspective relative to if that were to happen. I think, if you look at either one of the tax proposals are sort of
being tossed around, the current one you just discussed as well as the one that the house put forward later -- earlier,
excuse me, middle part of last year or so.
In virtually either one of those scenarios, the statutory rate drops pretty significantly and for Lockheed Martin, the US
domiciled company with most of our income as Marillyn said, coming from US locations. We don't have the sort of

Hey, good morning, everyone.
Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
Good morning.
Bruce Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Noah.
Noah Poponak, Analyst
Marillyn, I wanted to ask if you could maybe provide a little more detail or I guess thought around the total US defense
budget commentary you touched on briefly in your prepared remarks. I mean, I guess, where would you pin the actual
likelihood that sequestration is removed from DoD versus the need to have some kind of compromise where they I
guess still, I guess I'm not as sure, but still seemingly still deficit-focused Congress?
And if this is happening will we see it in the '18 request or does the administration need another year to have -- to have
it be fully their own and be prepared to do that?
Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
Thanks for the question, Noah. I guess, I will just give you my opinion, because that's really all I can do at this point,
it's pretty unpredictable as we go forward, and as you indicated. My opinion is though that, there appears to be
bipartisan support for eliminating sequestration. As I've said in the past, we have a lot of independent dialogs with
various members of Congress. Everyone I've ever spoken to has told me that they don't think it's good policy, and they
want to get rid of it.
So I think now with the current Congress and the new administration that it probably opens up the opportunity for
really getting that done. And I'm very encouraged that the dialog has been around, eliminating the defense sequester,
just removing it altogether. And there is also a strong discussion around increasing defense spending. Because we have
for the last few years allowed our -- with the budget caps etcetera, we have not been investing like we need to and
recapitalization, and readiness and a lot of things that you hear directly from our customers or services telling Congress
and telling the new administration that they need.
So we're very supportive of our defense customers and being a voice around that, because we do think it's important to
eliminate the sequester and the budget caps associated with it to allow them to do to address the national security
strategies and to provide the right capability for our men and women in uniform.

In term of where it might come into play, I mean, again, I am encouraged by the fact that there is some discussion
around the supplemental to the FY'17 budget. There is some discussions around getting after this whole issue of
sequester and eliminating the budget cap. So, whether it's in '18 -- in the '18 request or in the early '17, it's hard for me
to predict. But I think it'd be near-term than longer-term, because everyone that I speak to has recognized and certainly
President Trump has recognized that it's something that needs to go away and that we need to get on with spending the
appropriate amount, having adequate budget to support our national security.

Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.
Jason Gursky, Analyst
Good morning everyone. Bruce, Marillyn, I was wondering if you wouldn't do us a favor and walk through each of the
segments. And maybe to provide a little bit of color on the risks and opportunities this year relative to your official
outlook?
Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
Thanks, Jason. Bruce, why don't I let you walk through and then if I have anything to add I'll --
Bruce Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, let me do that. And Jason, if I don't quite capture what you're looking for, get back and shout out at me there. But
maybe just starting with Aeronautics, largest business obviously in the portfolio. So, on the sales side, we're expecting
sequential growth quarter-over-quarter. So, fourth quarter will be the highest quarter of the year, first quarter as is
typical within Aeronautics will be the lowest quarter of the year.
From sort of the comparison to 2016, I would expect sort of the rate of growth or the percentage of growth over '16 to
sort of diminish a little bit, as we go through the year, even though the numbers will get bigger. And that's in part,
because we're going to see a little bit -- the F-16 program comes to an end in the late second quarter or early third
quarter. This is the last eight aircraft deliveries that we have in backlog right now, and until we get another country to
buy the F-16, that will be the last of those production aircraft. So that's going to be a little bit lower in the second half
of the year than the first half. But still pretty significant growth quarter-over-quarter for Aeronautics. And obviously,
most of that driven by the F-35 program.
I think EBIT during the year, probably follows the sales volume as we look at least right now pretty consistent margins
quarter-over-quarter. That obviously is depended upon when we have the timing of risk retirements occurring
throughout the year. But with the planned risk retirements we have and the outlook right now, it says that the margins
are fairly consistent going throughout the year.
Maybe jumping to Missiles and Fire Control, expect the first quarter to be, maybe a little bit lower than perhaps you're
expecting the first quarter is going to be quite a bit lower than the rest of the other three quarters of the year. You
should think of that as the timing of deliveries that had both, and especially if you're comparing it to the fourth quarter
of 2016, we had a lot more deliveries in the second half of 2016, than we expect to see in the first quarter of 2017. And
so, that drop off you'll notice I think when we come out with our results at the end of the first quarter.
The next three quarters are quite a bit higher than the fourth quarter, and they're actually pretty consistent as we look at
the outlook right here for the next year or so. Low in the first quarter, the next three much higher and the next three
fairly consistent with each other. Similar to Aeronautics, the EBIT -- it kind of follows the sales volume because we do

expect a fairly consistent margin between quarters in 2017.
Rotary and Mission Systems, 2017 kind of similar to Aeronautics, we do expect sequential growth quarter-over-quarter.
Probably, also EBIT tracking to sales, but we also expect that the margin quarter-over-quarter will increase. So we'll
see some increases as we go throughout the year within the margins within RMS. And this is a little bit of the wind
down of some of the purchase accounting and intangible amortization realization, but the integration cost associated
with Sikorsky, as well as the timing of some of our planned risk retirements in 2017, causing that effect.
And then lastly, Space in 2017 actually, almost draw a straight line across the quarters roughly $2.2 billion thereabouts
every single quarter of the year is what we're expecting. There is no commercial launches or commercial satellites with
sales that we would book upon delivery like we had in 2016. We actually had two commercial launches all in the year,
and we have zero plan for this year. So you won't kind of see the spike associated with those deliveries as we saw in
2016 so a little more consistent there. EBIT again kind of follows sales volume, there is probably a little more
variability than that and that is really associated with the timing of equity earnings as we progress throughout the year.
So, hopefully that captures it in terms of how we look at that, obviously, as we look at the year, and I always give this
speech at the start of -- it seems like every year. That's based on the opportunities that are built into our plan.
And as I always like to say, as we look at the opportunities in 2017 and compare those to what we saw in 2016, the
potential for doing better is about the same as what we saw in 2016 or for that matter 2015, but we have to make that
happen in 2017 for that to come to fruition. And, again, that's not in the numbers of the planning that we just talked
about to you. Stephanie, I believe, we have time for one more question.

Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of cleanup things on F-35. Marillyn, if we go back to the
sustainment discussion, in your discussion, in your negotiations with DoD on LRIP 10 and on anything else, has there
been any consideration to defer future competition for either F-35 sustainment or for the Block 4 subsystem upgrade
work? And Bruce, how is this potential competition contemplated in your long-term outlook for the aircraft? And then
the last thing I wanted to ask you is how important is the 450 unit international block buy to the margin growth cadence
that you described to Ron earlier?
Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
Thanks for the question Rob, I guess the first question on sustainment, sustainment is a separate contract from the LRIP
10, so it isn't part of the discussion at all in the LRIP 10 negotiations, nor would be the upgrade work for Block 4 going
forward.
Robert Spingarn, Analyst
But might they factor into any horse-trading or anything that you all are talking about?

Rob, let me try to jot it down your questions, hopefully I captured them well, but as far as the future competition for
sustainment Block 4, you know, if that happens and look competition is the buzzword that everyone talks about these
days. We're not afraid of competition. We think the legacy of performance that we've had, both with the software
development on the program as well as what we've done so far in the sustainment and we -- what we plan to do with as
Marillyn said, some of the cost reduction initiatives on sustainment, we think we're incredibly well-positioned in both
of those, if in fact they are competed and our assumption would be that we would win those competitions and that is
what's embedded in our planning, if you will.
I think you also asked about the block buy and importance of the 450 aircraft potential block buy relative to margins,
not so much benefit on the margins that we're contemplating Rob as much as helping secure long-term commitments
from suppliers, long-term planning for our own work inside our own factory such that we can hopefully get and with
the benefits as sort of an economic order quantity associated with that block buy that we can get the price of the
aircraft, or the cost of the aircraft down just as what Marillyn's talked about relative to her conversations with the
President.
I mean, that is one of the items that was addressed in those conversations is, what can we and the government do to get
the cost of the aircraft down. And that is clearly one of the things that can do that. You get -- if you look at any sort of
multi-year or block buy or economic order quantity, there are always savings associated with that. The only question is,
how much are those savings and we think we have a very good plan in place relative to the block buy to bring the cost
down going forward.
But, I wouldn't expect that expectation on our part, the lower cost would be sort of priced in to that block buy, if you
will. So, I wouldn't expect to see necessarily a margin spike associated with that.
Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO
So, with that -- with our last question, let me conclude the call today. And I want to end up the call by just reiterating
that 2016 was truly an extraordinary year of transition and success. And our team performed exceptionally well in all
phases strategically, operationally and financially. As we look into 2017, our strong backlog and solid portfolio have
the corporation positioned for a bright future of top line growth and increasing cash flows. Thank you again for joining
us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you at our next earnings call in April. Stephanie, that concludes
our call today.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and everyone have a
great day.
