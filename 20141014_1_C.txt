factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings
including, without limitation, the risk factors section of our 2013 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
Michael L. Corbat
Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the third quarter of
2014. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, net income was $3.7 billion or $1.15 per share. Before I address the quarter
I'd like to discuss the actions we announced regarding Global Consumer Banking.
As you know, we're committed to simplifying our company and allocating our finite resources to the business where we
can generate the best returns for our shareholders. Consistent with these priorities, we intend to exit our consumer
businesses in 11 markets, among them Japan, Egypt, and Peru. We'll continue to serve our institutional clients in these
markets which remain important to our global network.
While these consumer franchises have real value, we didn't see a path for meaningful return. We believe our consumer
business will achieve stronger performance by focusing on the countries where our scale and network provide a
competitive advantage. Sales processes are already underway in most of these markets, and I expect these actions to be
substantially completed by the end of 2015. At that point, we'll have reduced our consumer footprint by 19 markets
since 2012 and Global Consumer Banking will be serving 57 million clients across 24 markets.
I'd also like to address the announcement we issued earlier this morning regarding our legacy Banamex unit, which
provided personal security and protective services. While the fraud is not financially material in light of the conduct we
found and in the interest of transparency, we thought it was best to inform you. As you know, we've been reviewing our
franchise in Mexico and have already made meaningful changes to strengthen our processes and controls, and we'll
continue to take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that every part of our global franchise lives up to the
standards all of us rightfully expect.
Now turning to the quarter, we achieved solid performance across our Institutional businesses, both Banking and
Markets saw improved revenue from prior-year period, assisted by a better trading environment and a strong M&A
pipeline. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues increased slightly despite spread compression.
Global Consumer Banking had a strong quarter as well and saw loan growth throughout the regions. In North America,
we had revenue improvement in each of our businesses both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year while we continued to
optimize our branch network. Internationally, we saw revenue improvements across every region compared to the third
quarter of last year.
Overall, these results show solid business performance which has helped increased Citigroup net income by 5%
year-to-date over 2013. We also continue to be focused on reducing the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings and
consuming DTA. These have been execution priorities and we, again, made progress on both fronts.
In Citi Holdings we closed the sales of our consumer businesses in Greece and Spain, which helped reduce assets
during the quarter by 7% to $103 billion. Holdings assets now constitute only 5% of Citigroup's balance sheet.
The Holdings profit of $272 million again helped drive DTA consumption. We utilized $700 million of DTA in the
quarter, bringing the total to over $5 billion for the last seven quarters. This contributed to our generating nearly $4
billion of regulatory capital this quarter and growing our Tier 1 common ratio to 10.7%. Our tangible book value also
increased to $57 73.
While we're pleased with our ability to generate capital, we're equally focused on our ability to return it to our
shareholders. During the quarter we continued to make progress on our efforts to strengthen our capital planning
process. Most important, our capital planning process is being fully embedded in the way we run the firm. This must
impact everything from increased business engagement and enhancements to our forecasting models and scenario
design processes, all of which lead to an improved approach to risk and controls. This work will continue as we get

closer to receiving the 2015 stress test scenario from the Fed, at which point we'll prepare a strong submission which
reflects the work that has been done.
As we finished out 2014, we're very mindful of the challenging macroenvironment, geopolitical tensions, uneven
growth and concerns over the timing of interest rate increases have increased volatility while the economy in the U.S.
seems to be slowly gaining strength, the Eurozone is not yet in growth mode and emerging market growth has slowed.
While our expense reduction efforts have been productive, we continue to face pressure related to legal costs and the
need to invest in regulatory and compliance as well as the critical need to protect our network from cyber crime. We'll
remain vigilant along each of these fronts to ensure the safety and soundness of our institution.
John will now go through the deck and then we'd be happy to take your questions. Thank you. John?
John C. Gerspach
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me briefly review the results of the quarter, and then I'll go into
more detail on the strategic actions we announced earlier today.
To start, I'd like to highlight two items that affect the comparability of this quarter's results to prior periods. First,
CVA/DVA was a negative $371 million pre-tax or $228 million after-tax this quarter, including a $474 million
one-time charge due to the implementation of funding valuation adjustments related to certain derivatives. Together,
these charges had a negative impact on EPS of $0.08 per share this quarter, similar to the CVA/DVA charge last year.
And secondly, last year, we recorded a tax benefit of $176 million or $0.06 per share related to the resolution of certain
tax audit items. Adjusting for these items, we earned $1.15 per share in the recent quarter compared to $1.02 per share
in the third quarter of last year. Throughout today's presentation I will be discussing our results excluding these items to
provide comparability to prior periods.
On slide 4 we show total Citigroup results. We earned $3.7 billion in the third quarter, a 13% increase from last year.
Pre-tax earnings of $5.9 billion grew 28% driven by revenue growth and lower credit costs partially offset by an
increase in operating expenses mostly driven by higher legal and repositioning charges. However, our tax rate was
higher this quarter at 36% reflecting a higher level of non-tax deductible legal accruals versus last year as well as
higher tax costs related to the sales of our consumer operations in both Greece and Spain.
On a year-to-date basis, we generated positive operating leverage with modest revenue growth and flat expenses and
our return on assets improved to 83 basis points. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew slightly
year-over-year to $654 billion as 4% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings.
And deposits were flat at $943 billion.
On slide 5, we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related and repositioning costs totaled over $1.3 billion in the
third quarter mostly incurred in Citicorp. We also incurred $59 million of operating expenses related to the sales of our
consumer operations in Greece and Spain this quarter.
Excluding these items, core operating expenses of nearly $11 billion in the third quarter increased by roughly $100
million versus prior periods, primarily reflecting an adjustment to incentive compensation expense driven by better than
anticipated performance year-to-date in our institutional franchise. Higher regulatory and compliance costs including
those related to CCAR and the impact of business growth were more than offset by continued cost reduction initiatives
as well as the decline in Citi Holdings' assets.
We expect to incur an incremental $150 million to $175 million of costs in full year 2014 as we work to enhance our
capital planning process. We estimate that about one third of that amount will be nonrecurring. In 2014, the incremental
CCAR related costs will be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. In the third quarter, we spent an
incremental $60 million related to the CCAR process and we expect this amount to increase further in the fourth
quarter.

On slide 6, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp's pre-tax earnings grew 13% as higher
revenues across the franchise and lower credit costs were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Citicorp
expense growth was mostly driven by higher legal and repositioning costs, the adjustment to incentive compensation in
ICG, and higher regulatory and compliance costs partially offset by efficiency savings.
In Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter with over $270 million in net income compared to a loss of over
$100 million last year driven primarily by lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $103
billion of assets or 5% of total Citigroup assets.
Before I go into more detail on Citicorp, I'd like to cover the strategic actions Mike discussed earlier, which will
streamline and simplify our consumer operations. We are exiting our consumer operations in 11 markets plus our
consumer finance business in Korea. As you can see on slide 7, these actions include markets across Latin America,
Asia and EMEA. Substantially, all of these operations were previously classified as optimized markets in our country
bucketing framework and while we have made steady progress in many of these businesses, we ultimately determined
that our scale did not provide for meaningful returns.
We already have active sales processes underway for over half of the businesses and we currently expect the strategic
actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2015. We intend to report these consumer operations as part of Citi
Holdings as of the first quarter. We will continue to serve our institutional clients in these countries, which remain
important to our global network.
On slide 8, we provide details on the financial impact of these actions, showing Citicorp on the left and consumer –
Global Consumer Banking on the right. Over the last 12 months, these businesses contributed over $1.6 billion of
revenues and $34 million of net income. Total assets were $29 billion as of the end of the third quarter, including $7
billion of consumer loans, and total deposits were $26 billion. As shown on the far right, on a pro forma basis, our
Global Consumer Banking business would continue to capture more than 95% of our existing revenue base, while
further simplifying our operations and improving our performance.
Now turning back to the third quarter, on slide 9, we show actual results for International Consumer Banking in
constant dollars. Net income grew 22% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by higher revenues and lower credit
costs, partially offset by higher legal and repositioning charges. Revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the third quarter,
driven by continued volume growth across the franchise with average loans of 5% and average deposits of 3%, a
rebound in investment sales revenues in Asia, and a reduced impact from our repositioning efforts in Korea.
Core operating expenses, excluding legal and repositioning costs, were roughly flat, as ongoing efficiency savings
offset the impact of business growth as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs. International Credit costs
declined 13% year-over-year, driven by a net loan loss reserve release in the current quarter, while the net credit loss
rate remained broadly favorable at just under 200 basis points.
Slide 10 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Net income grew 33% year-over-year this quarter,
driven by higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and continued favorable credit trends. Total revenues were up 5%
year-over-year. Retail Banking revenues of $1.2 billion grew 9% from last year, reflecting continued volume growth
and abating spread headwinds, as well as a mortgage repurchase reserve release of roughly $50 million this quarter.
Branded cards revenues of $2.1 billion were up 1% versus last year as we grew purchase sales, and an improvement in
spreads mostly offset the impact of lower average loans. And, Retail Services revenues grew 8% from last year, mostly
driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.
Ongoing cost reduction initiatives drove total operating expenses down slightly year-over-year to $2.4 billion, even
after absorbing the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition and higher legal and repositioning expenses. We
continued to resize our North America Retail Banking business in the third quarter, taking costs out of our mortgage
operations and rationalizing the branch footprint, all while continuing to grow our franchise.
Over the past 12 months, we have sold or closed nearly 90 branches in North America. During the same period, we
grew average retail loans by 9% and average deposits by 2%, including 10% growth in checking account balances. We
also continued to see momentum in branded cards. While total average loans have continued to decline modestly, this

mostly reflects the runoff of promotional rate balances. Full rate balances have grown year-over-year for six
consecutive quarters, and we continue to see strong growth in accounts and purchase sales in our proprietary rewards
and travel co-brand products. We also launched our Double Cash Card this quarter, which rounds out our product
portfolio in the important Cash Back segment.
Slide 11 shows our Global Consumer Credit trends in more detail. Overall, Global Consumer Credit trends remained
favorable in the third quarter, with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving as a percentage of loans. In
North America, the NCL rate continued to improve while 90-plus day delinquent rates were flat. Asia remains stable.
And in Latin America, we saw a modest uptick in the NCL rate while the delinquency rate improved slightly. Net credit
losses grew broadly in line with our expectations in the third quarter, driven by portfolio growth and continued
seasoning in the Mexico cards portfolio as well as the impact of both slower economic growth and fiscal reforms in that
market.
However, our overall loan growth was slower than anticipated which had a negative impact on the NCL rate for the
quarter. This slower loan growth reflected the overall economic environment as well as a higher level of prepayments
in our mortgage portfolio. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect the dollar amount of net credit losses in Latin
America to be more or less stable.
Slide 12 shows the expense and efficiency trends for Global Consumer Banking on a trailing 12-month basis. While
annual expenses increased in late 2012 and early 2013, driven in part by higher North America mortgage activity, we
have driven down the core expense base over the past five quarters even as we have absorbed the impact of higher
expenses associated with the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. Including roughly $800 million of legal and repositioning
charges over the past year, our total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer Banking was 56%.
Slide 13 shows our total consumer expenses over the past five quarters, split between core operating expenses and legal
and repositioning costs. Core expenses continued to decline on a sequential basis in the third quarter as we made further
progress towards our year-end goals for head count reduction, card product simplification, and branch and support site
rationalization.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 14, net income grew 29% year-over-year driven by higher
revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Revenues of $8.7 billion grew 13% from last year and 2%
sequentially. Total Banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 11% from last year and were down 3% from the prior
quarter. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 1% year-over-year as growth in fees and volumes
was partially offset by spread compression. Sequentially, revenues declined 2%, driven by lower trade assets and
spreads.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 32% from last year, driven by strong M&A and equity
underwriting activity and down 7% from the prior quarter as continued momentum in M&A was more than offset by
seasonally lower underwriting volumes.
Private Bank revenues of $663 million grew 8% from last year as growth in client volumes was partially offset by the
impact of spread compression. Corporate Lending revenues were $442 million, up 17% from last year, reflecting
growth in average loans and improved funding costs, partially offset by lower loan yields, and down 3% from last
quarter on lower gains from asset sales.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.3 billion grew 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Fixed
Income revenues of $3 billion grew 5% from last year, driven by strength in securitized products as well as an increase
in foreign exchange volatility and volumes, which benefited our rates and currencies business in the month of
September.
Sequentially, Fixed Income revenues were down slightly as a seasonal decline in spread product revenues was mostly
offset by strength in rates and currencies. Equities revenues of $763 million grew 14% year-over-year, driven by
improved client activity in derivatives and were up 16% sequentially on better trading performance.

In Securities Services, revenues grew 8% year-over-year, driven by an increase in client balances and activity. Total
operating expenses of $5 billion grew 3% over prior periods, driven by the compensation adjustment, higher regulatory
and compliance costs, and higher repositioning charges, partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings.
On slide 15, we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. On a trailing 12-month basis, the
efficiency ratio declined to 59% this quarter despite continued elevated legal and repositioning charges. And our comp
ratio for the last 12 months was 28%, down from 29% last quarter.
Slide 16 shows the results for Corp/Other. Revenues declined year-over-year driven mainly by hedging activities while
expenses increased on higher legal and related expenses as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs, including
those related to the CCAR process. Assets of $332 billion included approximately $97 billion of cash and cash
equivalents and $180 billion of liquid investment securities.
Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings' assets, which totaled $103 billion at quarter-end, with over 60% in North America
mortgages. Total assets declined $8 billion during the quarter, driven by net paydowns and divestitures including the
sales of our consumer operations in both Greece and Spain.
On slide 18, we show Citi Holdings' financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.6 billion were up
year-over-year primarily driven by gains on the sales of our consumer operations in both Greece and Spain and lower
funding costs, partially offset by losses on the redemption of debt used to fund Holdings' assets. Citi Holdings'
expenses decreased significantly, driven by the lower level of assets as well as lower legal and related costs, partially
offset by $59 million of episodic expenses related to the sales of our consumer operations in Greece and Spain.
Net credit losses continued to improve, down 45% year-over-year, driven by North America mortgages, and we offset
all of the mortgage net credit losses with loan loss reserve releases. The net loan loss reserve release of $144 million
includes the impact of roughly $75 million of losses on assets moved to held for sale this quarter. Excluding these
losses, the reserve release would have been close to $220 million.
On slide 19, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Our net interest margin improved to 291 basis
points in the third quarter reflecting lower cost of funds. Looking to the fourth quarter, given the sale of consumer loans
with attractive margins in Greece and Spain, we could see our net interest margin decline by a basis point or two.
On slide 20, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter our Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio grew to 10.7%,
driven by net earnings and continued DTA utilization. Our supplementary leverage ratio also improved to 6% with
about half of the sequential increase due to the impact of the revised final U.S. rules. And our tangible book value grew
to $57.73 per share.
In summary, our results in the third quarter demonstrated momentum across the firm. In Consumer Banking, we grew
revenues, loans and deposits in every region, resulting in positive operating leverage and strong income growth over
last year. And in our institutional franchise, we saw broad revenue growth across markets, Investment Banking and
Treasury and Trade Solutions, also resulting in positive operating leverage and significant growth in net income.
In Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter while continuing to wind-down the remaining assets in an
economically-rational manner. And we continued to grow our book and regulatory capital.
Looking to the fourth quarter, in Consumer Banking, we expect to continue growing our revenues while maintaining
positive operating leverage year-over-year. In markets, our results will likely reflect the overall environment as well as
normal seasonal treads. In Investment Banking, revenues should also reflect the overall market but we feel good about
the quality and momentum of our franchise as demonstrated by our performance. And in Treasury and Trade Solutions,
we believe we can continue growing our revenues year-over-year in the fourth quarter, driven by continued volume
growth and abating spread headwinds.
Turning to expenses, in Citicorp, our core operating expenses should be relatively flat to third quarter levels as we
expect to continue to face ongoing higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to our enhanced
capital planning process. Repositioning expenses should be more or less in line with the roughly $400 million we
incurred in the third quarter. And legal costs will likely remain elevated and episodic in nature. We continue to have an

overall favorable outlook with regard to our credit performance.
And finally, we expect our tax rate for the fourth quarter to be broadly in line with the first half of the year in the range
of 32%.
With that, Mike and I would be happy to take any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Jim.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey. I appreciate the sort of give up on – or just the disclosure on Mexico, obviously that's
been a focus of investors. Can you give us – obviously, you've probably done a very thorough review. Can you give us
a sense of how you feel about just overall risks, people talk about AMO issues or worries about that. As you've gone
through the process, can you give us some comfort level there.
And then I guess, maybe taking a step back, second question being as you reduce complexity by getting out of 11 more
markets, potentially getting rid of OneMain, how do you feel that helps you going into CCAR next year? Thanks.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Sure. Jim, I think from a Mexico perspective we said as part of OSA, we were going to
embark on a comprehensive review of our policies and processes. That review is significantly underway. I think we've
made some meaningful changes to the way we've come to work and think about things in Mexico. We continue to be
focused on those things and, again, are committed to getting the franchise to the right place. It's an important franchise
for us in every sense of the word and a place where we think there's growth and a place where we need to and should be
making investment and we've got to get those things right and we're committed to do that. And we've put a lot of
resources forward, both locally and from around the globe, to help us be able to do that as quickly as we can.
I think from a complexity perspective, I think two things. One is I think you hit on part of it, and John and I talked
about it. These 11 consumer markets plus the Korean piece were those that were in the optimized bucket. They were
those that we were working with the businesses on in terms of trying to create a pathway to proper returns. We didn't,
in the end, see that in these. And so I think, in many ways, these decisions were made around a couple axes. One is that
we didn't see the prospect to getting to adequate returns in a reasonable period of time. Second, we felt that we could
take those resources and we could reallocate them into other parts of our business where we would certainly have the
ability to try to get more out of them. And I think the third piece you touch on is around those if you don't have a
pathway to that, it doesn't make sense to keep complexity or keep things in the firm that aren't going be able to touch
those. So I think we were able to tick off several boxes by making these moves.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. No. Makes sense. And I think with these sales though, it seems like that helps
profitability. Does that give you more comfort on the ROA target? And just a quick clarification. Your ROA target of
90 basis points includes Citi Holdings and that contemplates have had some questions around the selling of OneMain
and what that may do to your targets?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: That's right. That's right. Yes. And so the ROA target includes Citi Holdings so that, that'll
be there to begin. We've put all the caveats around big gains or losses that are outsized, et cetera, but that's there. And
again I think you can see in these moves and again as we described, we're going to move these businesses into Citi
Holdings and in Citi Holdings, I think, we've proven we've got the expertise and the people that can manage these exits

well and we don't want our go forward businesses distracted in that process. And again, we've already started the
process against most of those and have an expectation that we'd like to be out of the majority of those by the end of
2015.

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Thanks. Following up on the targets. John and Mike, I was wondering how you're
feeling on the Consumer Bank on the GCB targets for efficiency ratio. On slide 12, John talked about the target and
you give the helpful box there. The 49% to 52% efficiency target seems like a stretch from the pro forma 55%. Could
you help us feel better about what some of the drivers are there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Sure, John. When you take a look at that slide, I think you'll notice that at the top of the
slide, there's a blue box that has the repositioning charges and legal charges of $800 million, and that both the 56% and
the 55% figures include what we would think of as being rather outsized repositioning and legal charges over the last –
on a trailing 12-month basis. So that – so I think you've got two things. One is, as you can see with the dark blue boxes,
both on this slide as well as the next slide, we are continuing to drive down the core operating expenses in the business.
But then at the same time then, I don't think that we'll see the same level of repositioning charges going into 2015 that
we've seen during 2014.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. That's helpful. And, John, did you mention that there'll be any repositioning
charges for the simplification that you described today? Or is that a driver of the 400 that you talked about for the
fourth quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The – I didn't – I'm sorry, John. I missed the beginning part of your question.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: I'm sorry [indiscernible] (00:34:23) I'm just wondering what repositioning expenses
might be associated with the strategic actions you announced today.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, nothing specific in that 400 related to the 11 markets. Those things...
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: A lot – whether or not we have repositioning charges associated with that will really be
determined based upon the structure of whatever deal that we negotiate on a sale. So it's a little...
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Early to call that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then just to clarify, the CCAR expenses you mentioned, incremental costs
of $100 million to $150 million in 2014 over 2013?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Correct.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And you spent $60 million so far...

<A - John C. Gerspach>: $150 million, John – $150 million to $175 million is the number that I quoted.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And that's – you spent $60 million or so this quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We spent an incremental $60 million year-over-year this quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And was there any in the first half of the year that would count to that $150 million to
$175 million?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, there were some – certainly beginning in the second quarter, I don't have that number
right in front of me, but it would have been much less than the $60 million that we had in the third quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So where you assuming...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And then we expect those expenses then to continue to ramp up into the fourth quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it. Okay. So we can kind of put the pieces together there. And then you said
one-third of it, you expect to be nonrecurring?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Correct.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Okay. And then just on credit, John, you had the reserve release in
International Consumer. What drove that? And how are you feeling about reserve releases continuing in the other parts
of the businesses, domestically, in Citicorp and then also in Holdings?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I'd say that we're still seeing – well, first, as far as from an international point of view,
that was largely driven by Asia, but also by continuing favorable credit trends throughout the countries, with the
exception of where I called out the NCL rate issue that we have in Mexico. Although again, the NCL – the dollar losses
there of net credit losses were largely in line with our expectations. It's much more of a rate issue. We continue to see
real favorable credit in North America, certainly in both our Mortgage business, but importantly in both of our Cards
businesses, Branded Cards as well as Retail Services. So that story is still continuing. When I look at the net credit
margin, which I think you see it in the supplement, the net credit margin in our Branded Cards business this quarter was
over 950 basis points. So that's really outstanding performance in that U.S. Branded Cards business.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: How should we think about whether we'll likely to see some reserve releases in Card
or in the Mortgage part of Holdings going forward?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, Mortgages – as far as from a Holdings point of view, John, you can pretty much
expect that we're going to be largely netting off reserve releases against the NCLs that come out of Mortgages. This
quarter it was just about 100%, I think it was like 101%. Last quarter, we were in the 90% range. So you're going to see
a large portion of the – of whatever losses we take in the Mortgage book in Holdings, offset by reserve releases.
As far as the rest of the world, I don't think you're going to see much more in the way of reserve releases coming out of
our International Consumer operations. We continue to grow those books. And so just as you continue to grow the loan
book you're going to have to build loan loss reserves against that. And then in the U.S., it's really going be driven by
just how much better our credit performance can get in our two Cards businesses. You might still see some reserve
releases in the near quarters, but I wouldn't look out much past that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All right.

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello, there. Maybe just a little color on timing and what drove the one time implementation
of the FCA on the over-the-counter derivs that you mentioned. I think you have the bullet on slide 3?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, this is something that we've been looking at for some time. There's been a couple of
other institutions that have adopted it, so it's something that's been knocking around in the market. We've set ourselves
a goal to adopt it sometime during 2014. As soon as we could get all the systems in place and we had the ability to
monitor this type of calculation over several months, a full quarter. And so we have gotten everything in place, and we
felt comfortable then pulling the trigger on the formal adoption in the third quarter instead of waiting until the fourth
quarter. We think it's the way the industry is going and, therefore, we wanted to adopt it as soon as we felt comfortable
that we had the systems in place to track it.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. And this is the one-time catch, I think like you said some people have adopted, some
haven't. And you expect everybody to by year end?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't know about by year-end but I do think that over time, and I don't know whether time
is by this year-end or next year-end, I think that the move is to go that way and we just felt it was better to be at least in
the middle of the pack.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got it. Okay. We can move on. Thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No problem.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: You've had the big benefit, as others have, as lower average rate on long-term debt. And that's
been a driver of your stable and actually even growing margin. So I heard your comments about the 1 or 2 basis points
not overly focused on that. But my one question is, is looking forward in terms of debt coming due and all thoughts
around TLAC, how much more optimization do you see coming in, say, the next two years on the cost of financing,
impact on the margin, and then where you fit in TLAC in general?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay. That's a very broad question. So let me try to...
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Sorry.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, that's okay. That's all right. It's a great question. But let me just try to break it down into
pieces. So let me start I guess with TLAC is probably because that was, again, we still don't know where TLAC is
going to come out. We've all seen the rumors and everything else, but we haven't seen the formal rules yet. So it's a
little hard to judge exactly what's going be implemented with TLAC. But from a TLAC point of view right now, we
would put our loss absorb and capital at just over 20% of our risk-weighted assets. Now, that's, again, our calculation
based upon our interpretation of the rules and in order to get to that 20%, for instance, we have eliminated all of the
structured notes that we issue, as saying that we think that there will be ultimately kept out of the rule. That may be
right, that may be wrong, but that's what gets us to that little bit over 20%. So we feel like we're okay with TLAC. But
obviously, there'll be more work to do and we'll have to see, again, how the rules come out.
So let's put the response to TLAC aside just for a second. And then when you take a look at our existing book, I still
think that there is some optimization work that we can do on the liability side of our balance sheet. Don't forget we still
have debt that we're carrying, that was issued in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 when our credit spreads were much higher
than they are today. And so as that debt runs off, that can still give you some lift.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Maybe the other side of the equation is, I've noticed, the growth in international markets has
been good on the loan side. The deposit growth has been less impressive. I don't know if that's something that you're
doing consciously or just a product of some of the markets that you're in. I'm just curious on...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. Glenn, what you're seeing is – we are active managers of our balance sheet. And again,
you'll notice that at least especially – if you take a look at the U.S. cards business. I've mentioned that before. You'll see
there that we've actually been driving up yields in the U.S. Card business as we've let those promotional balances run

off. We've actually experienced higher yield than on those interest earning assets. So I don't want you to think that
everything we're doing is just on the right hand of the balance sheet. We're actively moving on the left-hand side of the
balance sheet as well as we think about driving our NIM performance.
But to your other question then on deposits, yes, we're active managers of our deposit base as well. And we're looking
to run what we would term a compact balance sheet. We're not looking to grow the balance sheet much beyond where
it is today. We don't think we need a balance sheet much larger than $1.9 trillion to serve our clients. And so within that
construct then you need to be very careful about both what you put on the left side of the balance sheet and how you
fund that on the right side of the balance sheet. So when you deal with all the rules that are out there, as far as net stable
funding ratio, the LCR, the SLR, all of those rules come into play as we think about how to structure the right side of
the balance sheet.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Maybe just a really quick wrap up. We definitely appreciate slide 8 and the impact of
the strategic actions. Are we looking at that slide each quarter as we roll through 2015 or is there a chance you move
those 11 markets into something like discontinued ops and we get a clean look at Citicorp without it?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. Glenn, one of the things that we mentioned is that effective with the beginning – with
the first quarter, we'll move those 11 markets into Holdings. So that we will give you a clean...
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We'll give you a clean look at the GCB. We'll show it on pro forma basis again next quarter.
But then beginning in the first quarter, we'll give you a clean look at the Global Consumer Bank.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Thank you. Missed that one. Appreciate it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's not a problem, sir.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Hi. Good afternoon. How are you?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Brennan.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So first one, just a quick one. I don't know whether you can comment. JPMorgan gave us a
little color on the source of it – the legal charge, is it possible to say what that's tied to? I think JPMorgan indicated it
was heavily tied to FX.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, Brennan, as you know we typically don't comment on reserving actions unless it's
related to a specific settlement that we're announcing. So that's as far as we're going to go today.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then on the funding side, I believe you had said that funding costs drove the NIM
expansion. Maybe give a bit more color on, specifically, what was behind that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, again, as we manage both our deposit as well as – the cost of our deposits as well as
the cost of our debt, we've managed to improve the cost of funds. I'm – I don't know if that's giving you enough or if
you need something. But the improvement was just about evenly split between the two and so that's actively managing
deposits, we're managing down things like time deposits and instead concentrating on getting deposit growth in
operating balances, which are either interest free or interest light. And then on the long-term debt, again, we're
swapping out debt where we had issued it under higher credit spreads and replacing it with debt that is a bit more
attractive to us today.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Yeah, I know. I'm Sorry if I wasn't – I meant is there any geography impact there or
anything beyond just shifting away from time deposits?

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, from a geography point of view, again, most of the debt would be U.S. centric.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And the deposits would be a global phenomena.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then thinking about your rate shock scenario, can you give any color about what
that might look in year two or how you might think about that in year two? Just trying to think about the benefit from
rolling the portfolio into higher yielding securities versus your expectation for deposit pricing pressure?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, when we put out the $1.9 billion impact that really is – it's a rate shock type of thing.
And so it's an estimate as to what the revenue impact would be to the firm over a year if rates just moved
instantaneously by 100 basis points. Now, obviously, then as you begin to operate in that environment, there would be
a lot of moving pieces and give and take. But I would say that for the most part that, that $1.9 billion should be
sustaining into year two. I mean, you might have some changes, a little bit around the edges but it should be largely
sustaining.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. I guess with the – so effectively the benefit from rolling into higher rates would
probably be largely offset by increasing deposit pricing?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, if you're in a rising rate environment, again, it's going to certainly impact both sides
of your balance sheet. That's why I'd say it will be largely sustaining.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, terrific. And then last one with me, is it possible to get a rough idea of the cost basis
on OneMain?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: All right. Figured I'd give it a shot. Thanks a lot.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It was – that's okay, Brennan. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hi, gentlemen.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Guy.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Hi, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hey. So you announced what sounded like very logical moves on the Global Consumer side.
I was wondering if you could give us a sense for the capital free-up potential with – what's either your capital allocated
to those markets or the RWA impact?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, not at this point in time, Guy, all right? I mean, we're still – we've given you the
capital attribution for the overall Consumer business. And we'll refresh that in the first quarter. When we've refreshed
that in the first quarter, you'll see the impact from those exits as well as other changes.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, fair enough. When you think about what you've been doing to try to get a more
positive CCAR outcome next time, I was wondering if you have had some discussions with the regulators about how
they would view this type of strategic action that you're taking?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Sure. Guy, it's Mike. Obviously, we're in pretty constant and consistent dialogue with the
regulators. I think in there, the business model and the running of the business is our decision in terms of what we want

to do. And provided that we can show we've got the ability to run it in the right way, they're fine with that. I think to the
earlier question, in this case, that given these aren't and we don't see a path in the intermediate term to being accretive
to our shareholders, it will certainly work towards a smaller, simpler Consumer business, a more focused Consumer
business, and in the end taking those factors, you've got to view that as a positive. But the regulators haven't
commented specifically on it.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah. Got it. Just a question on the DTA utilization. The level you did in the quarter was
kind of comparable to what you did last year on a quarterly basis, but I think in the first half you had been running
more around $1.1 billion. I was just wondering, mechanically, maybe you can explain to us why it fell off?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. Really, it has to do, Guy, with everything – earnings has been fairly consistent. So if
you look at the earnings impact over the last couple of quarters, our earnings, both coming out of Citicorp as well as
Citi Holdings, have been running at about $800 million a quarter. I think one quarter it hit $900 million, so the real
change from what we were running in the first half to what we ran in the second really has to do with the impact of
CVA and OCI. And it's as simple as that. But the earnings potential, if you go into the back of the deck...
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Page 39.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Page 39, there you'll see that over – for a trailing 12-month period, the earnings of Corp and
Holdings utilized $3.4 billion of DTA.
Now on a year-to-date basis that similar number is $2.6 billion. And in the quarter, it was $800 million. So again, very
consistent at $800 million, $900 million a quarter as the earnings power of the franchise begins to utilize the DTA. It's
the other stuff, it's how the OCI moves that gives you a little bit of noise that you see over there on the right side. For a
full year, the impact of all of that was $200 million of utilization. But you're going to get noise quarter-to-quarter.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. So the noise is going to depend on what happens to your credit spreads and those of
your counterparties and OCI, in other words, rates. And so you're really not going to know about that until the end of
the quarter, basically?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's exactly right, Guy. But again, the – so the – and again, that's going be some noise.
But I think that the number that you really want to focus on is how are we doing as far as utilizing DTA, driven by the
earnings capacity of the franchise?
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, understood. Absolutely. JPM called out the emerging markets revenues in FICC as a
driver of the relative strength in the quarter, and I was kind of surprised that you didn't, that you indicated securitized
products more, just given your mix. Could you give us a sense for emerging markets results in FICC in the quarter
versus the two reference quarters?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, our emerging markets franchises performed very well in the quarter. They didn't
necessarily contribute as much to growth year-over-year because they actually had a pretty good performance in the
third quarter of last year. Now, the FX franchise performed well globally, driven by September. But if you're just trying
to isolate what changed year-over-year, securitized products had a slightly larger contribution. And if you think about
the environment that we were living in, in the third quarter of last year compared to the third quarter of this year, I think
it's pretty easy to figure out why there would have been a little bit more client activity around securitized products, it
was just a little bit better. Even though it wasn't a great rate environment, it was certainly a better rate environment than
– U.S. rate environment than what we had last year.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, it makes sense. Final one for me. During the quarter, at least some of the, I guess,
Dodd-Frank-driven new daily filings on liquidity, and I think some of the Volcker stuff, started to go into effect for the
G-SIBs. And I was just wondering to what extent you might ascribe some of what – what we were hearing towards the
end of the quarter was some liquidity issues in credit markets. Does that have anything to do with it?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't know if I would ascribe movements in the credit markets to – to certainly not to
Volcker. But I think everyone is looking to see how they're going to manage in a SLR, LCR, NSFR type of world. And
any time that you put out brand new rules, I think it takes a while then for the system to sort of adapt to them. And that

may have been some of the noise that you heard about at the end of the quarter.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: But do you think it has or maybe had temporarily an impact on the inventory management
for the big dealers?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I would say that anybody who's concerned about managing their balance sheet, yeah, it
would definitely have an impact. You have to be highly cognizant now of your SLR ratio, and you've got to manage
through both the SLR and the LCR. So depending upon what deposits you take in, those deposits could have a high
liquidity value or they could have zero liquidity value. If a deposit has zero liquidity value, then you can't do anything
with it other than invest it overnight, which means that you're holding either cash or overnight Treasury securities. Now
that drives up the asset side of your balance sheet, and now you've got to be worried about your SLR constraints,
because all of a sudden, now, you've got to put capital against that. So depending upon where any individual firm was
at quarter-end, I would say that they were definitely watching both the asset side of the balance sheet from an SLR
point of view, and the right side of the balance sheet from a combined LCR and SLR point of view.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: If I could follow up with your comment about a strong CCAR submission, if you
could just elaborate on that. What exactly does strong mean? Do you think from a process point of view, from a capital
deployment ask, or just any comments you can give around that, since you did mention it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I think as I described, Matt, I think that, really, we've been focused on a number of
things but one is that really taking the CCAR process and really embedding it into the firm. And again, I think that goes
along a few different channels. One is management engagement. How is management thinking about their business?
What are the risks in their business? How do we quantify those? How do we position the firm against those? Second is,
I think work where we've done around our models. Model building, model validation, model integration into the firm. I
think that we've worked hard in terms of making sure, in essence, we've got the boots on the ground across the different
areas, in particular, second and third lines of defense and making sure that they're synced up against our businesses and
really operating in the right way.
So it's a big focus towards model build out that infrastructure but most importantly, how really that gets embedded in
the way we think about and run the business on a day-to-day basis. Not a one-off submission and then back to the old
ways.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And I realize it's still I guess about five, six months away, in order to get all
the guidelines. But as you think about what a successful outcome would be, is passing on a qualitative basis enough or
would you want to also be able to have a meaningful, not of buy-backs as well, to view as a success?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I think that as you alerted to, we're not going to speak to what the number is. But
we've got to certainly get beyond success being measured as a successful submission with no capital ask, right? We're
in a position where we're fortunate to generate large amounts of regulatory capital and we've got to put the firm in a
position to return that. So I would view a successful ask as a combination of those things.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately on expenses, the 4Q commentary of relatively flat
on a core basis was helpful. As we think into next year, maybe before we account for some of the business exits, but
how should we think about the expense run rate beyond this year? You've been taken some of these repositioning costs
that I know have been driving a positive operating leverage. Is there more benefit from those still to come?

Citicorp in that – in the mid-50s efficiency ratio. And so that's the target that we've set out for ourselves a year and a

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. As far as the GCB restructuring, Mike, is this it? Going from 35 markets to 24 or is there
potentially more?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Well, I think as you look, Mike, just to kind of put it in context – I think we've gone from a
number higher than that. I think, in aggregate, we're down somewhere around 15, 17 markets in the past couple years.
And so what we've said is that we've got an ongoing process, which we've talked very openly out about our country
bucketing and business bucketing and the way we think about those. We do still have businesses in the optimized
bucket. Those businesses obviously not being on the list are making progress towards the goals that we've agreed to in
terms of where they're going to get those businesses. And again those buckets will continue as they've been to be fluid
and we'll keep assessing things against what we've laid out. But right now, those businesses are on track and feel like
they've got a pathway to get to a place of having adequate returns or good returns in the consumer business.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Is there more restructuring in the U.S. that you can do? You mentioned mortgage and branches.
What else could be done?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Well, as we laid out on page – we've laid out as a series of metrics from a head count, from
a product perspective, from a site perspective, things that probably the largest drivers of cost in there. It's page 13 in the
deck. And so we're committed on delivering those. We've made significant progress against those. Continuing to
simplify our products, continuing to rationalize our branch footprint, continuing to shrink and consolidate our support
sites. And again those are the big drivers of expenses. So I think as we've laid out there, we've got more work we think
we can do.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So getting to that target range in GCB of 49% to 52% that would be more than simply less legal
and repositioning costs? John, I think your answer earlier said that was going be a nice driver of it. But other than that,
what would be the main drivers?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, Mike, as I said before, there's two elements to it. I drew your attention – at least I
intended to draw the attention to that chart 12 and note that there were two areas of the expenses. We had the light blue
box at the top, which talked about the legal and repositioning charges and I pointed that as one area that would
contribute – we felt would contribute next year. But more importantly, and I think this is where you're driving, it's the
big blue box at the bottom that really talks about those core operating expenses. And there, we intend to continue to
drive those core operating expenses down.
We lay out for you on slide 12 the progress that we've made on a trailing 12-month basis. But then you can also see,
when you flip over to slide 13, that we're making progress in that area on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And that is going
to continue as we continue to execute on the actions that Mike talked about as we continue to reduce head count, we
continue to simplify the product offering, and we continue to rationalize our branch and support site structures. So all
of that work continues. It's ongoing now. It will remain ongoing into next year.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And beyond.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And last follow up and that's it. When you say support site, I'm just trying to get more meat on
the bones on this slide 13. Is support site going down? Is that a big expense takeout or the head count reduction, the
branches, that should all help. I'm just trying to get a sense of magnitude.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: So support sites, Mike, they break into probably two big buckets. One would be service
centers and the second would be data centers. And obviously, as you consolidate those, turn space back, create more
scale, et cetera, you've got the ability to get those costs out Centers of Excellence, however you choose to describe
them. And so I think we've shown the ability to do that and we've got more work to do.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, Mike, I think when you look at those four items that we lay out there, they all are
somewhat interrelated. We don't have standardized the platform there but clearly as you simplify your products and you
standard – and you put everything onto one standard platform, that means then that you can collapse a lot of individual
call centers into one because you're not running individual call centers for different products in every country, each one
then having to deal with a different operating system.
So we standardize the information available to our customer service personnel. We make it easier for them to
understand the products that we offer. That enables them to provide a much better experience to our clients. So we can
simplify the products, we standardize the platforms, we can reduce the sites and, therefore, we can actually provide our
clients with a better experience with less people.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. That's helpful. Just one other separate question. I opened up the paper this morning
saw some comments from Mike O'Neill, the chairman. And so Mike Corbat, what's your current relationship with Mike
O'Neill and just – I thought the timing was interesting to see the chairman – and Citigroup's the last major U.S. bank
that has the CEO and Chairman position split. So I'm wondering your current thoughts on that, the tradeoff, the
benefits, the costs of having that.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Sure. I think from our perspective, I won't speak to others, I think our relationship and our
structure works well for us. I think our relationship is excellent. I think the dialogue with the board is very good. And I
think from a governance perspective and a relationship perspective and when we think about run the firm and the
delineation of duties, it certainly works for us.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And the degree that Mike O'Neill's giving you counsel when it comes to these restructuring
moves like the one you announced today?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think we always have good, engaged strategic interaction with the board, not just Mike,
but with the board. And so the board was aware of these actions and supportive of the actions that management
recommended.

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Good morning. Just a quick ticky-tacky question at this stage. You mentioned the core
operating expenses at $10.9 billion looking to keep relatively flat into 4Q. I know we have CCAR expenses coming up
a little bit. I mean, maybe that adds a percent or something like that. But we should expect those CCAR expenses are
on top of what you did in 3Q would be incremental? Or are you saying that you think you have other things in core
operating expenses you're going to peel back and that's going to offset CCAR expense increase in the quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, we would say that the – again, we should be able to keep the expenses relatively flat
into the fourth quarter. We still have benefits that are rolling off or other expense initiatives that we've introduced. I
mean you've seen the amount of repositioning charges that we've taken. Those repositioning charges do generate real

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Hi. Can you share with us – in your last Q I think you put in there that 100 basis point
parallel shift in the yield curve would contribute an additional $1.9 billion or so to revenue. If the yield curve flattens
and the Fed does move rates up next year, but as you notice today, the 10 year is down to about 2.2%. If we don't get
the parallel shift, how much of the benefit would you likely see with the front end going up but long end remaining
anchored where it is today?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes. See, if the front end went up but the long end dropped – there is scenario that we've
laid out for you which has 100 basis point increase in short term and relatively flat, long-term. I think what you see in
that type of environment, we capture the lion's share of the $1.9 billion. I don't have that number in my head. But it's
virtually – it's a substantial portion of the $1.9 billion.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Great. The second question is, can you remind us, in terms of your capital ratios, your Tier
1 common ratio, for example, what kind of cushion do you want to keep above whatever the final number turns out to
be? And I know that's a moving target, because you're seeing the Fed and others ask for more capital and they haven't
given us the exact numbers yet. But are you looking to maintain a 50 or 100 basis point number over whatever the final
target becomes?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, as you say, it's a little hard right now because we don't know where the final rules are
going to come out. So let's – give us a chance to take a look at the final rule and then we'll be happy to tell you what
kind of buffer we think we need. I mean there's still a bit of rule making yet to be laid down. We've got the promise of
another G-SIFI surcharge. We've got OLA that still needs to be finalized. So when these things begin to settle down,
we'll be happy to come back to you then with a more informed target.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. Thank you. And the as of today, what would you point to as your binding constraint
on the capital ratios? Which one do you guys look to today? And again I know this may not be the case a year from
now.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, let's see. On October 14, I'd say it's Tier 1 Basel III advanced approach Tier 1
common.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: But check back with me by November 14 and I may have a slightly different answer. And
I'm not trying to be cute, it's just that as the rules begin to change and they intersect, you're constantly battling one
against the other. If you would ask me a year ago, I would have said, SLR was going be the binding constraint. Six
months ago, I was really worried that standardized RWA – the standardized approach was going to be the binding
constraint. Today, I feel like it's Basel III Tier 1 common. And then, of course, there's always what the ultimate is, is of
course is the CCAR submission itself. So we need to keep our eye on all four of those and it's – it doesn't do you any
good to just manage one.

<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Great. And then one last question. The shared national credit exam hasn't been released yet.
Probably will be shortly here. But there was some commentary by the Federal Reserve, they're still concerned about
leverage loans by some of the larger banks that they're aggressively underwriting them and they now claim they may
use this in CCAR as part of the qualitative area. Do you guys have any color on that? Or what do you think about that?
Are you concerned about that, if they bring it into the CCAR process the way everybody underwrites leveraged
lending?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Those rumors are there, Gerard. We haven't heard anything on that, formally. So obviously
this has been a big area of focus for the Fed and the OCC. And so, evolving but we haven't gotten any guidance on that
so far.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Hey, Steven.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: I was hoping you could provide some clarity on what drove the sequential increase in
risk-weighted assets. Historically, what we've seen, particularly given periods of elevated FX volatility, that there's a
natural capital hedge from FX translation on the RWA denominator. I didn't know if you could provide some more
detailed guidance as to, what were the sources of RWA build in the quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, that's a good question, Steven. Since the beginning of the year, we've absorbed about
– well, you can see it in the chart back on slide 20. We've got about $60 billion in incremental RWA since the
beginning of the year. The impact of business growth in Citicorp has been more than offset by reductions in Holdings,
and we've gotten a little bit of FX benefit in this quarter, that was probably worth about $10 billion or so. But the entire
net impact really is the result of enhancements to our risk models, primarily credit models, and as well as our
interpretation of the final B-III rules. So we've been enhancing our models and that's caused us then to increase the
amount of risk-weighted assets that are required.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thanks. That's really helpful. I mean, is that model enhancement process, is it largely
completed at this juncture? Or do you – should we expect that there's more to come, which could result in some RWA
stickiness going forward?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I'd say that we think that, now, we've done an intensive review of the models,
certainly, especially in the period since we've gone live on the Basel III advanced approach. And we're certainly
comfortable with the models as they exist right now. But here comes the big however. However, our regulators still
continue their reviews, so there still may be additional enhancements required going forward.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right. Fair enough. And just one more for me. Relating to the Securities portfolio and,
specifically, the breakdown of HTM versus AFS. The last two quarters, we've seen an increase in the amount of
securities that you've classified as held to maturity. And just looking at last year's CCAR results, and in addition to that,
your mid-year stress test exam, which were published for public consumption, the AOCI losses were actually quite
substantial, and presumably should only increase as the number of Basel III deductions are recognized within the
transitional horizon. And I was wondering whether CCAR considerations have actually prompted you to accelerate the
reclassification of some of your Securities portfolio, and is that something that we should expect to persist going
forward?

<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, I'd say if you looked at the percentage of our investment portfolio that is classified as
HTM, we're probably underweight compared to many of our peers. And so, as we look at the possibility of
reclassifying things between AFS and HTM, it's a little bit more being driven by our view as far as volatility in our
OCI, and therefore, how that impacts the numerator in our regulatory capital.
So again, that's really our focus. We want to make sure we've got the right mix. And again, we don't want to overweight
towards hold to maturity. But we would look at it right now and say, perhaps, we're a little underweight where we are.
Having said that, we're very comfortable with the level that we have right now, so I'm not leading you to the fact that
we're going to be increasing it dramatically, but we may continue to add bits and pieces into the HTM.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right. Understood. Thanks for clarifying that, John, and thank you for taking my

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Thanks, guys. Just this one question for me. John, you alluded in your prepared remarks to
the recent bit of slowing in some of the international businesses. And I just wondered if you could just flush out for us,
when you think about your international businesses and developed versus emerging markets, do you see that slowdown
as either, A, partly seasonal; B, any change in terms of how you're perceiving growth or; C, related to just this kind of
global downgrade of growth expectations and how are you responding to that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. I would say it's more of the latter as far as just the overall impact of everyone's
expectations for global growth being – coming down a bit. In the comments that I made earlier, I think what you're
referring to is some of the comments I made as far as loan growth that we had in Latin America, specifically Mexico.
So you do have certain market-by-market where you can see the impact. But from an emerging market view, we still
see good growth, good overall growth coming out of the emerging markets especially when compared to the developed
markets. It's just a little bit less growth than what we would have anticipated earlier in the year.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: And just as a quick follow up on that, have you noticed anything then – you'd mentioned a
couple of comments in your prepared comments in the deck about spreads but has the spread and competitive
environment changed at all in that tune? Are you finding yourself still able to gain share within those faster growing
economies?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, we're doing fine. I mean, and I think that we're managing to keep pace within the
economies in which we operate. I mean we have seen spread pressure hit us in the trade product. That's certainly
something that hit us this quarter. When you take a look at the revenue growth in TTS, the revenue growth in TTS was
impacted both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter by roughly a $40 million decline in trade product revenues.
And while the spreads in the cash management business were largely stable, overall trade spreads have been declining
now for several quarters. So we've seen that impact and – but we are maintaining our market share in that product, but

we're doing that by shifting to an originate-for-sale type of approach. So we're maintaining market share. But instead of
originating for balance sheet, we're originating to sell. That means that we forego net interest revenue in return for an
upfront fee. But as a result, the trade revenue assets have declined, some of our trade assets, but we've preserved and in
some cases have improved our returns. So there's different ways of managing through lower spread environments.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your
question.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Hi, John. Thanks for taking my question. Just first of all, and I don't want to make too much
of the midyear DFAST numbers. But I was curious, your PPNR estimate for the most recent mid-year DFAST was
down about a little less than 30%. In fact, that was in line with most of the other big banks. But I guess I'm just curious
if there's color you can provide as to what the difference was between the numbers that you put together for this year's
midyear cycle and last year's midyear cycle, just in terms of the PPNR change.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I think there's two things. One is, it's a different scenario. Obviously, each year, you
construct a different scenario in which you then assess your stress within that scenario. So there's the scenario
difference. And also, as Mike said earlier, we're in the process of enhancing our overall capital planning process and I
think you see some of the results in those numbers.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And just moving on to the mortgage business, I know that's not a huge contributor to
your overall bottom line. But I guess in the bigger picture, I'm just curious how you all are thinking about the potential
for loosening of standards by the FHFA, even if it's minimal loosening, in terms of opening up maybe the lower end of
the mortgage market and how much that might affect your ability to generate mortgage revenue given that you tend to
target slightly better credit quality customers?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Matt, I think – I guess I would start in that, Matt, in terms of saying I think that, that would
– that's important. I think it's good for the market. Because I think what we've seen is the mortgage market today isn't
functioning the way we'd like. If you're not 20% down and high FICO, it's been quite tough for people to get in and to
be able to afford and buy homes. So one is, I think, for the overall system, we would be supportive of that. I think as
you rightly point out, our model is largely focused around our Citi clients, which tend to be higher in FICOs and
probably have the ability to make higher down payments and higher deposits. But again, some of it falls in there and
we'd certainly be open and we'd be supportive of that. So I think from our perspective, I don't think it would have a big
impact on Citi, but I think it would be very constructive for the market.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.

<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Hi. I was wondering in the context of the page 8 disclosure about the impact of the
strategic actions is $7 billion in loans, roughly. And on page 31, we see that Korea alone has about $24 billion in
consumer loans. So I'm wondering what specifically is in there and what isn't? And in particular I guess I was
wondering is, from all those countries, is Citi Cards also withdrawing or is it just the basic branch system?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, let me try to help you through that one. First is, we are not exiting the consumer
franchise in Korea. We're exiting a specific element of the consumer – of that consumer business, the consumer finance
business in Korea, which is a much smaller component of the overall Korea franchise. So when you take a look at the
$24 billion worth of loans – the consumer loans that we have in Korea, it's a relatively small amount of those loans that
is actually then coming out. Okay?
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then just the card – in those 11 countries, are you basically, mainly, out of the
branch system or a branch banking business or also out of the card business as well?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's going to be out of cards as well as out of the branches.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then lastly for me, I'm not sure if you can comment, but on the cover of the

<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yeah, that seemed very small and I was wondering if there's anything you can – any color
you can provide us on how we should expect the disposition to proceed in the year ahead?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Sure. I would describe that as a filing and, again, I think our stated intent all along in this is
to go towards the process that drives this business in terms of best price, best terms to the right buyer. I would say that
kind of going in this, we'll run a sale process, and if we don't get a sale process to the right place then we'll pursue an
IPO, but we wanted to have the flexibility to do that, and if we got there, didn't want to have to wait the time
necessarily to do all the filing. And obviously, in preparation for the sale process, you do a lot of those things that are
requisite in the filing anyway. So it was, I think, convenient to be able to do that. So again, move towards the sale
process and we'll always have the option of an IPO if we want to use it.

<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Quick question on the strategic actions today. You mentioned that these are coming
mostly from the optimized restructure market that you had identified previously. But also on that same chart you also
identified 20 markets, which were the invest to grow markets. Now, assuming that you take these dollars, allocate it to
the 11 markets and move those to invest to grow. Kind of what are the top three markets that you're looking to invest in
these days?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I would say as we look around, we're clearly, in no particular order, investing in the U.S. in
several different ways. Continue to invest. We had a stated investment program that we're gearing towards Mexico.
We've talked about other markets in Asia where we've been targeted and continuing to grow our businesses. So I think
there's several places. I don't think there's a shortage of places where we can put these resources, so to speak, at better
levels than they're being used today.

<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Great. And just one other question on the tax rate guidance that you gave. Are you
assuming that all of the legal charges going forward are now going be tax deductible? And that's why you're getting to
the lower tax rate there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. No. No. We anticipate that – again, it's going be dependent upon item-by-item as far as
whether or not we would assess an accrual to be tax deductible or not. But as we look into the fourth quarter, right now,
we think that at 32% more or less tax rate is where we'll end up.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay. Not a problem.
