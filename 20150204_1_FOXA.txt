Reed Nolte
Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference
call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Co-Chief Operating
Officer; John Nallen, Our Chief Financial Officer.
First, we'll give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and I'll be happy to take questions from the
investment community.
This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to 21st Century Fox's business and strategy.
Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company's Form 10-Q for the three months ended

Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurement. The definition of, and a reconciliation of
such measures, can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial
measures used in this call such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as
EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP
reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to John.
John P. Nallen
All right. Thanks, Reed. As you'll have seen in today's earnings release, we reported another good quarter of financial
results led by double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth at our cable networks. Note that due to the sale in November
of our DBS businesses to Sky, our reported financial results include the consolidation of these businesses this year for
our partial quarter of ownership as compared to a full quarter consolidation a year-ago.
So to provide a more meaningful comparative analysis, we're providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted
EBITDA that excludes the DBS businesses in all periods. Most of the comments that follow will be on this adjusted
basis and our press release provides reconciliations between the reported results and this adjusted basis.
So, second quarter adjusted total company revenues were $7.4 billion, up 10% compared to the second quarter a
year-ago, reflecting double-digit increases in our cable network and film segments.
Adjusted total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.7 billion, up 12% over the $1.51 billion from a
year-ago. This increase reflects strong results of the cable network segment, improvements led by costs at the television
segment, and similar film contributions to a year-ago. Note that unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced our
overall total EBITDA growth rate in the quarter by six percentage points.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $6.2
billion, as compared to the $982 million, we reported in the second quarter a year-ago. This year's results include $5
billion of gains reported in other, net, which was principally from the company's sale of the DBS businesses to Sky.
Also included in this year's equity earnings of affiliate results is net after-tax income of approximately $100 million
related to Sky's gains on the sales of certain of its investments, partially offset by their purchase price amortization and
expenses related to their acquisition of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland.
Excluding net income effect of these net equity gains and last year's gain from participating in Sky's share repurchase
program, as well as the amounts reflected in other, net, second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.53 this year
versus $0.33 in the prior-year. This quarter's adjusted earnings per share, includes the recognition of various tax
benefits of approximately $250 million, or $0.12 per share.
For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our tax rate to approximate 31%. Also note that the net income and EPS
contributions of the DBS segment in each year were not significant.
Now let me provide some additional context on the performance of a few of our businesses, and let's start with the
cable network segment, where overall total segment revenues increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 16%
increase in affiliate revenues and 8% advertising revenue growth.
With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 19%, primarily from higher average rates led by the
RSNs, FX and Fox News as well as increases from the conversion of our new channels, FS1 and FXX. The inclusion of
the YES Network, this year also contributed to our growth and excluding the contribution from YES, we had a low
double-digit domestic affiliate fee increase. Our reported international affiliate fees were up 7%, reflecting strong
underlying local currency growth of about 20%.

The second quarter Cable segment advertising revenue growth of 8% reflects domestic advertising increases of 11%,
led by the FX Networks, FS1 and FXX. Reported international advertising grew 5%, but we had 10% growth on a local
currency basis, driven by strong year-over-year increases at STAR.
Total Cable segment EBITDA in the second quarter of $1.16 billion, was up 12% over the prior-year, reflecting the
strong revenue growth, which was partially offset by a planned 16% increase in expenses, primarily related to higher
sports rights and entertainment programming costs. The negative impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted
the segment growth rate by 6%.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 13% from higher contributions at our established networks as well as the
impact of consolidating the YES Network this year. EBITDA at Fox Sports 1 was below last year, reflecting the
planned increased programming costs associated with the inaugural broadcast of the Major League Baseball playoffs.
Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased 8% as strong double-digit local currency growth at
both FIC and the STAR entertainment channels was partially offset by the continued investment we're making in STAR
Sports and the negative impact from foreign exchange rates.
At our television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $290 million, an increase of $72 million as compared to the
prior-year result. This higher contribution is primarily due to lower programming costs, reflecting the absence of
X-Factor this year, the movement of Glee into the March quarter, and the shift of the Baseball League Championship
Series to Fox Sports 1.
Total segment revenues were consistent with a year-ago quarter, as strong retransmission consent revenue growth was
offset by a 3% decline in advertising revenues. This ad revenue decline is primarily due to lower general entertainment
ratings at the broadcast network and stations, offset in part by higher local political ad revenues related to the mid-term
elections.
Turning to our film segment, we reported second quarter EBITDA of $336 million, a similar result to that of a
year-ago, as higher film studio contributions were offset by fewer television series deliveries. Total segment revenues
in the quarter increased $276 million, or 11%, driven by several successful theatrical releases, including Gone Girl and
The Maze Runner. The majority of these higher theatrical revenues were offset by increased releasing costs for both
these films, as well as Exodus and Night at the Museum 3.
Now before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of capital-related comments. We ended the quarter with $10.1
billion in cash and $19.1 billion in gross debt, and the cash position reflects the net proceeds from the sale of Sky Italia
and Sky Deutschland during the quarter.
With regard to the stock buyback, we've repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of Fox A shares from July 1 through
today, and we're on plan to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12 month timeframe, we previously announced.
And today, the company increased its dividend and declared a semiannual dividend of $0.15 per share. This translates
to a $0.30 dividend on an annual basis, the 20% increase over the previous dividend payout.
Now let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015. As a reminder, for guidance purposes, we are excluding the
DBS businesses for the entirety of all periods, resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion.
On last quarter's earnings call, we mentioned that we had seen some puts and takes as against our original expectations
for fiscal 2015 with the negative variances at that time, primarily relating to the strengthening dollar and
underperformance at the broadcast network, as against our original expectations. Since that update, these trends have
continued, and at levels above what we expected.
Over the last three months, the U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly, further reducing the translated U.S. dollar
earnings from our international businesses, most notably from the Fox International Channels. Assuming exchange
rates stay where they are today, the strengthened dollar has now further reduced our fiscal 2015 EBITDA expectations
by an additional $100 million plus, resulting in a total full-year effect across the company of around $250 million

versus last year.
At our television broadcast business, the network and the stations, we now know that market and rating challenges were
more significant than we expected.
On the entertainment side, Empire and American Idol are doing well competitively, but our ratings overall have
underperformed and our expectation that the national and local ad markets would gain momentum going into calendar
2015 has not occurred. On the sports side, our biggest college football games in the quarter were all lopsided wins, with
an average score of 52-10, thereby impacting the viewership.
At our film segment, we continue to anticipate that the full-year contributions will exceed our original expectations, but
now, by a lesser amount than we thought three months ago, primarily reflecting lower-than-anticipated box office
results from our holiday releases, as well as closing on the transfer of our Shine business to the Endemol joint venture
earlier than we expected. This will result in the elimination of Shine's EBITDA contributions for the rest of the year, as
it moves to our equity affiliate line.
Despite our change in expectations around currencies, broadcast TV, and our film segment, our domestic cable network
businesses continued to perform right in line with our expectations.
So, considering these factors and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our current projections, we now expect
that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 will be toward the lower end of the
mid-single-digit range, above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level for fiscal 2014.
With that, let me turn it over to Chase.
Charles G. Carey
Thanks, John. Let me begin by expanding on John's comments on fiscal 2015 guidance. Reality is that the majority of
our businesses and key initiatives are on track and our competitive position is as strong as it's ever been in almost every
area. However, two issues, foreign currency and broadcast advertising shortfalls, simply became too large to offset. Let
me address these issues first and talk about the larger picture.
There isn't a lot to add to what John said about the currency issues. We're practical, we're addressing hedging strategies
to help manage the risk, but hedging will only mitigate further fluctuations, not the currency impact to-date.
On the broadcast side, network and stations, the issue is primarily entertainment rating shortfalls at our network
exacerbated by adverse industry trends, linear network ratings and the television advertising markets, which combined
leave our expected ad revenues well short of plan.
Looking forward to 2016...
John P. Nallen
Hang on, Chase. They can't hear you for some reason. Do you want to hit that again with that? Re-engage on that.
Charles G. Carey
Can you hear me?

Charles G. Carey
Can you hear us?
Operator
Yes, you're coming through loud and clear.
Charles G. Carey
Okay. All right. Good. Thanks. You want me to start again? Okay. I'll start again, because I don't know whether any of
that came on.
Let me begin by expanding on John's comments on fiscal 2015 guidance. Reality is that the majority of our businesses
and key initiatives are on track and our competitive position is as strong as ever in almost every area. However, two
issues, foreign currency and broadcast advertising shortfalls, simply became too large to offset. Let me address these
issues first and talk about the larger picture.
There isn't a lot to add to what John said about the currency issues. We're practical, we are addressing hedging
strategies to help manage the risk, but hedging will only mitigate further fluctuations, not the currency impact to-date.
On the broadcast side, network and stations, the issue is primarily entertainment rating shortfalls at our network
exacerbated by adverse industry trends, linear network ratings and the television advertising markets, which combined
leave our expected ad revenues well short of plan.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect these same themes to continue. The majority of our businesses are strong and on
track; however, currency moves this year will adversely impact 2016 profits by about $200 million, which is on top of
the approximately $250 million hit to expected 2016 profits from currency shifts last year, a total hit of about $450
million to our original 2016 projection in August 2013.
We also expect the next 12 months to be a period of investment in new programming at our broadcast network. In
addition, we anticipate the industry trends impacting advertising will be slightly larger than previously expected, as
both advertising and viewership continues to migrate to digital platforms.
Our original target for 2016 profits was $9 billion, which adjusted for the deconsolidation of the Skys and Shine would
be about $8 billion. Clearly, our broadcast business is not where we expected it to be at this time and external market
forces like currency have been more unfavorable than expected. While we still expect solid double-digit growth overall
next year due to the strength of most of our businesses, the challenges in currency and broadcasting now lead us to an
expected 2016 profit in the mid-$7 billion range.
We're obviously disappointed to fall short of our targets for this year and next. We take these targets seriously.
However, our overall goal is not to hit a short-term profit target, but to build shareholder value, which will be
determined by the overall momentum and competitive strengths of our businesses and how well they're positioned to
grow and succeed in light of broader economic, technological and global trends.
If our goal was to hit a short-term profit target, we'd pursue efforts like cutting marketing and programming costs at the
expense of future profits. We'll not do that, because we believe shareholder value is built through long-term growth.
In terms of that overall goal, we could not be more excited about the future. First, as noted earlier, most of our
businesses and key initiatives are on target and competitively as strong as ever. Affiliate revenues and retransmission
fees, which are the foundation for future growth, are on or ahead of our plans.
Among key initiatives, we've begun to once again reset the Fox News rate, reflect its importance in the market with
new agreements now in place with four MVPDs represent over a quarter of the market and Fox Sports 1 now has

affiliation agreements in place with all major MVPDs reflect the new FS1 rate.
Our domestic and international cable channels grew to represent about 70% of our profit. We're on track on a local
currency basis as of the new channel initiatives launched in the last few years. Our news, sports, and entertainment
channels continue to build in their leadership positions with truly unique and focused brands around the world. For
example, FX is really left competing basic cable networks behind with programming that makes it appear the premium
networks, while FXX has added an exciting new dimension to that group is the fastest-growing network in cable.
Our film and television businesses have great momentum and continue to distinguish themselves as industry leaders.
Our film business finished calendar 2014 with record-breaking worldwide box office. We've locked up key sports
content around the world through the rest of this decade to assure its access to this critical content and provide cost
stability.
Even in the earlier noted areas, where we faced challenges, we're excited about the future. And our broadcast business,
our issues have been ones of execution, not structure. The foundation is in place with retransmission revenues ahead of
plan with significant room to grow and our major sports rights are in place under long-term contracts.
Our challenge has been the networks' entertainment programming. After a few tough years, we believe we've turned the
corner with a new network management team, who inherited our current broadcast issues that has brought fresh
momentum and energy to the business. This is always a tough business to predict, but we are excited about new hits
like Empire and Gotham as well as the dynamic slate of new event programming. Our competitors have already shown
what difference a couple of hits can make.
It will take us time to get the broadcast business to where it should be in terms of profitability. The next year plus will
be a period of investment with a priority focused on building hit shows, not maximizing profits. The profits will follow.
We still believe our broadcast business has a strategic and financial future that is as promising as ever. The time when
the value of hit programming continues to grow exponentially, our broadcast network plays a unique role in launching
defining events like Empire.
Turning to the broader industry issues, the digital transition continues to be a glass half-full story for us. The movement
of advertising dollars and shift to consumer viewing is clearly going to continue. I think it is fair to say that this trend
recently has been a bit faster than many expected. These issues will put short-term pressure on our business, but
represent longer-term exciting growth opportunities as we're able to deliver more efficient and effective capabilities to
advertisers, better monetize viewership on digital platforms, and create new offers for consumers on these platforms.
Our content and brands are the ones consumers and advertisers want access to, first and foremost, and we're committed
to building the capabilities to meet that demand. Recent initiatives like the restructuring of ad sales organization and the
acquisition of TrueX are focused on that goal.
In closing, let me touch a return of capital on our balance sheet. We're well aware that the recent completion of the Sky
transaction, once again has our balance sheet in an overly liquid position. We will complete our $6 billion buyback as
planned, although that will still leave us with excess liquidity. Between now and fiscal year-end, our board will
continue to consider next steps.
Our priorities for capital remain the same: invest in our core businesses to grow long-term value; opportunistic
flexibility; and return of capital to shareholders. We continue to pursue our goal of achieving an efficient balance sheet,
but we'll do so in a deliberate manner.
Quite simply, our goal continues to be building shareholder value by growing our businesses, while returning capital to
shareholders, and we believe we're on track to achieve that goal. Thank you.
I'll turn it back to Reed.

Thank you, Chase. And now, Chase, James and John would be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. [Operator
Instructions] We will go to the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you. I guess, my question deals with investment in the business. And
maybe, James, you could talk about STAR, in India, in particular, and help us think about the profit potential of that
business. I think a while ago you guys had laid out a plan for EBITDA growth there, but the currencies have moved
against you. Help us think about the opportunity there, particularly in light of some of the non-rupee denominated costs
you have on the sport side?
And a similar question, maybe, Chase, on Fox Network. It sounds like your plan is to sort of double down. I don't know
if that's the right phrase, but invest more in primetime entertainment and push the programming. Can you give us some
color on that and how big you want to go and what we should be thinking about in terms of programming costs growth
at Fox over the next couple years? Thanks.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Sure. James, do you want to answer the first one?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Ben. I think the last time when we talked about the profit to the pathway for
the Indian business, actually since then, the currency has been reasonably stable over the last sort of seven months, or I
guess nine months now, so I don't think that's had an additional impact going forward from what we saw then.
But essentially, the STAR entertainment business, the local language business and the regional language business there
is a very profitable business today, a very attractive business. And really, we're reinvesting a lot of those profits to build
the sports business alongside that, which we think can really have a transformational effect on the business, since the
acquisition of the half-interest of ESPN STAR Sports that we didn't own previously.
And I think what we're seeing now is really the peak here of investments, in fact these coming quarters, with the
Cricket World Cup and a series of events really making that a heavy investment right now. But, we see that turning
reasonably quickly and we have pretty good certainty on what those rights costs look like for the STAR Sports
business.
We're launching two new sports channels, two HD channels, actually just in the next month to continue to grow the
portfolio, and we think over a five-year basis, this business at STAR India is a very, very profitable business. We think
it can get to north of – I've said in the past, I think, north of $500 million of profit and do it with some pace and some
velocity.
And I think investing in programming and investing on screen for our customers is a theme that you'll see everywhere
around the business. We really think that's the business that we're in and something that is super important for us and is
going to deliver a lot of long-term growth domestically here, as well as around the world.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think, I'd say on the Fox, on the network side, on broadcasting, I mean, it's certainly not
doubling down. In many ways what I'm trying to communicate is, what's our priority? And I think our priority is really
building hits, first and foremost. And, I guess, that's why I made the comment, if we wanted to just improve profits,
we'd squeeze programming and squeeze marketing, and we don't think that's the right move.
So, in many ways, I think it is making sure, we've got a bench of programming as we try and develop these hits. I think
this year we felt, we were a little thin in terms of having programming available. I think we always know not every
show's going to work and we've got to make sure we have appropriate flexibility to build. But, I think, what we're really
talking about is stabilizing the broadcast business and providing a platform to grow, but I think that real growth comes
in the next couple of years, not the next 12 months.

So, I think the next year will be a period more stabilizing that business and putting it on a path to growth. But, I think,
I'm talking more priorities, and I think to the degree it's spending; in reality, some of our more expensive programming,
is something like Glee, is ending its run, so obviously there are some costs that will go away, will not recur as we invest
in new shows.
But, I think, if you say, what's the investment, it's probably having a bit more flexibility and a bit more of a bench of
programming to launch next year, to enable us to have a few more shots at creating the hits that are the foundation for
the future.
Obviously, Empire and Gotham give us some exciting building blocks to grow off of, but it's not a significant increase
in costs. Again, I'm probably speaking more to what we think is the priority for the coming year.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Ben. Next question, please, operator?
Operator
Will come from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. Let me ask Chase and James. First, I wanted to know philosophically, what's
your view of participating in a product like the DISH Sling offer, which may not carry all of your channels, especially
RSNs.
And then on the Fox side, given that Gary and Dana are there now, how does the Fox studio plan in that need to maybe
have more bench strength? Do you see a shift to more and more cell phone hours at the network?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I'll start with the first. Look, I think these digital platforms are obviously a very
important part of our future. We're spending a lot of time sort of trying to engage with third parties, doing our own
analysis of what makes sense for us in terms of developing them.
I'm not going to comment on any one particular offer. And we certainly don't have announcements today. We are
working on a lot of things. I think we'll announce something when essentially we're ready to do it. I expect this to be an
area where we are busy and do move forward, but we're not going to rush to sort of make press releases.
I think what's most important, and I'm not sure I've seen it to-date, is there offers that resonate with the consumer. I
think a lot of what's been out there so far seems to be – whether it's driven by transactions or deals or something or
other considerations, I think we want to see can we bring things that are additive to our business. And I think at the
start, we have to make sure what we do in this space, as we do in other places, is additive to our business, but brings
new opportunities and interesting experiences to consumers, and whether that's through a richer experience, a better
interface, more choice.
Again, I think what we offer consumers today in many ways is a pretty attractive proposition. But, clearly there are
segments we're not reaching in the right way. And there are opportunities for us to expand and grow that pie. And we
are going to be active there, but we're going to be thoughtful about it as well and make sure it's done in a way that is
additive to our business as a whole as we go forward.
And on...
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: CCF TV.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: ...CCF TV, it's an important part. One of the core strategic reasons for putting them together
is increasingly – I think it's – we're not alone in this, a lot of the upside of what a network represents in terms of
launching programming is realized on the products, on the content side of it.

So, the real win-win for us is to launch content that we own. Doesn't mean we're not going to have third-party content
on our network. We will, because realistically, we want to have the best content possible. And it doesn't mean, we're
not going to sell content to third-party networks. We will do that as well.
But clearly, the sweet spot is using our network to be able to create assets that we own. And I think by putting them
together under one roof, we certainly create – it makes those opportunities more available to us. And certainly, I think,
streamlines that decision-making, make the ability to identify needs and ensure we're doing everything possible to
maximize the opportunities to launch a hit show is done by having that studio, the studio and the network work
together. But, it is one of the core benefits that we look to in putting the studio and the network under Gary and Dana's
leadership.

Thank you. From the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. Chase and James, we've all had a lot of focus on the path to fiscal 2016,
given the set-up from the Analyst Day. I'm wondering, by fiscal 2016, how much of the growth cycle is complete for
Fox? You already talked about broadcast and STARS, so maybe just thinking about – you mentioned Fox Sports 1 and
Fox Sports 2 has all the deals done. There's always concerns with the RSNs not being part of skinny packages, whether
traditional or online. And where are we as you look forward beyond fiscal 2016? How much of the growth has been
captured? How much is left? And then just quickly for John, if you could break down the local currency international
affiliate fee revenue growth of 20% for us. What were the drivers? That'd be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think we honestly believe our best growth is ahead of us. And that obviously, certainly
applies to some of the newer initiatives like FS1 or sports internationally. But I'd cited, I think upfront, talked about
Fox News, which I think just gets stronger, and we are once again resetting that business. Fox Business, I think we're
just really moving to really full competitive distribution. So, when I look at our portfolio of channels, both the
established ones and the newer ones, I think there's a lot of growth in the international marketplace.
Clearly, as you look at it around the world is certainly somewhere midstream in terms of reaching its full potential, it
varies by region, but there's an enormous amount of growth. We talked before about India, where that is, in terms of
what we think that business can be, as we move through this decade.
And look, ultimately, I really mean what I said when I talked about the digital platforms, and us taking advantage of
those, both directly and through other parties. I think for those who have – we really believe must-have content is going
to be a sweet spot in a digital world, it's the content people are going to want to watch. We refer to the RSNs. The
reality ends up being sports come at a cost, but they're also the product that's most in demand.
And I think, hit product is just going to grow exponentially in value and importance. And I think those that have the
heavy breadth that hit unique content will be ideally positioned to take advantage of all these platforms and create new
offers and new propositions for consumers. And opportunities to engage more directly with consumers, in terms of
developing those offers, monetizing the viewership, developing databases and the like.
So, I think in many ways, I think, it'll obviously put short-term pressure because the pressure short-term will take time
to build the vehicles that replace the short-term pressures; but as we go forward, I think it's an area of tremendous
growth for us. I mean, I think those have – and again, hit unique content brands at scale are really in the sweet spot to
take advantage of these things.
So, I think our core businesses have a lot of growth left here and overseas in their traditional models, not that some of
those, the models are maturing, but our business is clearly when we look at what we're doing with Fox News, look at
where we are with retransmission rates and the potential there. We think the value of our content holds up.

Yes, certainly, as we said, I think the cable bundle really is pretty much in line with our expectations. I've said before,
probably spring, but I think it's got real legs to it and still is going to be a cornerstone for a long time. But as we go
forward, these digital platforms really open up a whole new dimension in growth on top of the opportunities we have
within the traditional model.
<A - John P. Nallen>: And, Doug, dealing with your question on the local currency affiliate revenue growth
international, it was led by the FIC. STAR had growth, nice growth, but FIC led it. And the business breakdown inside
of that is in our sports channels; it was primarily distribution gains, whereas in our entertainment channels, it was
blended between both distribution gains as well as rate increases.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks John. Thank you very much. Very helpful.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Doug. Operator, could we have next question, please?
Operator
Coming from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thank you very much. I have one question for James and one for Chase. James, over the
past year or so other media companies have made strategic investments internationally in order to achieve more global
scale. Perhaps scale that Fox already has, so for example, Channel 5, Eurosport and [ph] Telemedia (37:01). As you
look to sustain your growth and markets outside the U.S., can you just give us a sense for how you are balancing
organic investment versus M&A?
And then for Chase, you noted the strong ad growth domestically from the FX Networks in the quarter. It does seem
like ratings at FXX have picked up nicely, but FX ratings themselves have seemed to have hit a soft patch. So, I know
you guys have moved some content from FX to FXX, but wondering, is there any concern on those networks? And can
they establish their own distinct identities from each other? Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Sure. Thanks, Anthony, it's James here. First of all, I would say our bias generally is
to – and particularly given the position that we have in markets outside the U.S. today, is generally to invest in
ourselves, and to continue to execute and operate these businesses where we have a reasonable position.
I think it's fair to say that we're pretty happy with the mix that we have around the place. We've completed a number of
transactions over the last number of years from the acquisition of the Asianet business and local regional languages in
India, which really gave us a new dimension to that business, to the acquisition of our partner stakes on ESPN STAR
Sports and Fox Pan-American Sports, and so on.
I think we'll continue to look at acquisitions where we can simplify our business, where we can really add a dimension
and really add velocity and pace to the business. But, we're not looking to fill a whole bunch of gaps, if you will. I think
we have a good position internationally.
And to Chase's point before about long-term growth, I guess it really is one of the drivers of our long-term growth,
when we look at our emerging markets position, particularly in India, in parts of Asia and other parts of Asia and in
Latin America, we feel very, very strong about the position. That's not to say that we rule things out. We'll look
opportunistically at a variety of things, as you would expect. But, we generally, at this point, I think, would have a bias
towards investing in ourselves other than kind of bolt on kind of tactical things that can help us accelerate.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: And I think in FX, may I? And first, I think it's pretty much where we expected. I think we
expected for a couple of years, as we were trying to build FXX side-by-side with FX, we were going to stretch it a bit,
and so I don't think that's a surprise to us.
And ramp up programming to fill out two channels, obviously going from one to two does put some strain on it. That's
where you feel great where the whole thing is. I mean I guess when I look at FX, I probably look at it first

competitively, not in an absolute sense, and especially the whole cable industry, and this has been well reported, is
dealing with the issue of traditional rating declines.
I think FX has held up really well, and I think actually programming continues to, if anything, distinguish itself from
certainly basic cable competitors more and more, and I look at some of the shows they've got coming this year, I think
they're great.
So, I think, we feel very good about it. I think we feel great about it, probably more than very good. I think we knew
there was going to be some pressures and competitively, I think it's very strong, and we're dealing with the same
pressures on ratings that the broader industry is, and I think competitively, sort of doing well.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Anthony. Operator, could we have next question, please?
Operator
From the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thanks. So, my two questions, two different ones. First on TrueX, can you talk a little
bit about how you can best utilize that business to drive Fox's advertising? Can it move the needle?
And the second question, can you go back to the currency impact? I know you were just asked a question on
acquisitions, but given the strength of the dollar, does it change at all your thinking about making acquisitions outside
of the U.S.? Or does it changes the way you might think about the buyback, given the reset on fiscal 2016 guidance? If
there's an impact on your stock price, would it make you accelerate? How are you thinking about, opportunistically, the
impact of currency?
<A - John P. Nallen>: That one first, and then...
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Okay. Thanks, Jessica. It's James. On TrueX, look, it's probably a little early, and
you'll see over the coming weeks and months some further kind of development in terms of the closing of the TrueX
transaction and how that gets embedded in the business. But, we're very excited about it. And really for us, it's about
investing in the capability around ad innovation that we can service and the company as it does service multiple clients
in the industry, but also something that we really think we can hopefully accelerate the roll out of new technology and
some new ad products that we think are really at the forefront of thinking around how you monetize digital viewership,
how you monetize time shift of viewership. And as we see the streaming share of time shifted viewing continue to
grow, vis-à-vis DVRs, really you have to remember that we're really just in the very, very foothills of monetizing that
viewership. And that viewership is very, very large. It's a material percentage above what our live plus three or live
plus seven viewing is.
So, it's really about monetizing the streaming environment and being able to accelerate with new ad products for other
clients, other broadcasters as well as for ourselves. But, there'll be more on that going forward. Fundamentally, it's
about the acquisition of capability within the networks group, and we really think it can move the dial over time.
<A - John P. Nallen>: And I think on the buyback, Jessica, it's John. No, I don't think currency at all changes our view
on how we look at the buyback. As Chase indicated, we're scheduled to complete the current buyback, we'll assess it
again at the end of the year.
I don't think current markets, where we are going to change our pattern or velocity of the buyback for the remainder of
the year, and we'll continue to look to invest in ourselves, as James referred to, and to be opportunistic around
opportunities that come up. But, there's no current plan to change the pace, velocity or size of the current authorization.

<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Jessica, with respect to your question on whether or not currency would change our
view on M&A, a strong dollar would mean something. Because at the end of the day, I think we're always going to be
looking at opportunities around the quality of the businesses and how they're really performing. And the currency
overlay of that is largely secondary.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I think, I mean, in terms of currency, I mean, I think we probably look at the health of
the region in the market, I mean probably – I mean to look. I guess just wanted – if you're looking at Europe, you'll
have to see, got up to sort of have some degree of concerns about having Europe navigates the short-term.
I think, certainly there's a lot of international markets we feel great about. I mean in the case in point, I mean the
developing markets. We're still broadly very excited about; but clearly, you've got to be cognizant of what's going on in
countries, and certainly the currency issues we've had in a place like Argentina are a reflection of sort of broader
economic issues.
So, I think, we'd always take broader economic issues. Long-term broader economic issues into account in terms of
evaluating where we were going to invest; again, though, I think most of our investments, I don't want to repeat it,
would be in the form of building businesses, not making large international acquisitions.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Operator, can we have next question, please?
Operator
Will come from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rich S. Greenfield>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, just first off, just a housekeeping question. Looking
at the solidness of your subscriber revenue streams that showed itself in the first half, when you look at the back half of
the year, given the reduction in full-year guidance, can you just give a sense – you talked about the currency, but what
type of domestic ad market are you looking at for broadcast network stations and cable? Could you just give us some
color on – it sounds like those numbers obviously have to be down pretty substantially, at least for the broadcast
stations and networks, but just some sense of order of magnitude. And will cable also feel that effect versus the strength
you had this quarter?
And then just, I've a big picture question for all of you. When you looked at the rationale for the Time Warner
acquisition attempt over the summer, it seemed to us that a direct-to-consumer business with all of the content the
combined companies would have had versus selling your content to Netflix, was a huge potential benefit. As you look
at what's going on in advertising, and you look at the strength that Netflix keeps growing, does it make it that much
important to revisit that transaction, work out some form of relationship with Time Warner? Just because both of you
could both, in this ad market and the change in consumer, you both could use each other more than ever before.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess, a little call out, in the first part, I guess a little more color on the second half, I mean,
I'll just comment on the ad markets, again because you cited that. What I'd say sort of the ad market since we look at
them today, nationally, I guess to say they're okay, probably not where we might have hoped. I think we came into this
quarter hoping there'd be probably a bit more of renewed budgets and the like. Probably the quarter feels probably like
the fourth quarter, like the December quarter, maybe some shine some rays of light that give you a little hope of the
national markets to be a little better; but I guess, I'd say it's not as robust as we would've hoped in terms of rebound, but
it's okay.
Upfront pricing is still a premium to the scatter. The scatter pricing is a premium to the upfront pricing. So, it's okay. I
would say the local markets are probably softer than the national markets. I think the local markets from a market
perspective as we look at what our expectations are for this year, I think the local markets, yeah, took up.
The market factors had a bigger hit. I mean I guess as you look at sort of what – to provide a little more visibility to sort
of the adjusted guidance. I mean really there's sort of probably three buckets in aggregate that are sort of changes from

when we last looked at it. It's currency. It's the broadcast business and the content piece John touched on and they're
probably all about equal.
I mean to sort of, and probably the better part of – and I'll use round numbers, a better part of $100 million in each and
I think we talked about the currency being $100 million, I think broadcast. And again, the content which is a
combination of Shine being probably a significant event; and then to a lesser extent, the Christmas releases that didn't
pan out.
In the broadcast piece, it's probably our biggest rating as we already took. In the first quarter, we knew our ratings were
short; and to a large degree, our content upside offset the rating's shortfalls. Probably ratings are a little bit worse, but
then our expectations in the quarter, but that sort of $100 million is probably a bit of ratings, sports, as John touched on
was a little soft.
Our two big conference championship games were blowouts. Our two biggest regular-season games, John gave the
average part clearly – all did not pan out. The NFL was a touch behind in our big 4:00 games in the last quarter. So, the
$100 million is up a little bit.
And clearly, the station market, I think we were expecting sort of a – and I think we talked about it going into the year
– a low-single, we weren't expecting much, but we were sort of expecting a low single-digit 1% to 2% market growth
and probably looks like now a low to mid decline percentage.
We do $1 billion in six months in that business, so if you got a 5% swing, it's $50 million. So, if you add the broadcast
pieces up, and say it's $50 million in the stations and $20 million to $25 million in sports, the biggest piece being the
college games, another piece on the ratings on top of what really was largely we anticipated in the September quarter,
that sort of gives you the pieces. And the offset we had in content went the other way, with Shine being pulled out and
a couple of Christmas pictures not being what we thought they'd be.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Time Warner.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Time Warner. No, we're not. I won't give my moved-on spiel, but we've moved on. Time
Warner was not a necessity for us. And the issues we're facing today, we feel very excited about. I think we have a
breadth of content that enables us to navigate the space. You talk about Netflix. I think from the get-go, our approach to
the SVOD space, Netflix, in particular, specifically, the SVOD space in general has been to be disciplined about it, to
make sure we participate in that business, adhering to sort of rules that, first and foremost, defend the value, enable us
to continue to grow our core businesses, which is the networks, and make sure we're enlarging our overall pie, not
cannibalizing our core businesses in an adverse way to the extent of short-term dollars.
So, we have been disciplined in terms in which we do it. In reality, our recent SVOD deals have been actually with
Amazon and Hulu Plus. So, we think that's a positive, that you've got a more competitive marketplace than you've had
there. But we will, and we'll continue to ensure that we're not going to take actions that would prioritize short-term
profits from a sale at the expense of the health of our long-term businesses.
I think we've been true to that, to-date, in these things and we will continue to ensure that we grow our overall business.
And that's certainly a rule, a principle we'll stay true to as we develop the opportunities in the digital platforms. We
think there are real opportunities to develop ways to offer our product in new and exciting ways, and we have to figure
out what are the right models for those, we're doing a lot of work on that. We're obviously engaging with some third
parties. We did announce we concluded a deal with Sony. We're talking to others.
But in all these cases, we're going to ensure we do things that enable us to grow our overall business, not cannibalize it.
And we think we have the franchises and the content that puts us in a leadership position – to be must-have content,
with essentially, not everybody. Meaning somebody can create a package that doesn't have our content in, but I think
our content at its core is content that really is central to the video business. And we are confident in our ability to
navigate that and to ensure an exciting future for us.

We'll go to the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Okay. Thanks very much. Just a quick follow-up on your last answer there, Chase. Would the
buckets, being sort of equal contribution from content, FX and broadcasting, would the relationship be the same for
fiscal 2016 as well as fiscal 2015, like equal contribution to the hit in original guidance?
And the second question is, you guys launched an interesting new initiative with some partners for local ratings,
beta-ing in the Dallas market. I think it's the new Queen rating service. Can you talk about that effort? Why you
launched it and what your ambitions for it are. Thanks very much.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah. I guess first on 2016, I'd say that I think we talked about currency number next year
being another approximately $200 million hit, clearly the broadcast business goes forward off a base that – 2015 will
provide a base to go forward, so in many ways that carries through, and probably we're a little bit – I think in the
broadcast business, where we are is a little behind, we're behind, we're a few years behind the curve we expected to be
on. I think we believe the values we talked about in the broadcast business will be there. But, we're not in the point of
the growth curve we expect to be on.
As I said, we're probably investing a bit more in sort of focusing on stabilizing the business next year as opposed to
prioritizing growing profits. So, certainly the broadcast business will carry through. The one that I'd say is in the film
issues were really one time. We expected Shine to be out a year-ago, we didn't, but certainly when we talked about this
year, we expected Shine to be out in 2016, and the films are always one-time events, so there's nothing recurring about
the content fees.
<Q - David Bank>: Okay. On new rating?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: And on the new ratings, I am not going to make the measurement issue a scapegoat for all
the issues, so I think there's a valid issue. I don't think we're happy with the measurement tools that exist out there,
particularly as all this viewership continues to move in new and different places, and we're going to do everything we
can to try and get a more accurate and improved ability to measure viewership.
And so we're going to continue to pursue any opportunities that present us the ability to do it as well as working with
Nielsen, we'll certainly continue to work with them. But clearly, we think there are issues in terms of the accuracy of
measurement and the ability of our current measurement tools to keep up with really where the viewership's going. It is
clearly moving to places that really aren't being captured and adequately measured today. So, I think we have to be
proactive about trying to find solutions.

Will come from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Thank you. I think my question is for James. James, now and then we hear this argument
from investors that there is an over-supply of content out there, because of both for scripted entertainment and sports,
as a result of networks producing more SVOD services, and so on. So, clearly as a company you don't believe that, so I
wonder if you can tell us what you think the floor is in this over-supply argument? And if you think it's even ever
possible for it to happen in one of the categories? Thank you.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks very much. I'm sure Chase will want to weigh in on this as well, but I think
there's no question that there's just an absolutely enormous amount of original production going on right now. I think
it's less driven by the SVOD services, and really just driven by cable network programmers getting into dramatic series

production by and large. And increasing volumes, and the numbers are still going up.
But I think it's really important to remember that one hour of scripted television is very, very different from another
hour of scripted television. So, the total volume isn't really the question. The right question is what are you making?
How do you make it great? How do you stand out? And can you be a place that can attract the great show runners, the
great writers, the great talent to come and do incredible work?
And I think we're very, very confident that creatively the teams across 21st Century Fox Companies can continue to
execute. They've been executing very well. But, it's not really a question of a volume game, it's a question of how do
you make stuff that's genuinely distinctive in that environment where you have so much consumer choice?
And I think the thing that exacerbates the competitive dynamic around it is that in – with the availability of streaming
platforms and the availability of vast libraries of scripted programming, you're really competing with not just what's on
in the same hour, but you're competing with everything that's come before. And that's something that is a great creative
challenge, but one that we feel is our core business to try to rise to and to try to get great people to do that.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes, I guess all I'd add simplistically, is – what there's not certainly an over-supply of is hit
programming. And that's what it's all about. There may be over-supply, but realistically, there is an over-supply of
mediocre programming, but hits are gold. And I think the real question is who's positioned, and there's a ton of product
out there, so a ton of competition, who is positioned, best positioned, to create the hit programming of tomorrow? And
who has the assets and the breadth and the relationships and the scale?
I think there'll be winners and losers. I think the business you see today will not be what the business looks like in a few
years, and I do think there'll be winners and losers, and I think it's a question of who are going to be the winners? Who
are those who are positioned to have the best opportunity and the best position to create the hits of tomorrow? And we
think we're in a great place, and that's our goal.
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Vasily. Could we have next question, please, operator?

Will come from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: All right. Thanks. At this point let me try to keep it very short and sweet. Could you just tell us
for your fully-distributed U.S. domestic cable networks, would you say that total subscribers year-over-year are flat, up,
or down? And in your long-range plans, what is your anticipation or expectation for the basic trend of that, basically
total full-line multi-channel pay-TV subscribers? That's it. Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I'd say they are down a touch. I'm not even sure it's 1%, but it's sort of – they're down a
touch and that's pretty much in line with our expectations. I've use the phrase fraying, so I'll use it again. And we think
whether it's a combination of millennials and economic pressures at the margins, we've expected it. And I think right
now what we're seeing is pretty much in line with our expectations.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Todd. Could we have next question, please?

Will come from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: [indiscernible] (60:53) different questions. First of all, how would you characterize the
relationship between the broadcast network and the stations at this point, just in general? And then second, any interest
or conversation with the FCC with regards to the incentive auction that we still don't know if it'll go off in 2016 but

suppose it does? Thank you.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: When you say broadcast network and stations, do you mean our third-party affiliates?
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Yes.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Or do you mean our O&Os?
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: No, third-party affiliates.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Okay. It's a good relationship. We are obviously navigating new times and certainly we're
committed to working with them. We value the relationship with the affiliates, we value the business model with them.
There's no question in a dual revenue world where we believe our programming is what drives the subscription side of
it, we are navigating new arenas to create the terms of commerce for us between them. And so, I think, not surprisingly,
there's some of those get to be – conversations with some friction in them, but we've had a good and healthy
relationship, and I think our goal is to – which we've been able to do.
Really, most of our affiliates, we've continued to work with and our goal is to continue to find ways to work with them.
So, I think, anytime you're sort of navigating new business models, and that's really in many ways what we're doing
with them, I think there'll be some frictions as you work through it. But, our goal is to find something, our goal is to
find a fair solution.
We think our programming is valuable, we think it deserves to be – we deserve compensation for that programming.
And I recognize fair is in the eyes of the beholder, but that's what we're looking and expecting to get is fair
compensation for our programming. And that's our goal, is to kind of work that out with them. What was the second
question?
<A - John P. Nallen>: The FCC.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: The FCC and...
<A - John P. Nallen>: The incentive auctions.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Incentive auctions look. I think it's certainly something we're taking seriously, we're engaged
in, and some of the numbers get thrown around, certainly are pretty interesting. If you look at the auction that has just
concluded, and it certainly probably adds to that interest. So, if we don't know enough, there's still stuff to be flushed
out, but certainly we are fully engaged. We've got a big station group; and in reality, two big station groups if you
include MyNet as a group. So, we've got a lot of stations and a lot of spectrum. So, I think, we certainly are fully
engaged and want to understand more about the opportunity there. There's certainly a number of signs that say it could
be interesting.

Will come from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies LLC. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thanks. Just one please. Chase, I think the growth at the domestic cable networks is noteworthy
in the backdrop of the broader narrative you guys discussed around the ad market. And when we look at your next call
the market's going to be talking about the upfront. So with the viewing of content moving to multiple platforms, and the
revenue impact related to the measurement issues, do you have a view on the potential to deemphasize the upfront
process? Or maybe information flow, given the backdrop that marketers are also changing how they buy?

<A - Charles G. Carey>: I don't think, I mean, certainly I'm sitting here, I mean we're not going to make projections
about the upfront, but I don't think sort of four months away from now you'll be, we're going to have a dramatically
different approach. Look, but we are certainly changing how we're approaching the ad market.
As I touched on, we have restructured our entire ad sales organization; and in many ways, the primary reason for doing
that would position us to deal with the world going forward. I mean, there were some costs that came out, but the
objective, that's a secondary consideration, those are just efficiency moves.
Our objective in reorganizing and restructuring the ad sales organization was to position us to deal with the world we
expect to be competing, which again, has viewership moving to other places and advertisers, not surprisingly, wanting
a lot of the attributes of efficiency and effectiveness that come with the digital platforms.
We have to make sure we're positioned to take advantage of that. So, I think that's a priority. I'm not sure in terms of
we'll be doing it starting today, not even the upfront, so the upfront is part of that process, but certainly the way we're
approaching the impression the entire ad market is in a state of transition. I will say on the digital, while a lot of these, a
lot of moneys, clearly there's a lot of desire there.
I think one of the things we hope to do and I think our concept because it's so important it could help, is, yeah, it's still
unclear to what degree our advertisers are getting value out of the digital marketplace. That may be what is R&D
spending, which probably has a logic to it; but I think it's unclear in many places. Are they getting value for that
spending or they chasing sort of goals in terms of attributes without knowing where they're getting the value for it?
So, I think, we hope we can add a dimension that sort of enables them to ensure by having content that really I think is
a sweet spot that we're able to really deliver on the value that gets associated with those digital platforms.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, John. Can we have next question please, operator?

Will come from Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Barton E. Crockett>: Okay. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the dividend in the context
of your comment earlier that you are now in an over-capitalized position. It's great and encouraging to see the 20% hike
in the recurring dividend. But, I was wondering if you could talk about what drove the analysis that got you there. And
as you look at your capitalized position, what are your feelings about maybe using more of that for dividend, either
recurring or special?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's like I said, it is a topic the board is engaged in broadly. It's
buybacks, dividends, I don't want to get too far in front of the board in terms of talking about plans or initiatives. I think
all I'd really say is just generally we've been clear, we think, return of capital to shareholders is an important part of our
overall philosophy.
And the dividend, we look our business, we have confidence in our business, and we think, it's appropriate. And we
certainly thought this move is appropriate, and I think we're going to discuss further what's the balance between
buybacks and dividends and overall speed of with which we return the capital through those various vehicles.
But I think, it is something we're committed to; and again, we will certainly have more meeting next week and so that
we continue to discuss where we should be, and it's a process we take seriously.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Barton. Operator, it's starting to run late, but we have time for one more question.

<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you. Just a question on the broadcast network and your earlier commentary about
reinvesting in it and hoping to stabilize the broadcast business. I guess, if you give us some color of how constrained
you are from an inventory perspective with make-goods, to take advantage of maybe some improvement in demand
down the road. How far out are those make-goods eating up the inventory? How much flexibility you have in them.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Actually, in the broadcast system, we don't really have a make-good issue. Again, we
probably don't have the inventory we might have for the scatter market. We're in the scatter market; but from a
make-good perspective, we don't really have anything that would be out of the ordinary course for us on a make-good.
We have opportunity as the year goes along through various vehicles and events at times to address. Obviously, we are
short on our ratings; they're not where we expected. So, we have to deal with that, but we're pretty good at dealing with
that on an ongoing basis; not letting it stockpile. And that's certainly true today where we are.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you very much.
