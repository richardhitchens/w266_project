presentation. Now that that's covered, let me turn it over to Grayson.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, List, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and appreciate you taking the time to
participate in our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call.
Regions performed well in the third quarter, growing both fee-based revenue and bottom-line profits as we continued to
successfully execute our business plans and realize continued asset quality improvement. Earnings per share from
continuing operations was $0.22 per diluted share.
Our third quarter performance builds on a solid first half of 2012 and reflects the positive change underway at Regions,
change that is better positioning us for long-term outperformance and change that is enabling us to prudently and
properly grow our business and expand.
Our customer base – despite a sluggish and uneven operating environment, to accomplish this, Regions has been and
continues to be focused on diversifying and building our revenue sources, streamlining our processes to better serve our
customers, improving our productivity and efficiency and providing new technology that supports our customers'
ever-changing needs, ensuring superior risk management and further strengthening our balance sheet.
Turning to third quarter results, you can see further evidence of the progress that we're making. Fee income posted
strong growth during the third quarter driven by record mortgage banking revenues. Mortgage continued to benefit
from HARP II refinancing and total refinancings improved 15% from the second quarter. Through HARP II, we have
refinanced $1.2 billion on home mortgages through the end of September. Notably, approximately 50% of the
applications were customers new to Regions Mortgage. Total loan production increased 2% linked quarter, fueled by
mortgage and indirect auto.
Loans outstanding were down 1% as customers continued to deleverage and political and economic uncertainty weighs
on demand. However, commercial and industrial loan growth remain healthy, helping to somewhat offset the [ph]
favorable (04:01) decline in investor real estate portfolio. We continued to improve our funding mix, growing our low
cost deposits while reducing our high rate time deposits and there is further opportunity for improvement in deposit
cost and funding mix.
Let me also point out that according to the FDIC Deposit Data recent release, we have maintained our top five market
share position in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and in Tennessee. In the third quarter, our net
interest margin declined sequentially, partially due to a prolonged low interest rate environment. David Turner will
provide more details in just a moment.
The Federal Reserve's QE3 program announced mid September calls for purchases of large quantities of
mortgage-backed security for an indefinite period, driving down reinvestment yields and putting greater longer-lasting
pressure on yields than we previously assumed. While the third quarter decline in our net interest margin was
disappointing, we are hopeful that we will be able to hold it and our net interest income reasonably steady over the next
several quarters while improving funding cost partially offsetting these pressures. Keep in mind that our low
loan-deposit ratio provides considerable opportunity to add probable loans to our balance sheet once customers have
greater confidence in the economic and political outlook and are more willing to borrow.
Let's move onto expenses. As discussed previously, expense control remains a top priority at Regions and we are
focused daily on identifying opportunities to improve our productivity and cost structure while providing products and
services that our customers want and deserve. Today, into the third quarter, we continued implementation of new
technology in our branches that will not only lower operating costs but will improve cross-sell capabilities and enhance
the overall customer experience in Regions' branches.
During the quarter, we also completed the conversion of our credit card portfolio to Regions' systems introducing a new
suite of card offerings and launched a new card advertising campaign. Although these actions resulted in elevated third

quarter expenses, we are confident that they will provide attractive long-term returns. Currently only about 14% of our
customers has a Regions' credit card.
Over time, we believe we can increase penetration rates to more than 20%. Importantly, we delivered another quarter of
asset quality improvement, allowing us to invest more of our time and resources in developing and executing profitable
growth strategies. Simply put, Regions is transitioning to growth, prudent and profitable growth, while current low
interest rates, subpar economic growth, and political uncertainty, are creating headwinds, we are making solid progress
executing our business plans and building a foundation that is better positioning Regions for long-term outperformance.
Before I turn the call over to David, let me briefly note that earlier today, we announced that assuming market
conditions are favorable, we do expect to consider issuing preferred stock in the near future. David will elaborate a bit
more later; however, we're limited in terms of what we can discuss at the time in this meeting. Let me turn the call over
to David who will discuss the third quarter financial details. Afterwards, I will come back and make a few closing
comments before taking questions. David?
David J. Turner, Jr.
Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin on slide three with a quick snapshot of our third
quarter 2012 financial results. We reported net income available to common shareholders from continuing operations of
$312 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. Pre-tax pre-provision income from continuing operations or PPI was $481
million. Net interest income was $817 million and the resulting net interest margin was 3.08%. Non-interest revenues
increased 5% on a linked quarter basis and total revenue increased $5 million linked quarter. Non-interest expenses
were up 3% and from a credit standpoint, net charge-offs were steady linked quarter while the total loan loss provision
was $33 million.
Let's get into some of the details starting with the balance sheet. Overall balance sheet trends this quarter were driven
by continued growth in our commercial and industrial portfolio as well as indirect auto. However, this growth was
offset by declines in investor real estate and owner-occupied commercial real estate. As a result, average loans for the
third quarter were down $973 million, or 1% linked quarter.
Average balances were impacted by a decline of $623 million or 6% in investor real estate portfolio. At quarter end,
investor real estate stood at $8.7 billion, down $3.2 billion from one year ago. This portfolio now comprises only 12%
of our total loan portfolio compared to 15% a year ago. But we expect this portfolio to continue to decline, however, at
a moderate pace over the next several quarters.
Our owner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio, which is comprised primarily of community banking and small
business, and which tends to exhibit the same behavioral trends as consumers, declined this quarter largely due to
deleveraging. Linked quarter, we experienced a loan decline of $338 million or 3%. Although price competition has
increased, a majority of the decline was related to payoffs, prepayments and scheduled pay-downs. However, as noted,
commercial and industrial loan demand remained solid in the third quarter, driven by our integrated approach to
specialized lending where our local bankers work with experienced, specialized lenders to meet customer needs. Total
production for this portfolio was a solid $9.7 billion.
During the quarter, we transferred $185 million of remaining loans related to the Morgan Keegan sale off of our
balance sheet. Excluding these loans, commercial and industrial loans on an ending basis grew $570 million, or 2.2%
linked quarter.
Pipelines remain solid and are slightly above the same level at this time last year as our clients fund capital
expenditures, working capital needs and, increasingly, M&A activity. Line utilization on commercial and industrial
loans was up 60 basis points to 43.9% and commitments have increased 12% over the last year.
Our consumer services portfolio, which makes up 39% of our total loan portfolio, remained steady this quarter despite
consumer deleveraging and our continued strategy to sell fixed rate conforming mortgages. As I will discuss in a
minute, these sales led to a material increase in mortgage income this quarter.

Declines in our home equity portfolio continue as customers take advantage of opportunities to refinance. However,
this quarter we launched a new home equity loan product to attract a new set of customers that will increase our overall
home equity production.
Now moving onto credit card, as Grayson mentioned, during the quarter, we successfully converted the servicing of our
Regions' branded credit card portfolios. It's important to note that we are focused on expanding our relationships with
our current customers now that we can better control their experience with us. Although overall credit card balances are
down, due to consumer deleveraging, year-to-date production has increased 44% compared to the same period in 2011.
Indirect auto experienced a record quarter of production since we reentered the business in the second quarter of 2011.
Loan production in this portfolio increased 10% over last quarter and average loan balances increased 6.3%. Currently,
we have over 1,700 dealers in our network and plan to have over 2,000 by year-end, all within our existing footprint. In
total, consumer loan production increased 7% linked quarter, totaling $3 billion in the third quarter. Total loan yields
were down 11 basis points linked quarter to 4.18% due to the prolonged low rate environment and increasing pricing
competition, primarily within our middle market segment.
Moving on to deposits as shown on slide five. Deposit mix and cost continued to improve in the third quarter. Average
low cost deposits increased $385 million from last quarter and $4.3 billion from one year ago. Average time deposits
fell to just 16% of total deposits, down from 22% a year ago as a result of our continued success in repricing these
deposits and growing low-cost deposits. This positive repricing and mix shift resulted in deposit costs declining to 28
basis points for the quarter, down four basis points from second quarter and 18 basis points from one year ago. And we
expect to drive additional improvement in deposit cost.
We have approximately $3 billion of CDs that are scheduled to mature in the fourth quarter that carry an average
interest rate of 2.1%. Looking ahead to 2013, we currently have $7.2 billion of CDs that will mature. Of that, $4.9
billion mature in the first half with an average rate of 1.69% and $2.3 billion in the second half with an average rate of
0.66%. This compares to our current average going-on rates for new CDs of approximately 20 basis points. Further, our
overall total funding cost improved to 56 basis points, a decrease of 4 basis points linked quarter and 19 basis points
year-over-year.
Now let's turn to net interest income on slide six. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $830
million, down 2% or $20 million linked quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.08%, down 8 basis points from
second quarter's 3.16%. As a reminder, last quarter included approximately 3 basis points of temporary lift resulting
from a larger than normal volume of full payoff of interest and principal on non-accruing loans.
Overall, prepayments and reinvestment of maturities of higher rate fixed loans and investments contributed
approximately 6 basis points of net interest margin compression and $16 million of net interest income pressure
quarter-over-quarter. Of course, an offset to mortgage prepayments is the positive impact associated with mortgage
non-interest revenue, which I will discuss in further detail shortly. Also, the low rate environment increases the
unrealized profits associated with our investment portfolio.
Through QE3, the Federal Reserve has sustained and recently intensified its efforts to keep interest rates low. As a
result, interest rates on long-term fixed rate mortgages are at record lows as are yields in agency mortgage-back
securities. Therefore, it will be challenging to grow net interest income and net interest margin materially if the current
economic conditions persist. However, we continue to see opportunities to protect the margin by further reducing
deposit cost, which will help to support a relatively stable margin into 2013.
As Grayson alluded to earlier, assuming market conditions are favorable, we expect to consider issuing preferred stock
in the near future. If commenced, the proceeds from this issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, which
may include redeeming certain trust-preferred securities. At this time, we are not able to make any additional comments
regarding this potential issuance.
Let's turn to non-interest revenue on slide seven. Third quarter non-interest revenue was up 5% linked quarter.
Mortgage banking revenue reached a record high in the quarter driven by refinances and new home purchases aided by

the government's HARP II program. Approximately 63% of mortgage loans were refinances and 37% were new home
purchases and 21% of total loans were HARP II related. Earlier in the year, we established a goal to reach $1 billion in
HARP II-related loan production and as of the end of this quarter, we reached $1.2 billion exceeding our original goal
by over $200 million.
As a result, mortgage revenue totaled $106 million, up 18% over second quarter and more than 50% over the prior
year. Mortgage loan production of approximately $2.2 billion during the third quarter reflects an 8% increase from $2.1
billion in the second quarter. We've been able to increase market share by providing customer's access to local market
mortgage bankers and increased capacity through two new HARP loan production facilities.
Let's move onto expenses on slide eight. Non-interest expenses totaled $869 million, an increase of 3% linked quarter.
During the quarter, credit-related expenses increased $12 million primarily attributable to quarter-over-quarter
fluctuations in net gains realized on held for sale property, specifically last quarter, credit-related expenses benefited
from net gains of $26 million as compared to $17 million of gains in the third quarter. Also, other real estate expenses
increased $3 million linked quarter. In addition, marketing expenses were elevated this quarter, due to the credit card
conversion. Salaries and benefits were also up 4% linked quarter, partially related to an increase in incentives
associated with record mortgage production and an increase in long-term incentives.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect overall 2012 expenses from continuing operations to be down from the 2011
level excluding the 2011 goodwill impairment as a result of our continued and disciplined focus on cost control.
Let's look at our credit metrics on slide nine. We continued to make progress with respect to asset quality in the third
quarter as several credit metrics improved including criticized loans, non-performing loans and net charge-offs. Net
charge-offs were down 1% linked quarter and exceeded the loan loss provision by $229 million, resulting in a total loan
loss provision of $33 million. Inflows of non-performing loans increased to $463 million from $315 million linked
quarter but are down 39% from last year. As the increase is primarily driven by the seasonality of our credit process, it
does not impact our overall expectations for continued gradual improvement in credit metrics.
During the quarter, we had one customer loan for $40 million that transferred into non-performing loans and was
subsequently resolved prior to September 30. Additionally, there were approximately $30 million of letters of credit
that funded at quarter end, resulting in non-performing loans. We currently estimate that we have approximately $300
million to $400 million of potential problem commercial and investor real estate loans, which could migrate into
non-performing status in the fourth quarter. Non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $31 million
or 2% linked quarter. Held for sale loans decreased $68 million or 34% linked quarter and other real estate owned
decreased $17 million or 8%.
As a result, total non-performing assets decreased $116 million or 5% linked quarter, but were down 35% from the
prior year. Notably, Business Services criticized and classified loans, one of the best and earliest indicators of asset
quality improvement, continued to decline with criticized loan down 6% or $305 million from the second quarter and
down $2.2 billion or 30% from last year. Our coverage ratios remained solid. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to
non-performing loans stood at 109%, or 1.1 times. Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance to loans was 2.74% at the end
of the third quarter. Based on what we know today, we expect continued improvement in asset quality going forward.
Let's take a look at capital and liquidity on slide ten. Our capital position remained strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio
at the end of the quarter stood at 11.5% and our estimated Tier 1 common ratio increased 50 basis points to 10.5%.
Tangible book value reached $7.02 per share in the third quarter, up from $6.69 in the second quarter, which is an
increase of 5% linked quarter. We are waiting to receive additional feedback regarding the proposed Basel III NPRs;
however, based on our interpretation of the NPRs, we estimate our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will be
approximately 8.7%. The NPR comment period has ended and changes could result which could differ materially from
capital ratios that we've estimated. Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remain solid, with a
loan-deposit ratio of 79%.
And lastly, based on our interpretation, we are well positioned with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio. So, in
closing, this quarter's results reflect our ongoing efforts to focus on what we can control. We increased loan production

by 2% over last quarter. We achieved record mortgage revenues, asset quality improved and we continue to focus on
providing our customers with new and innovative products and services that help them succeed financially, and with
that, I'll turn it back to Grayson for his closing remarks.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, David. Regions is entering the final quarter of 2012 with a solid foundation for growth, a foundation that
we're strengthening each and every quarter. We are diversifying and improving our business mix to help maximize our
growth opportunities as well as identifying and building profitable revenue streams that have the potential to expand
throughout the current economic cycle.
We are focused on improving our productivity and efficiency, including controlling our day-to-day expenses,
undertaking initiatives to streamline operations and investing in technology that enhances delivery and productivity.
We're working hard to understand customers' needs and offer advice, guidance and the best products and services that
will help them make better financial decisions.
We believe we can create the kind of shared value our communities need to thrive, offering competitive products that
are delivered in transparent and trustworthy manner. And finally, we remain disciplined in our risk management,
committed to growth that is both prudent and profitable. While our work isn't complete, I am confident the business
plans we're executing will lead to ultimate outperformance for Regions and reward our stakeholders over the long term.
Operator, with that, we're now ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Pancari of Evercore Partners.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: A little bit more about your margin outlook here. I know you indicated that you expect a
relatively stable outlook but can you help us quantify your expectations just given the compression we saw on the loan
yield and the securities yield this quarter, just curious how that may interpret into continued compression further out?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, John, this is David. We – just to make sure we level-set, as I mentioned in my
prepared comments, we were at 3.16% in the last quarter, second quarter. We had guided to 3.13% being kind of the
normal recurring margin for that quarter given that we had three points of favorable interest reversals. From that, we
had indicated we would be relatively stable. Obviously, QE3 came in in the latter part of the quarter which put pressure
on rates, in particular, the reinvestments that we have in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. We are doing a
couple of things. I mentioned the amount of deposits that we have maturing in the fourth quarter and the improvement
in our diversification of our investment portfolio.
So, when you look at some of the things we're doing in the investment portfolio, changing that risk profile, moving in
new investments into new issue CMBS and corporate bonds, we think that that will serve to offset some of the
downward pressure we see in the reinvestment rates. So, with that, we believe we can guide to a stable margin from
where we are today, and when we say relatively stable, you can look at where we are today and give us a point or two
either way but we think those will be relatively stable in the fourth quarter and into 2013.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right and then secondly, back to credit. I know you indicated the potential movement
of $300 million to $400 million of investor real estate owned to NPL status for the quarter. Can you give us a little bit
more color on what you're seeing there? What types of loans are these and what changed during the quarter to highlight
these?

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Would be glad to. When you look at the guidance we've given you after the second quarter,
we thought the migration to non-performing status would be in the $300 million to $400 million range. If you look at
what happened in the quarter, and you look at sort of our loan portfolio today and in particular the distressed loans in
our portfolio, we've really gotten our portfolio down to the point that even though we've gotten very granular, there still
is the opportunity for just a handful of credits to move that number from one quarter to another.
If you look at our overall credit trends, we continue to be favorably encouraged. Most of our trends have a very
favorable direction to them, and if you look at the composition of those loans, we continue to believe that for the fourth
quarter, we'll be back in that $300 million to $400 million range. In addition, as David had indicated earlier, if you look
at there were a few credits that were late in the quarter making that transition but early in this quarter leaving that status
we still continue to be encouraged by the level of resolutions that we're seeing and I think that as we move forward, we
still remain confident that our quality – the quality of our loan assets is improving and I'll ask Barb Godin, our Chief
Credit Officer to add some color to that.
<A - Barbara Godin>: I think the only other thing I would say, John, beyond what Grayson said, is I would remind
everyone that typically our third quarter is our seasonal quarter and for the last couple of quarters as you'll note or last
couple of years – I'm sorry, as you'll note, our third quarter typically goes up followed by a better fourth quarter. I'm
going to anticipate that seasonal pattern continuing again as we saw look through the numbers and what saw coming in,
there was nothing that really stood out.
I would also note that 53% of our non-performing loans in total are now current and paying as agreed on the Business
Services side, an improvement from the 46% we saw last quarter. So, again, there's nothing of major note that we saw
or nothing that was disturbing that we saw coming in. As we did point out, there were a couple of large items that
moved that number this quarter and again we hope to – even the letters of credit, have those resolved as we move into
the fourth quarter.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, like we've said before, there's going to be some unevenness in our numbers from
quarter to quarter, but from our perspective, no change in our direction. Our direction is still moving in the same
direction that it has been for the past several quarters.
<Q - John Pancari>: So, no impact on charge-offs or provision as a result of this move that you're expecting?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: No. In fact, we look at our portfolio today, the composition of our past portfolio, our prime
portfolio, continues to improve. As well as Barb mentioned, the composition of our non-performing part of our
portfolio, like she just said, 52% of it is paying as agreed. We feel like we've got it appropriately reserved and while our
level non-performing loans are high relative to our peer group, so, we think that our charge-offs will stay elevated for
some period of time but our allowance is sufficient to cover that and we've continued to keep a higher allowance.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Okay, thanks. Just a follow-up to John's questions on the margin. Can you give us a sense of
how much premium amortization there is left in the portfolio and I believe, David, you commented that you are hopeful
to keep NII flat but if you look, you're seeing loan yields compress. We only saw one month of QE in the quarter. So,
do you think you can actually grow the loan portfolio over the next few quarters to offset margin pressure?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: well, your first answer is we have about $1 billion in premium amortization and booked
premium at the end of the quarter. And in terms of loan growth, we obviously are working hard but want to be prudent
with regards to the loans we've put on. We want to make sure we're being paid for the risk we take and demand is
challenged, especially in the small business and commercial middle market.

That being said, we are continuing to have an increase in production, nice increases quarter-over-quarter and we
believe that the investor real estate, which ran off about $700 million this past quarter starts to moderate, declining but
at a moderate pace. We did have $200 million. I think I had mentioned that $185 million in my prepared comments of
loans that we – as part of the previously-established agreement in the Morgan Keegan transaction to sell those. So,
that's $200 million that you won't see coming out in the future quarter. So, we will continue to work to grow loans,
which would help us stabilize and increase our net interest income.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think if I could just add to that real quick is that when you look at our loan production, we
continue to be very confident in our ability to produce loans outstanding. To David's – if you sort of walk through our
different lines of business, we're seeing good, strong growth in commercial, industrial, and indirect auto and in
mortgage but we've made a few decisions that certainly are impacting our net loans outstanding at the end of the
quarter and that is, number one, we're not holding a lot of our mortgage production.
Most of our mortgage production we're releasing that and – into the secondary market, and if you look at our
commercial real estate, as David said, it was – investor commercial real estate was down approximately $700 million
for the quarter and we released $185 million as part of the Morgan Keegan/Raymond James transaction and net-net that
was the decline in our loan portfolio. And so, we continue to be encouraged by production as deleveraging by
customers starts to slow down, I think we can start to see some decent growth out of our portfolio.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Okay and this is a question for both – I guess for both Grayson and David. When you think
about performance, and we obviously saw top-line pressure from declining margins and we did see expenses increase.
Now I know you noted that expenses will be down year-over-year and it makes sense you are trying to invest for
growth in the future. But can you talk about some of things that you're doing internally to control expenses? And as you
look out, assuming we don't see a huge change in the revenue and growth environment, at what point do you start to
take a hard look at expenses, particularly on the branch side and start to take out some significant costs? Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I think that we've had a focus on expenses for quite some time and expenses were up
third quarter versus second quarter as David mentioned earlier. Part of that increase in expenses obviously was our
credit card portfolio conversion. We spent quite a bit of money there, not only on the conversion itself but on the
advertising of that in communication with our customers and as well as increased staffing to accommodate the
telephone calls and the support of those customers as they went through that transition.
But when you look at expenses overall, we continue to drive down total staffing in the company, become more
efficient. We've been heavy investors in technology. We've implemented quite a few new technology projects in the
last few months that have really improved our efficiency, but at the same time improved our service level. If you look
over the last four years, we've probably consolidated our branch franchise more than any of our peer group and
continue to look at ways to extract efficiency out of our branches. I think you should anticipate that we'll continue to
have a strong focus on expense management.
That being said, there still are times when we're going to spend to grow. We've got opportunities to grow our business
and as our business managers and market managers come to the table with ideas where we can spend some money to
grow this organization in a prudent and thoughtful manner, we're going to take advantage of those opportunities but
you should anticipate core expenses will continue to incrementally decline over time.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: I was going to add to that. I did want to point out that you mentioned expenses were up,
revenue was up as well and expenses we pointed out a couple of things that shouldn't be recurring. I would tell you
there we're in the middle of budget season as is everybody else. There's not a meeting that we don't go to where we talk
about expenses at the end of the day and it is every expense that we incur that we continue to challenge ourselves on
that spend. We do want to make sure that we're making investments for the future though and we will continue to do
that as Grayson mentioned. So, you haven't heard a named expense initiative from us. You will not because it's
something we do each and every day and we'll give you more guidance in terms of what we think expenses for 2013
will look like on the next call.

<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Just as maybe a quick follow-up, how much core expense are you actually taking out versus
how much are you reinvesting in technology and growth for the future? Thanks.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Well, just different projects have different – I don't have a number – a consolidated
number in terms of how much savings we have that we've reinvested. Really don't look at it that way. We look at
making investments that are prudent that pay themselves back in a reasonable period of time and also help from a
customer service standpoint. So, we can get back to you and get a more definitive answer on that, Ryan.

Your next question comes from Erika Penala of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Hi, I just wanted to follow up on some of the questions with regards to the NPL trends and I
wanted to make sure we were taking away the right thing. Of the $463 million in gross NPL additions this quarter,
David, am I interpreting it right that $40 billion – or $40 million of that was subsequently resolved after the quarter?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Erika, it was resolved within the quarter. What we did is we believed that had those not
been resolved by September 30, they would have been in NPL. So we thought the right thing to do was to show that
gross migration. So it's not in NPL because the loans are gone but we showed it transferring in gross and then we have
resolved – when you look at our supplement, you'll see it coming – you can't – it's embedded in the resolutions, but in
and out in the same quarter.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But the $463 million is a gross migration and the $40 million was netted out of total NPLs.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: I see, and, Barb, could you explain to us what is unique about your markets or your loan
portfolio that you typically have a seasonal increase in NPLs in the third quarters?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Certainly, Erika. What we do is we continue to credit service our loans throughout the year but
again as we look at the spring when everyone files their taxes, we sit down and we have that much harder look with the
audited tax returns from our customers and have those conversations with them as well as getting updated appraisals.
And just by those sheer conversations, if we hear anything in those discussions from our customers that leads us to
believe that we may not get paid back our full principal and interest completely over the time horizon, we will then go
ahead and make that determination to put it into non-performing loans and we have a large book that actually comes
due for servicing in that same timeframe.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Got it, and just one follow-up question – one more follow-up if I may. David, on the liability
side, could you remind us what the opportunity is in both the size and the rate of the TruPS that you could potentially
redeem and whether or not that rate is hedged out? Additionally, given that – our fixed income team, for example,
thinks you can issue five-year senior much more cheaply than where your long-term debt is costing you right now,
could you give us a sense of whether or not your trajectory for a stable margin includes some liability levers that you
could pull off on the wholesale side beyond the trust preferred?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Sure, I'll tell you our guidance does not include all the liability management initiatives
that we are considering at this point. Specifically, to the trust preferreds, we do have two issues. One's a $500 million
issue that is at 6 5/8ths and then there's the $345 million issue that's at 8 7/8ths and we continue to look at those as we
do our long-term debt and subordinated debt in the bank to evaluate all of the liability and capital management
strategies that are at our disposal.
So, we will continue to do that and all of that has not been factored into the guidance that I gave you.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matthew.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: One more NIM question here. The $1 billion premium that you have in the securities
book, obviously, that's a high number that you're amortizing a lot of that each quarter. Can you give us a sense of what
the amortization is and maybe what it was this quarter versus what it was last quarter or a year ago?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: We had amortization in the third quarter of approximately $75 million and that was up
from about $69.5 million in the second quarter.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. So you're obviously amortizing at a fairly high rate there. Just separately, the
service fees, I know they bounced nicely quarter to quarter but I think last quarter had some one-time adjustments and
you had been looking for the fees to bounce back a little bit more. Is that just lower NSF or overdraft usage or anything
else going on there?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: We do expect that run rate to get back to next quarter where we are – were we were in the
first quarter. We did have some adjustments in the third quarter, approximately $11 million that we believe will not
recur in the fourth quarter and so you can think of it, Matt, in terms of the run rate being more consistent with the first
quarter.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. Can you tell us what those adjustments were and maybe why they were not done
last quarter when you had some other adjustments?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: That $11 million was just adjusting the estimate of the reserve that we booked in the
second quarter. We got a better number in the third quarter and made the adjustment when we became aware of it.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi, good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a question about just the earning assets trajectory. So,
the next couple of quarters you've got $3 billion in CDs coming off and then $5 billion in the first quarter. So, a
significant amount of the balance sheet that's got the opportunity to reprice very near term. Can you tell us about just
how you're planning on either retaining the CDs or should we continue to expect the overall size of the earning asset
base to continue to shrink as it has the last couple of quarters as you've been doing this positive remixing on the deposit
side?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I mean, Ken, we've been executing a pretty aggressive deposit repricing strategy for
a number of quarters now. We continue to be confident in that strategy. The results are apparent in our numbers. We
still believe there's opportunity to continue to price down our overall deposit cost but more importantly, we continue to
be pleased with the mix shift that we're seeing. Time deposits are now down to 16% of our total deposit portfolio, and
we do believe we've still got opportunity to continue to drive down that total cost of that book of business.
We've been seeing retention of the time deposits that matures sort of in about the 70% range. We haven't seen that
change over time. It stayed fairly consistent through this strategy and we would anticipate it continuing. That being
said, a lot of those dollars that leave the time deposit category appear to be landing in other products to some degree
with inside the bank. And so, while we've reduced our reliance on time deposits considerably, our overall deposits have
only compressed moderately and so – and we continue as we said earlier to have a very healthy loan to deposit ratio
this quarter of 79%.

So, at this juncture, we plan on continuing to execute this same deposit strategy and incrementally improve that deposit
funding over time. On the earning asset side, we continue to have more of our earning assets in securities than we'd
prefer. We're looking for opportunities to lend. We're finding traction in certain areas. As David mentioned, our
pipelines look strong. On the commercial side of our house, the third quarter's always a seasonally low quarter for that
activity, but our pipelines are probably about as strong as we've seen them in a long time.
That being said, like you've heard on a number of these earning conference calls, customers seem a little hesitant the
last month or so to borrow or to invest but we anticipate, like we normally see, a pretty strong surge in the fourth
quarter and we anticipate that, but we are monitoring sort of the conviction and confidence of our customers as we
move forward.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay, Grayson, thanks, and to then follow up just on the securities portfolio side to your point
about the portfolio being bigger than you would like. It's continued to grow as an offset to the shrinking loan portfolio.
So, maybe, David, can you talk us through kind of what's rolling off the book and what you're finding, what you're
investing in incrementally as the securities portfolio has continued to grow to kind of fill this gap?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah. We have just normal cash flow coming off of the portfolio, $500 million a month I
think I've mentioned that before that we have to put back to work. Some of that's gone into mortgage-backeds but the
rates on those are so low we're looking for alternatives. Those alternatives include new issue CMBS as well as
corporate securities. You can see where we are today in our portfolio being about $2.5 billion in those two. That will
grow and that will be a place where we put some of our cash flow that we have.
We obviously – our preference is to deploy that in the loan books but we want to make sure that we're growing the
loans prudently and being paid for the risk we take. We're encouraged by our pipelines on the loan side. We're
encouraged by the conversion that we finished with credit card. There a lot of positives that we have that are adding to
help us offset this low growth, low demand environment that we have for loans but we also will look to liability
management as we discussed earlier and find the most prudent use of our cash flow.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Great and one just quick one for you, David, on the expense side. You mentioned in the press
release, there's a whole bunch of line items that had – that looked like they were just above trend, whether it was that
long-term incentive comp and a couple of the card conversion, et cetera. Can you give us a kind of directional help in
terms of how many of those things or can you quantify the things that were either one time or above trend this quarter
in terms of what expenses should look like next quarter?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: I can on the conversion. The conversion cost us roughly in that line item you're referring
to in the $8 million range that shouldn't be there. The long-term incentive is the amortization of the grant that was made
in the second quarter, so that amortization obviously is there through the award period. But that's the answer on that
conversion piece.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. Got it, guys. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. David, the question is for you. You mentioned
a couple of times the opportunities that you're seeing to deploy cash flow out of the portfolio into new issue CMBS and
corporate securities.
Just curious as to where you're thinking those yields can be put on for your portfolio relative to the MBS opportunities
that you're seeing?

Page 12 of 17
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, I think if you're looking at MBS today, you're looking at a 1.25% range, we think,
in the – when we're talking about corporates, we're talking about the AAA trust, so pretty safe tranche that's somewhere
in the 1.5% to 2.5% range.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then a question on HARP if I can. You mentioned that about half of your
year-to-date originations in the HARP program have come from outside your own portfolio. Could you provide a little
color as to where those mortgages were sitting previous to your refinancing them?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I'll give you a little bit of color. As we mentioned, we did about $2.2 billion in total
mortgage production last quarter, this quarter. 21% of that would have been HARP II production and down just a little
bit from last quarter. Last quarter would have been about 22%. So, we're only down about 1% from where we're at.
What we're finding is that production – that production is really coming to us, both our customers and someone who
had their original mortgage with someone else and 50% of those today have been from another competitor.
I think if you look at the market share data for mortgages without calling names, most of the mortgages are held by a
handful of institutions in this country, much larger institutions, and that's where the vast majority of it is coming from.
All of our mortgage office, mortgage bankers are out in our local markets and, obviously, most of our production is
coming from those states that we have the most dominant share in, which is Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Arkansas. So, that's where the bulk of majority of our production will come through, but the mortgage
business is a very concentrated business in this country and the vast majority of the mortgages are held by four or five
players.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: And then if I can, a final question for you, David. I know you mentioned that you're
considering issuing preferred stock. Is that something you would think about filling the entire 150 basis points of Tier 1
qualifying preferred basically all at once and if I estimate that, that would be around $1.4 billion of preferred stock
based on your Tier 1 risk-weighted assets of $91 billion?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, I want to be careful about mentioning any particular size based on our release
earlier, but suffice it to say, you can see what our Tier 1, non-common Tier 1 is made up today, are trust preferred
securities. I think it would be prudent to have more non-common Tier 1 instruments in there at an appropriate amount.
And so, preferred stock, obviously, can fill that. How that's done and how much and how many times is something that
we have to address in time and I don't want to talk specifically about how much we might have at any point in time.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio of Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: David, you mentioned on the preferred offering, I really don't know what you can say
about it, but that it could go to potentially redeeming trust preferred. Can I look at that as a dollar for dollar transaction
that the preferreds we raise may be dollar for dollar with the TruPS that we may redeem?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Again, I want to be careful how much I say. I think I pointed out that we have two issues,
the $500 million the 6-5/8ths – the $500 million at 6-5/8ths and the $345 million at 8-7/8ths. So, it's $845 million in
total and we have not and don't want to discuss what we would be doing with each or any of those issues that are
outstanding.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay. I was just trying to figure out if the potential benefit on the margin from the TruPS
redemptions – or possible TruPS redemption would be offset by the higher preferred dividend but I guess we'll have to
wait and see what type of preferred is offered. Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hey, Gerard, good morning.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Good morning, Can you guys give us a little more color on the $300 million to $400 million
of potentially new commercial real estate mortgages? I know you gave us some color, but are they primarily in Florida
or are they Georgia or are they hotel loans or investment-owned properties? Can you give us some background on
them?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: The $300 million to $400 million is what we are estimating that will migrate to the
non-performing status during the fourth quarter. That's our estimate of what we anticipate for the fourth quarter and the
mix of that migration, I think you could look at the mix that we're reporting today for the third quarter and we think that
that mix stays fairly consistent throughout and, again, with the large percentage of that being in the investor
commercial real estate space. Barb, would you like to add to that?
<A - Barbara Godin>: You're exactly right. What we're seeing is investor real estate is coming down generally each
quarter in terms of the migration as that book continues to shrink. So, the C&I book is staying relatively flat. We're
seeing the consumer book staying relatively flat. Again, that's why we feel good about positioning that – our potential
problem loans for the quarter will be between $300 and $400 million next quarter.
The other comment I would make on the second quarter as well, go back one quarter and look at the $315 million that
did come in. I think we mentioned on that last investor call, everything that could have gone right during the quarter
went right during the quarter, so everything we had hoped would move in the right direction did and what we saw in
the third quarter I would say is more of a normalized quarter where certain things didn't happen in the third quarter but
will happen now in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Some of the banks, the OCC regulated banks have had to set aside higher non-performing
assets and charge-offs for these Chapter 7 loans that they're referring to. I know you guys obviously didn't have to do
that but do you have an estimate that if the non-OCC banks are required to do this, what your number might be in terms
of increase in non-performing assets and net charge-offs due to this change by the regulators?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Gerard, we're currently looking at that right now, sizing it up. At this point, we don't see it as
being a material number for us. Remember, again, that we have a very active consumer assistance program and that
program has been in place for a while and what we have done on that program is when a customer goes through that
program, we typically charge the loan down to value at that time and put the loan on non-accrual and PDR if necessary.
So, again, we will be coming out in the fourth quarter with any numbers associated with the change to the guidance but
at this point, as I said, we don't see it as being a material number.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay, and then finally, your capital is obviously quite strong, especially under the Basel III
NPR methodology that may be the final methodology. Last year, of course, in CCAR, you came out and repaid TARP.
Should we expect that you would decline to return some capital to shareholders whether in the form of an increased
dividend or a buyback in this year's CCAR?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I think if you look at Basel III and where our numbers are at, those estimates are
based on the composition of our balance sheet today without us taking any actions in terms of business models and
products that we offer. So, I think that Basel III number obviously over time will be different as we change our
business model in reaction to Basel III depending on how that is finalized but I think as you look at our capital position,
we continue to strengthen our capital position every quarter.

We'll be submitting the 2013 CCAR stress test, if you will, here in not too many months away and we have any number
of items under consideration. I think it would be premature on this call to disclose our thoughts on that but clearly we're

position that we are going to be very thoughtful in that regard.

Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Good morning. I wanted to circle back and, David, just get a little more precision around
the credit card expenses and the unusual one-time impact of this quarter and how quick that could maybe run off. I
want to make sure we're including both the marketing as well as the conversion cost. If you look at the marketing
number, it's up about $7 million this quarter. Outside services is up about $5 million, maybe there's some – you were
mentioning $8 million of conversion costs. Can you put all that together and then how quickly does that – whatever the
number is run down in the future?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, Marty, I think if you – that was a message I was trying to send. Take the $8 million
out of the run rate in terms of being a one-timer and I think you're going to get pretty close to what the run rate – the
remainder is on the run rate there.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And that will roll off in the next quarter?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes, that's correct. It won't be there in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay and then I was just curious as we talked earlier this year about the debt rating and
going back to investment grade and how that was going to begin to help you attract some of your traditional customers
back in on the deposit side. Have you begun to see some of that benefit and is that what is spilling over even into the
C&I loan growth that you're beginning to see now?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Clearly, Marty, we've seen benefit as our credit ratings have improved in particular on the
commercial side of our business on both loans and deposits and quite frankly on overall relationship and ability to
attract and retain those relationships. And so, overall, it's been a net positive. How you quantify that is somewhat
elusive but, anecdotally, I think it's been a very positive story.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then, David, one last question. If you look at the loan yield compression, it kind of
seems like you went from first quarter to second quarter, you got some of those payoffs in prepayments that help keep
the yield on loans higher. So, if you kind of smooth between the first to the third quarter and then kind of look at where
it started to decline back in the fourth quarter, your loan yields are going down 5 basis points to 6 basis points per
quarter. And then on the flip side if you look at your deposit costs, they've been going down probably 4 basis points to
5 basis points per quarter.
So, in a sense of kind of holding margin flat going forward, if you bring in some of the other kind of funding costs and
programs that you're talking about, you're almost matching deposit costs and loan yield compression on a quarterly
basis, except for just on anomaly that occurred last quarter?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, I think if you look at last quarter we had mentioned we had on the loan side about
five points in our loan yields that were due to the interest reversals that we spoke about earlier. So if you take our – take
our about 3.29% in that quarter and reduce that five points, you're at – I'm sorry, 4.29% and reduce that five points to
4.24%, you can kind of see that now a little smoother to the 4.18% that we have today. The mix of our loan portfolio is
a big driver. We're encouraged again by our pipelines that we see. We're encouraged by – while pricing is under
pressure, we still see favorable spread out there that we can get.

Our credit rating is helping us to get into places that we hadn't before helps, looking at things like credit card, which
obviously give you a better yield and having that conversion done, we expect opportunities to grow there. So, there is
going to be continued pressure on loan yields but we think we can offset those with the improvement in deposit costs.
You can run the numbers based on the $3 billion of deposits that are maturing in the fourth quarter at 2.1% is pretty
significant buffer to the headwind that we're facing on the low rate environment.

Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Jenny Haskew Demba>: Good morning. You mentioned in your monologue that there is some pricing
competition increase, particularly on the middle market side. Just wondering if you could give color on what you're
seeing in commercial loan pricing right now up and down the spectrum?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, we've got – we're using quite a bit of analytics on pricing. I would tell you that in the
upper end of the middle market space, large commercial space, we've seen obviously increased competition and you've
probably seen pricing moderate over the last few quarters but it's been fairly stable. I think that it's down a little bit
from the peak of a few quarters ago, but certainly at or above historical trends on commercial and industrial lending. In
investor commercial real estate space, spreads there are still much higher than historical averages. And so while there is
a lot of competition and there is pricing pressure, we still see pricing holding up fairly well.
As you get down into the business and community banking, the smaller credits, there's more pricing competition there.
There's a few different players in that market and we are seeing that part of the segment come under a little more
pressure and pricing has moderated lower – trended lower in the last couple of quarters in that particular part of the
segment. Not a lot of demand in that segment and so, a lot of competitors and few borrowers. So you're seeing a little
more pressure there.
<Q - Jenny Haskew Demba>: Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from Greg Ketron of UBS.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Good morning. You had mentioned I think on prior calls and prior guidance or outlooks
that longer term, normalized loan loss reserves maybe kind of settling in a 1.50% to 2% range and net charge-offs
maybe somewhere around 75 basis points and looking at the last couple of quarters, if you project out the loan loss
reserve levels, you could be approaching that kind of 1.75% to 2% range maybe the middle of next year, realizing that
the reserve releases will slow down.
And if that, one, I guess the first question would be in terms of the longer term view of the reserve and the charge-offs,
is that still intact? And then the second part would be if that's the case, there's obviously some earnings that will need to
be replaced and maybe what are the things that you're looking at at Regions in terms of the business strategy to try to
fill that void that may be created by the provision expense going up?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah, Greg, this is David. We do believe based on what we know today and, obviously,
there's some accounting rules that are being proposed on allowance but let's use today's rules, we still believe that 1.5%

to 2% is a reasonable range and I know that's kind of wide but that's the best we can do at this juncture. We know
where our charge-offs have been elevated, we said they would be elevated, but we have those reserve for.
If you think about the 75 basis points of charge-offs, that's a through-the-cycle charge-off rate. That means you would
expect that there are some periods of time where that's lower and if you look at the type of credit that's going on the
books today for us, it's pretty clean. It's pretty good, which is why our provision is where it is. The provision is taking
care of the new stuff that we have or any diminution in the credit quality of what's on the books and we're seeing that
stabilize over the last several quarters which is why we can provide where we are. The charge-offs are separate and,
again, we already had those reserved for and as they come through, we'll take care of them.
So, what you need to look at in terms of estimating provision is look at our credit quality, whether it be in terms of
criticized and classified. I mentioned that in my prepared comments as being one of the best and first places one could
look as to how your credit quality is trending and criticized and classifieds continue to come down for us which tells us
what – informs us as to what our future provisioning and future reserves will be. So, don't put the 75 basis points in as
the low water mark. That's a through-the-cycle number.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Okay. Very helpful. So, really as you look out and think about how things may evolve and
I know it's early but think about charge-offs being potentially below that 75 basis point level longer term?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: At some point, you would expect that to be the case to be able to articulate a 75 basis
points through-the-cycle, that means they have to be below that at some point.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Okay. Great, thank you. Appreciate the color.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Okay.

Your next question comes from Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Research.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Gaston.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Hello, good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Okay, thanks. Sorry about that. Yeah, I just had a quick follow-up on that last question a
couple of minutes ago on the commercial loan space question. Indeed it seems like you guys and other banks have been
seeing some nice growth in C&I. Again, following up on that last question, does it feel like as things stand now in the
competitive space, are the other banks in the space, do you think are they – as they chase the segment, are they – are we
at a stage where they're compromising loan quality for market share or would you say the competition is still pretty
rational, if you will?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I would say that from our perspective we see the competition as being very rational, not
that you don't get the anecdotal comment from time to time but I would say that our general perspective is the
competition is rational, but everybody's out looking for business and so we run into competition in both customers and
prospect's offices and we all are after the business but the – and competing for it but we're not seeing – we aren't seeing
a big change in underwriting structure. You are seeing competitive pricing. Clearly, pricing is part of the underwrite
and – but at this point in time, we just aren't seeing a lot of anomalies in that regard.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Great, thank you very much.
