MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Campbell Soup Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.
At in time, all participants in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions
will follow at this time. [Operator Instructions]
I would like now to turn the conference over to your host, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please
begin.
Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, Mary. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Campbell Soup Company's fourth quarter earnings

With me here in New Jersey today are Doug Conant, our President and CEO; Craig Owens, Senior Vice President and
CFO, as well as Chief Administrative Officer; and Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance. Doug and
Craig each will provide you their perspectives on our performance for the quarter and fiscal year, as well as our
expectations for fiscal 2011. Following their remarks, we'll take questions from analysts and investors.
As usual, we've created slides to accompany our presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning

As a reminder, our presentation today includes certain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current
expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions
and estimates, which could be inaccurate and which inherently are subject to risks and uncertainties, all of which are
listed in our slides. You can refer to that slide or to our most recent 10-K and other 8-K filings for a list of the factors
that can cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated or expressed in any forward-looking
statements that we make on our call.
Consistent with our previous disclosures, the results presented today all have been adjusted for items impacting
comparability. There were no additional items impacting comparability of our results in the fourth quarter of 2010.
They're all in prior periods. We will present organic sales results today which do exclude the impacts of currency and
M&A activity, as we believe this is a better indicator of our ongoing business performance. We will also present
segment operating earnings adjusted for the items impacting comparability.
Since our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures as defined by the SEC rules, we've provided a
reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides
accompanying the presentation. These slides, including the appendix, can be found on our website as well.
And with that, I give you our President and CEO, Doug Conant.
Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jennifer. And good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you on the phone and the webcast for joining our
fiscal 2010 earnings conference call. I'd like to share a few comments on our performance in the fourth quarter and the
fiscal year and our plans for fiscal 2011. Then I will turn the call over to Craig for a more detailed discussion.
Our net earnings per share increased 10% for the fourth quarter to $0.33, including a favorable tax rate and the impact
of our share repurchase program. Our healthy beverages business led the way, posting significant sales growth in the
fourth quarter. Our quarter's results brought us to an increase in net earnings per share for the fiscal year of 12%. In a
challenging environment, we delivered strong earnings growth, overcoming softer-than-expected sales, to finish
slightly above the high end of our earnings range and well above our long-term target.
I'm pleased with how well we managed our margins this year. I'm also pleased with our cash flow performance,
including more than $1 billion in cash flow from operations this year, despite an extraordinarily high contribution to
our pension fund. We delivered those results while continuing to invest for long-term growth, including spending on
our IT infrastructure, wellness and nutrition innovation, and our work in emerging markets.
In a year when sales growth was difficult for the entire food industry, and short of our own expectations, we benefited
from a great deal of hard work on cost and expense initiatives across the organization. Improved productivity, favorable
currency, and our share repurchase program all contributed to our EPS growth this year.
That having been said, we recognize that growing the top line is the key challenge for us and for the food industry as a
whole in order to deliver quality earnings growth in a sustainable way. As we enter our fiscal year 2011, I am confident
that we have the programs and plans in place to address this challenge.
Leaning into our businesses in healthy beverages and baked snacks, we will offer a full slate of innovation, including
V8 V-Fusion + Tea; upgrades to the company's largest baked snacks brand, Goldfish, which is the largest children's
snack cracker in the world; and Arnott's Shapes; new varieties and a relaunch of chunk cookies for Pepperidge Farm;
and line extensions for Arnott's Vita-Weat, just to name a few of our renovation efforts.
Our healthy beverages and baked snacks brands will also be supported by stepped-up marketing. In this regard, we'll be
leveraging advertising campaigns that have already shown positive results, such as our Numbers campaign on V8
healthy beverages. We're funding the increased marketing with our expense reduction initiatives, such as our improved
indirect procurement effort. In addition, we will significantly strengthen our competitiveness in simple meals.

The primary initiative in our soup business this year is to fire up condensed soup. This initiative will benefit both
cooking soups, which are part of our broader meal-makers portfolio, and our eating soups. We will also improve the
competitiveness of our ready-to-serve soups through more consistent promotional activity commencing this fall.
Both condensed and ready-to-serve soups will benefit from our new umbrella advertising campaign, which starts next
week. This campaign will celebrate the amazing qualities of Campbell's soup in a category-building fashion. We also
have competitive marketing support planned for our international soup businesses, including a major relaunch of our
Erasco Heisse Tasse soup in Germany later this month. And we will launch a concentrated broth for value consumers in
several markets around the world.
Based on the year we just concluded and our plans for next year, we provided earning guidance for fiscal 2011 today.
Specifically, we expect net sales growth of 2 to 3%, EBIT growth of 4 to 5%, and EPS growth of 5 to 7%. Craig will
provide further details about our assumptions in just a moment.
As I step back and look at the broader landscape, I see that consumers remain very value conscious, and the
competition in our industry will remain intense. Our customers likewise have their challenges. Growing the top line
will remain difficult. And it will have to come largely from volume growth, not from pricing.
As we look ahead, we're committed to driving sustainable, profitable growth, and our outlook for the coming year is
consistent with that expectation. In the near term, we will drive growth the same way successful food companies
always have: through focus, product quality, innovation, strong marketing, and competitive pricing. Over the long term,
we will leverage all of the assets at our disposal, including our leading brands in our core categories, regional scale,
world-class product technologies, financial strength, and organization excellence. In my opinion, we're extremely well
positioned and well equipped to compete, to perform, and to win, particularly in our categories of focus.
With that, I will turn the call over to Craig for a more detailed discussion of the quarter's and the year's performance.
Craig?
B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Administrative Officer
Thanks, Doug. I'll spend a few moments walking you through the fourth quarter results and segment highlights,
followed by comments on our fiscal year-to-date results. Then I'll provide color around our fiscal year results by
segment, including the U.S. soup performance, and I'll conclude by addressing our F '11 earnings guidance.
For the quarter, we reported net sales of $1.518 billion, down 1% versus the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the
favorable impact of currency translation, organic net sales decreased by 2% due to increased promotional spending.
EBIT of $187 million for the quarter is down 6% versus a year ago, primarily due to increased promotional spending
and cost inflation, partially offset by productivity improvements and lower administrative expense. Despite the EBIT
decline, earnings per share of $0.33 rose 10% versus the prior year.
In the fourth quarter, I reported net sales declined 1%, which reflected increased promotional spending of 2 points,
partially offset by a 1 point increase due to currency translation. To improve our price competitiveness, primarily in
North America, we increased our trade spending levels across several of our key businesses. Reflecting this increased
promotional spending, organic net sales decreased by 2%.
In the fourth quarter, our gross margin percentage decreased from 40.6% in fiscal 2009 to 40.4% in the current quarter,
a decrease of 20 basis points. This decrease was primarily due to increased promotional spending and cost inflation, net
of significant productivity improvements. Higher advertising expense this quarter increased our marketing and selling
expenses by 6% from $209 million in 2009 to 221 million in 2010. Administrative expenses declined $17 million due
to lower incentive compensation cost.
As I mentioned earlier, EBIT declined 6% in the fourth quarter. Net interest expense increased 13% in the quarter, as
the cost of increasing the proportion of long-term debt was partly offset by the reduction in short-term rates.

The tax rate declined significantly in the fourth quarter by 9.1 points to 29.8%. The decrease in rate is primarily due to
reduced taxes from a lower level of foreign dividends compared to a year ago. As a result of the lower tax rate, net
earnings increased by 6% for the quarter.
We continue to execute our strategic share repurchase program, leveraging our strong cash flow. As a result, diluted
shares outstanding declined by 2% for the quarter, contributing to earnings per share growth of 10%.
Next I'd like to comment on our segment results for the quarter. In the U.S. Soup, Sauces, and Beverages segment,
sales decreased 1%, primarily due to a decline in U.S. soup, partly offset by growth in beverages. Beverage sales
increased 12%, driven by significant growth in V8 V-Fusion juice, V8 vegetable juice, and V8 Splash juice drinks.
Operating earnings decreased 6% to $139 million this quarter, from 148 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease
was primarily due to an increased promotional spending, partly offset by productivity gains.
U.S. soup sales for the quarter decreased 5%, with sales of both condensed and ready-to-serve soups declining 7% due
to volume decline and increased promotional spending; broth sales increased 9%.
In Baking and Snacking, organic sales were unchanged for the quarter as gains in the Indonesian biscuit business were
offset by a decline in Pepperidge Farm. Sales in Arnott's were comparable to a year ago, as higher volumes were offset
by increased promotional spending. The favorable impact of currency drove a 6% improvement in operating earnings.
Organic sales for the International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment declined 4%, primarily due to declines in
Europe and Canada, partly offset by gains in the Asia-Pacific region. Operating earnings decreased from $19 million to
6 million, due to declines in Europe and Canada, again partly offset by margin-driven earnings growth in Asia-Pacific.
Reflecting continued weakness in the foodservice sector, organic sales declined 9% in our North America Foodservice
segment. Earnings increased $3 million in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting our
cost-reduction efforts.
Turning now to the full-year fiscal results, reported net sales increased 1%, with organic net sales down 2%, primarily
due to declines in the U.S. Soup, Sauce and Beverage segment. EBIT of $1.360 billion is up 7% versus a year ago,
primarily due to improved gross margin and favorable currency, partly offset by lower sales. We achieved earnings per
share of $2.47 this fiscal year, an increase of 12% versus the prior year. This EPS growth reflects the increase in
operating earnings, the benefits of using our positive cash flow to fund our share repurchase program, and a slightly
lower tax rate.
Our reported net sales grew 1%. We had a 1-point decline from volume and mix and a 2-point negative impact due to
higher promotional spending. Increases in promotional spending more than offset small price increases in the highly
competitive environment, with value at the top of consumers' minds. Organic sales decreased 2% as declines in U.S.
soup, primarily ready-to-serve, and North America Foodservice were partly offset by strong gains in U.S. beverages.
Currency translation, primarily the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, contributed 3 points of sales growth to the
full year.
Our gross margin percentage increased from 40.2% to 41%. This 80 basis point improvement was primarily due to
productivity improvements in excess of cost inflation.
Marketing and selling expenses for the year decreased from $1.077 billion to 1.058 billion, primarily due to lower
advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by the impact of currency. In several businesses, we reduced
advertising expenditures and shifted those resources to fund promotional activities in order to maintain price
competitiveness. While advertising costs are down from a year ago, advertising impressions in the U.S. as measured by
gross rating points increased as we took advantage of lower media rates. Our total marketing support, which includes
promotional spending, is up for the year.
Administrative expenses increased by 2% from $591 million in 2009 to 605 million. The increase was primarily due to
the impact of currency and higher compensation and benefit cost, including pension expense, partly offset by the
benefit of the company's cost reduction efforts.

Below the operating line, net interest expense was unchanged for the fiscal year. The tax rate was 31.3%, 70 basis
points lower than the year-ago rate, reflecting a lower level of foreign dividends. For the full year, net earnings
increased by 9%. Diluted shares outstanding declined 3% for the year, resulting in earnings per share growth of 12%.
Now I'll comment on the segment results for the full year. In the U.S. Soup, Sauces, and Beverages segment, sales
decreased 2%, reflecting a decline in U.S. soup, partly offset by gains in beverages. Beverage sales increased 4%,
driven by double-digit volume gains in the second half of the year. V8 V-Fusion sales increased double-digits due to
increased advertising and successful new item launches, including cranberry-blackberry and acai light varieties and
new 8-ounce slim can package. Sales of V8 Splash juice drinks increased, while sales of V8 vegetable juice declined
for the full year. Prego pasta sauce sales grew, reflecting the continuing success of our Heart Smart varieties, and sales
of Pace Mexican sauce declined.
Operating earnings increased 2% for the segment to $943 million from 927 million a year ago. This increase was
primarily due to productivity-driven gross margin gains and lower advertising spend, more than offsetting the impact of
lower sales.
For the full year, U.S. soup sales decreased 4%. Despite the increase in sales of condensed cooking varieties driven by
increased home eating occasions, sales of Campbell's condensed soups in total decreased 2%. Sales of ready-to-serve
soup declined 9%, reflecting negative category trends in both canned and microwaveable varieties. Broth sales
increased 3%, also benefiting from the growth of in-home meal preparation and from consumer demand for our 100%
natural product offerings.
The following chart is a look at category performance in the U.S. during fiscal year 2010, based on IRI panel data and
Campbell internal estimates. Continuing high unemployment and a corresponding low level of consumer confidence
have resulted in declines in consuming spending. These trends have impacted the food industry as a whole. Consumers
are making fewer store trips; they're shopping more closely to their list and reducing stock-up purchases and trading
down to lower-cost alternatives. Broadly speaking, our data indicate that consumers are purchasing fewer items and
spending even fewer dollars on grocery. In fact, food volumes in the grocery channel declined throughout our last
quarter, and dollar spending has a longer negative trend.
For the soup category, these dynamics have had a negative impact, particularly on our ready-to-serve cans and
microwavable products, which carry higher average selling prices. The overall category has declined by 4.7%. Our
sales have declined 5.2%. We've outperformed all other branded players by 2 percentage points. While we've been
impacted by the ready-to-serve category trends, our meal-maker businesses, condensed cooking soups and broths, have
had much better performance due to their strong value and the trend toward consumers eating more at home.
As you can see in the following chart, private label share in soups still trails that of other mature food categories, sitting
at only 12%. Campbell's dollar share in wet soup was 63.6%, reflecting a modest 40 basis point decline in the past year,
driven by ready-to-serve soup. We gained dollar share in both condensed soup and broth, and we realized growth in
total volume share for the company for the fiscal year. All other branded players had a collective share of 24%.
For the full year in Baking and Snacking, organic sales were comparable to a year ago, as volume gains in both
Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's branded businesses were offset by increased promotional spending. In Pepperidge Farm,
we delivered strong sales gain from Goldfish Snack Crackers; however, cookies declined. Sales in our Australian
Arnott's business increased, driven by both Tim Tam's chocolate biscuits and Shapes savory crackers. The favorable
impact of currency and earnings growth in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's drove a 22% improvement in operating
earnings.
Organic sales in our International Soup, Sauces, and Beverages segment for the full year declined 1%. The decrease
was primarily driven by declines in Europe, reflecting lower sales in Germany and Canada due to lower sales volume
of ready-to-serve soup, partly offset by gains in the Asia-Pacific region.
The sales increases in Asia-Pacific were due to volume-driven gains in Japan, Australia, and Malaysia. Despite the
lower organic sales, operating earnings increased by 18%, primarily driven by the favorable impact of currency.

Excluding the impact of currency, margin-driven earnings growth in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region was mostly
offset by the decline in Canada.
Consistent with the quarter, North American Foodservice was impacted by the weak economy for the full year, with
organic sales down 5%. Earnings increased $2 million from 53 million in the prior year to 55 this fiscal year as we
aggressively managed the cost of this business to protect profitability.
Cash flow from operations of $1.057 billion compared to $1.166 billion in the prior year. The current-year cash flow
includes a $260 million contribution to Campbell's U.S. pension plan, the impact of which was mostly offset by
improved working capital performance and higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures decreased from 345 million to
$315 million. The capital expenditures for this year included the expansion of our world headquarters, capacity
increases for both Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm, and the ongoing implementation of SAP in Australia and New
Zealand. Looking ahead, we expect capital expenditures in 2011 to be approximately $300 million for the fiscal year.
In fiscal 2010, we repurchased 14 million shares at a total cost of $472 million under our strategic share repurchase
program authorized in June 2008 and under the company's ongoing practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset
those issued under incentive compensation plans. Net debt ended the year at $2.526 billion, a decrease of $47 million.
We anticipate a continuation of the challenging economic environment, with high unemployment, low consumer
performance, and value-focused consumer shopping behavior. Reflecting this outlook, we expect growth in net sales of
2 to 3%, primarily volume driven, for the full fiscal year 2011. We expect growth in adjusted EBIT of 4 to 5% which
reflects an increase of 40% or $17 million in our U.S. pension expense and a forecasted inflation in cost of sales of 2 to
3%. Our projected 2011 growth rates in sales and EBIT are 1% below our long-term targets. We expect adjusted
earnings per share growth of 5 to 7%, consistent with our long-term growth target.
With that, we'll take your questions. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Hi, good morning, everybody. Happy holidays to you over the weekend.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Eric.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: I guess – obviously it's a tough environment and, Doug, you've kind of noted – you've told us
that, and the data indicates it – and thank you also for providing the market share data and the category trends. I think
that's helpful. But I guess what I wanted to understand was the – Craig, you went into a little bit with the marketing
spending, how that was kind of down for the year, and you were forced to kind of shift from advertising to promotion.
But as the year progressed, did you just feel that the portfolio, particularly in soup, wasn't, I guess, positioned with the
consumer and that that's why you really didn't aggressively try to push advertising and get the consumer to really stay
interested in the category? I mean, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the dynamics of that decision versus the

consumer as the year progressed and kind of how that affects your view into 2011.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Eric, let me try that on. Basically, what we
learned in the first half of the year – relearned; we've known it before – that there are two moments of truth. The first
moment of truth is when they're in store making purchasing decisions, and the second moment of truth is when they
actually prepare and consume the product.
What we learned in first half was that we needed to be sufficiently competitive and hit the right price points and
manage price gaps smartly, relative to other competitors in soup and more broadly in simple meals. And so over the
course of the year, we focused on making sure we were competitive in that first moment of truth.
At the same time, we did maintain overall for the year a competitive level of advertising and actually improved our
GRPs versus the target. So we felt we had the right balance. It was a tough year. Quite frankly, we never were able to
fully overcome the second quarter shortfall. Came back with a solid third quarter. And as we got into the fourth quarter,
we found our customers really wanted to focus their inventory build into the – late in the summer in order to minimize
their working capital before we started our advertising and promotion, which really kicks off in a big way, actually, on
September 6.
So that's how we managed the year. I'm very bullish about our ability to perform in this coming year. We understand
the pricing environment we're in now; we are organized to compete at that level going into the season, not trying to
adjust in midseason. We are very well aligned with the customers now; the customers are more prepared to deal with
the environment we're operating in. So I'm very bullish about our ability to perform and – starting in the first quarter.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: And just as a follow-up, and then I'll pass it on, is that why it seemed as if your comments visà-
vis the product format was that you're, it sounds like a little bit more focused on the condensed side where your only
competition is private label as opposed to ready-to-serve and that the – your sense as to the consumer and what the
retail customers want is a – let's say a greater focus on that value delivery?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. The consumer is looking for the value, and
our condensed soup offering is the most appealing to consumers right now, both for cooking at home and for
consuming with their eating soups. So we do have a major – as you know, we have a major relaunch of our condensed
soup line, we call it Firing Up Condensed, where we have product improvements, marketing improvements, shelving
improvements, and all of that activity is coming together starting in the first two weeks of September. So that is our
primary focus this year.
But at the same time, we're going to be very competitive with other simple meal alternatives for ready-to-serve soup
going into the season, and we expect that one-two punch to have impact. We'll also have, in my experience, the first
fully integrated campaign supporting the entire Campbell's soup portfolio that we've ever had at very high levels. So
you'll start to see that beginning September 6 as well.
I guess one last point on soup that Craig mentioned but we sort of glossed over is we had the best volume performance
of anyone in the soup category this year, and that includes private label. So while the category was down, we know
what it takes to get the volume on track, and we're in the process of doing that this year. So while we may have
difficulty in terms of getting any price realization this year, we do expect to have good volume performance. And I
think that's going to allow us to deliver very solid results.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: And our next question, please.

<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Doug, let me pick up on that comment around volume heading into the new fiscal year. One of
the things that struck me looking at the fiscal third quarter through the fiscal fourth – and obviously they're very
different quarters, right, in terms of how they're made up and the seasonality and all, and the comparisons – but in the
fiscal third quarter, the additional promotion really seemed to drive quite a bit of the incremental volume that we saw in
that fiscal third quarter. In the fourth, it seems like that relationship was a lot less clear, that the incremental promotion
didn't necessarily drive sort of the volume. And given that's such a big part of, I know, what you're doing going into
next year, I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Maybe there's some things – differences between the two quarters
that would be helpful for me to get a better understanding of.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I'll -
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: And then we'll go from – I just had a follow-up after that.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Andrew, you're right. The fourth quarter is
very different than the third quarter; it's only 15% of our year. And what we found was customers were more focused
on preparing for the next soup season as opposed to aggressively promoting and building the business in the fourth
quarter. So I would say all of the focus began to shift towards building inventories for the first quarter, and I expect
you're going to see that turn around in the first quarter.
So I think it was more of a customer, and quite frankly a Campbell's company, focus gearing up for the first quarter and
making sure that we had all of – particularly our condensed soups and our old labels cleaned up and moved out and
began shipping in our new labels more fully to all distribution beginning in August for our September relaunch. So I
think there is more of a timing issue related to this fiscal year than there was a consumer issue in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: That's helpful for that -
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It's so small, any move makes -
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Right.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: – can have a big difference on the percentages.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Yeah. As you think about 2011 then, as your kind of internal market research people and the
operating folks kind of build up their plans from the bottom up, how do you think about – looking at what the overall
category did in your last fiscal year to hit your sort of 2 to 3% sales growth target in the coming fiscal year? I guess I'm
curious, what assumptions are embedded in that in terms of what you think the soup category does this coming year, or
do you take it that level, or is it all about even if the soup category doesn't grow, we can take share because of what
you're going to be doing from an activity standpoint? I'm trying to get a sense of what you're building in into your
though process there, specifically around the core U.S. soup business?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: As you know, we don't provide guidance by
category. But I think it's safe to say we expect improved performance in our soup business in the U.S., and I certainly
believe that we can and should, lapping a difficult year after seven straight years of soup sales growth, to have one
hiccup here – I expect we'll be back on the growth track in soup. So even though we won't have an opportunity right
now, it doesn't look like, for price realization, we should have opportunity for volume growth. And I expect to – we'll
be back growing again. And we know how to compete with our – with actually both private label and other branded
competitors. We're certainly outperforming all other branded competitors on a dollar basis, and we even outperformed
private label on a volume basis this last year. So I think we're going to be able to perform very solidly.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thank you.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: I would
just add to that, that the guidance on the top line of 2 to 3% obviously is the whole portfolio. And as you know, we're
pretty optimistic about our beverage business as well as well as our Baking and Snacking businesses.

Our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Hi,
Alexia.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Hi, there. Just wanted to stick with the soup category a little more. We haven't talked about the
competition from simple meals much this time around. I was just curious about whether you saw the promotional
activity from other categories intensify this quarter, which may have served to choke off the soup category sales growth
even worse than might otherwise have been the case. And do you anticipate that kind of level of promotional activity in
those other simple meals categories to stay the same in fiscal '11, or do you see any sort of relief in sight?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Alexia, the fourth quarter is so small for us, a
small change creates a large percentage drop. And this was more focused on how we exited the year and worked with
our customers prepare for the next year.
In terms – so I personally have not observed that there's some significant impact from other simple meals in this
quarter. What I would say is we're anticipating that it'll be very competitive next year and – as competitive as it was this
past year – and we're very prepared for that.
Broadly, you would expect simple meals to do better against the soup category in the fourth quarter every year as a
Q3-to-Q4 movement. In fact, simple meals were soft along with the whole grocery trade in the quarter. Not as soft as
soup individually, but soft.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Great. Thank you very much, I'll pass it on.

<Q - Chris Growe>: Hi, guys. I just want to ask a question for you, Doug, in relation to promotion, and especially
looking at this past year and looking at some of the other food companies in general, we're not seeing a very good lift
around promotional spending as a general statement, and I think that'd be true for soup. I'm just curious why you think
the promotional levels stay high? And I inferred that from some of your comments, and maybe correct me if I'm wrong,
but looking at the coming year, it sounds like you're going to still be pretty aggressive on the promotional front. Is that
the right use of money? Because I know you're also doing some advertising spending. I guess I'm just curious on your
thoughts on that.

<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, importantly, we have – as we've done for
years – we've been building our marketing pressure on both the trade spending front and on the consumer spending
front. You're going to see competitiveness on both fronts across the portfolio, beyond just soup. But in this
conversation we'll just focus on soup. We expect to have a significant increase in our advertising consumer spending as
well. It's one of the benefits of having such a good cost management program. We've been able to build our gross
margins and our EBIT margins to a point where we can afford to continue to spend back against the business in a
sizable way.
So you're going to see strong support on both dimensions. We have to win at both moments of truth. We have to keep
at top of mind with the consumer, but we have to be competitive at the point of purchase. And we believe we can do
both those things. We do have an excellent cost management program that's helping to fund that work – and by the
way, we're also spending very competitively on healthy beverages and baked snacks, too, so that in all three of our
areas of focus, we've got very competitive business plans.
<Q - Chris Growe>: And would you regard the level of productivity savings then, the share or cost reduction efforts,
as any different from say fiscal '10 or maybe the average of the last several years? Is it really stepping up this coming
year? Because you've got some margin growth built in, and you've got a lot of spending built in, it sounds like.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I'll let Craig comment on it more fully, but
our cost savings effort this year, our productivity on total delivered cost effort, delivered excellent results this year. And
we have specific project streams that promise to deliver excellent results in this coming fiscal year.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Yeah,
we had our best year ever, or at least the best year in certainly many years in terms of cost savings this past year, in F
'10, more than – with end cost of sales significantly more than offsetting inflation and then beginning to see some good
results within our operating expenses, somewhat masked by big increases in pension. And we'll fight that same thing a
little bit as we come into F '11. But the short answer would be that we do expect a continued strong performance, both
at cost of sales and in operating expenses again in '11.
<Q - Chris Growe>: Could you quantify how much it helped maybe your gross margin in 2010? Or do you have that
handy?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: How
much the -
<Q - Chris Growe>: The productivity. I'm just curious what would it have helped your gross margin for the year.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Sure.
The enabler program in the full year contributed about 210 basis points to the gross margin improvement.
<Q - Chris Growe>: Okay, that's great. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Just a couple of follow-ups. First, on the net sales growth guidance of 2 to 3%, does that
include or exclude foreign exchange?

<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: The
assumption on foreign exchange is that it will be approximately neutral to the current year. So it's included at about flat.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Mid-way.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Right.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. And then, Craig, just anything we should think about in terms of the phasing during the
year? Because you've got some difficult currency comparisons in a few of the quarters, so I'm just – is it you're kind of
assuming that it's neutral for the whole year, or is there anything we should think about in terms of the seasonality of
that?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Yeah, I
think – I guess the best way to think about it would be – that the assumption would be that across the year we don't
expect to see much movement, so the comparisons – you're right, you probably need to pay a little bit of attention to
what was happening underneath it in '10, because that was a volatile year.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay, okay. And then on the cost inflation, 2 to 3%, is that net of productivity, or is that before
productivity?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: That's
before productivity – that's before the productivity programs.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: So if we're assuming incremental productivity, your cost inflation – net cost inflation – would
be below 2 to 3?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Yes, we
would expect to be able to offset that amount.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. And if I understood what you said to – in your response to Chris Growe's question, was
your net cost of goods inflation actually deflationary? Was it less than – was it negative?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: No, it
was not negative for F '10. It was slightly up.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. All right. And so we should be thinking about something similar for this year?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Well,
no, it'll be – sorry. Net of enabler savings for 2010, it would have been negative. All right?
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. And then net of -
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Net of
enabler savings for '11, again, we would expect to be able to neutralize it or better.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. And then in terms of that raw cost inflation number, how much of it is hedged? And if
you could talk about some of the moving parts there? I'm assuming that resins and packaging may be up, but produce is
down.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Yeah,
I'm not sure that's fair. Some of the bigger drivers within commodities would be wheat price is up. Across the produce
range, I think we would be up more than we were in the prior year probably. The tomato harvest, for example, is not
looking as good this year. Within energy, we've probably got some advantage versus prior year.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: So
natural gas costs, and that sort of thing.

<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. And so then just as we're thinking about a – forecasting a year that has little or no
pricing, is volume dependent with support from promotions, part of what protects the gross margin is that net of enabler
savings there really isn't going to be much inflation in your cost of goods sold. And given – I guess I'm trying to
understand just what could change that equation? How much of what you've got in terms of inflation is locked in? Or is
it pretty well locked in for the year?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: You
know, it varies by commodity, and it varies by our different businesses around the world. I mean, broadly speaking,
you should think about sort of the first half of the year being pretty stable and us having pretty good visibility to it. If
there were really significant moves between now and then, you'd see some of that flowing through in the second half of
the fiscal year.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And finally, just -

Our next question comes from David Palmer from UBS.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Hey,
David.
<Q - David Palmer>: Hi, guys.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, David.
<Q - David Palmer>: Now, Doug, I think this is – a lot of folks are really touching on this whole promotion spending
impact with consumer topic, and you certainly touched on the fact that fourth fiscal quarter is not the biggest-deal
quarter in the world, and certainly the customers – the retailer customers – are trying to right-size trade inventory
heading into the next soup season, which kind of muddied the interpretation of that quarter even more. But I'm just
trying to – and this really has to do with the packaged food industry in general. It feels like folks are trying to manage
how much they spend on any one visit, and it seems like the bulk deals, the sort of 10 for 10's of whatever category
we're talking about, are not working like they did in the past. And as you can see, people are really searching for a
strategy here that, in your thinking, about the responses on this at the consumer level going into the next year. Any
thoughts on that in general at the consumer level would be really helpful. Thanks.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure, David. There is a palpable change in
consumer buying behavior that's unlike anything we've experienced, certainly for a few decades. They are being more
surgical with their shopping. They are managing their pantries differently. They are kind of going to professional
shopping in the sense that Mom is not sending the teenagers out to go pick up the groceries now; she's looking at where
the best deal is and sort of surgically buying. Consumers by and large are not buying forward as much as they might
have been before in terms of pantry management. So what we're finding is we have to be more surgical as well in
response to consumer needs.
But there are certain points in time where there is an ebb and a flow to this. I suspect on – and when we get into the
back-to-school time, there will be more multiple purchases as people build pantries, maybe not to the extent they did
before, but they will be looking for volume opportunities. And there are other opportunities during the course of the
year where multiples will be attractive to people.

We have to manage this by store, by customer, by event. And so what you will see from us is a much more surgical
trade activation plan focused on meeting consumer needs by customer, by season, than we've had before. So you just
have to be – as the consumer is getting more surgical in their behavior, manufacturers and customers have to be more
surgical in how they create the offerings.

<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered. I guess
the maybe one thing left for me would just be, Doug, if I could ask you, you talked a little bit about inventory levels in
the fourth quarter and what the trade was looking to do going into next soup season. Broadly speaking, do you think
there's any risk to sort of another step-down in inventory levels at retail? I mean, you're talking about sort of continued
dramatic change in consumer purchasing behavior. To what extent does the retailer need to respond to that?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think we've got great visibility to inventories.
As you know, we do continuous replenishment for many of our customers, as well as help them manage their
categories. So we don't see any material change in inventory in the fourth quarter or going forward. We think we're at
pretty thin levels right now. We're pleased with the way we're managing our working capital, and I think our customers
are about where they need to be to be competitive. So I don't see any material change there.

<Q - Edward Aaron>: Doug, as you're probably aware, one of your peers made a comment this week about soup
weakness basically being kind of a global phenomenon right now. And he was obviously talking a lot about the specific
factors that contributed to the ready-to-serve category weakness in the last season in the U.S. But I just wanted to get
your response to the assertion that consumers are maybe behaving similarly in terms of soup category consumption just
around the world right now.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, actually, we don't see that. You just have to
think of soup on a more complete and holistic perspective and that includes at-home soup consumption. And what we
see in some markets around the world is people migrating to preparing more soup at home, but actually the number of
soup eatings growing as it has grown over the last four years. I think at our Analysts Day we talked about in the last
four years in the U.S., there've been a billion more servings than there were four years ago.

So we see soup consumption being very solid around the world. However, more of it is at home, and we have to
participate in that at-home occasion. But this is really the sweet spot for consumers. We just have to find a way to
participate with them. That's why our broth businesses by and large are up all around the world, where we help the
consumer prepare the soup. So I don't have that concern.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Okay. And if I could just sneak in one quick follow-up. It sounds like on the quarter there was
a bit of a timing shift in terms of shipments with retailers managing inventories down that should have – in turn have a
benefit in the first fiscal quarter. That seems like a percentage that you might be able to quantify for us, so I was hoping
you maybe can give us a number around that for how much you would pick up in Q1 in terms of just timing of
shipment change?

<Q - Diane Geissler>: Good morning.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Diane.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Hey, Doug, you and I had a conversation at your Analysts Day -
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: What did I say? Uh-oh.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Well, basically, we talked a little bit about the consumer and about the retailer, and I think your
comment to me was basically you didn't expect a big change in consumer behavior because the consumer is still
strapped. But what you thought you might see is that the retailer would manage the categories better, and maybe there
wouldn't be as much promotion sort of in some of the simple meal categories that you compete against. And I guess
we've had a change at the nation's largest retailer. And so has that dialogue changed at all? Is that still your -?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think my point in that conversation was that our
retail partners know how to compete, and they will respond. Retailers are – this is a mature industry, retailers find a
way to meet consumer needs. The meltdown threw, I think, the whole industry off its game a little bit. But our industry
is built to evolve, to compete, and to meet consumer needs. And I think the point I was trying to make in that
conversation is that I have a lot of confidence those retailers will figure it out. That they will – I mean, on balance, if
they need to promote more and get to certain price points to meet consumer needs, they'll do that. On balance, I think
they'll find a way to do that efficiently. It'll play out over the next year or two.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: But your expectations would be that it'd be maybe a little more rational this year than it was?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think -
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Maybe less reactionary, is the way to put it.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think we're all a little better prepared to deal
with what's in front of us than we were last year, but I think you have to plan for the worst and hope for the best here.
And so we're prepared for it to be very competitive.

<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Akshay.
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: I will ask about baked snacks. Though one question I had – I just wanted to put it into context.
Your sales growth guidance implies almost a 4.5% point year-over-year change in sales. So in light of what you just
said, can you talk about where that growth is going to come from, from a divisional standpoint? Maybe that's your
opportunity to talk about baked snacks. And then also, just – I wanted to get a better sense of your optimism going into
the soup season and your marketing plan. So if you could talk about just the magnitude of change in your marketing
spend and the difference in quality year over year, that would be very helpful.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: If I think in terms of our – we basically manage
three core – compete in three areas. Simple meals, baked snacks, and healthy beverages. The way we report that, it's not
as obvious. But I think you can clearly expect our baked snack performance to be above the average that we expect, as
well as our healthy beverage business. The way we report it is through our North Americas – in our soup – what is it –

Soup, Sauces, and Beverages. But our two core areas of healthy beverages and baked snacks will be above average, we
expect. And at this point, those are now at about 40% of our sales and earnings. So it's beginning to get material in
terms of our overall performance.
In terms of the quality of our marketing effort, I think the thing I would highlight as it relates to soup is, this will be the
first time in my experience that we have a fully integrated one umbrella line campaign that will have substantial weight
behind it across the full year for soup. And I believe the quality of this from all of our testing suggest s that this is going
to be our highest-quality marketing effort that we've had in the decade that I've been here. So I – the numbers are big,
but the quality of the work, I think, is the best we've done. It should start to materially impact our performance
beginning in the first quarter.
And by the way, the quality of our marketing in healthy beverages is exceptionally strong. In fact, I just saw the
creative for the new work this morning, and I expect another big year out V8 as well.
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: Great. I'll pass it along. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.
<Q -Robert Moskow>: Beginning to feel like the redheaded stepchild. Thanks for getting the call in here.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I have two redheads, so you're one of my
favorites.
<Q -Robert Moskow>: Yeah, so I guess my question was on marketing spending. I got a question from a client here I
thought was a good one, is that the marketing and selling line is about where it was – it's actually down $100 million
from where it was two years ago. And I know a lot of money has shifted above the line to trade support or trade promo,
but you know as well as anyone, Doug, that advertising dollars, when they go down, even if GRPs maybe are going up
a little bit, it never ends up being a formula for success. And I'm kind of – I'm not quite clear on where advertising's
going this year. Is it just up in line with sales, or are you increasing it above the pace of sales growth this year? Do you
have a need to rebalance it?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: In the fullness of time, I expect it'll be
rebalanced. It's actually up above the pace of sales this year as we go forward. So you'll see it up. It's a good question. I
do believe the quality is up significantly, and I know the spending is up above our growth in sales. So the net impact
should be significantly up, and the reach – the effective reach of the campaign in soup is significantly improved versus
where it was last year.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: And
we've seen some deflation in the cost as well in fiscal 2010.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, and on top of that, we're using significantly
more social media and other vehicles to reach consumers. So we've really diversified our marketing plan in an exciting
way, as will be very evident starting on September 6.
<Q -Robert Moskow>: Is it getting back to inflation, in fiscal '11, for media rates?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No.
<Q -Robert Moskow>: No, not yet? Okay, and then just one last thing. You said that the umbrella campaign is one of
your favorites; I'm glad you mentioned it. I've seen umbrella campaigns come and go, and often they tend to be used
because you want to make – you want to save money. You have three different parts you want advertised, so you put
them all together and you hope that the umbrella impact helps all of them a little more. What makes this campaign

better than others that you've tried in the past? I think you've tried them and then walked away, then tried them again.
What makes this one better?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: In my experience, we've only tried this one other
time since I've been here, in 10 years. A couple keys; one is it's all soup. So we're not trying some umbrella campaign
across different products. It's really across our condensed and ready-to-serve portfolio. And what we've found is, there
is – we have the beauty of the Campbell's trademark, which cuts across all of those soups very naturally. So we found a
natural campaign that tests extremely well with consumers, both for our specific brands of Chunky, Select Harvest, and
our condensed soups, and it also works for the whole line better.
<Q -Robert Moskow>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Okay. Next question, please, operator.

Our next question comes from Terry Bivens from JPMorgan.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Terry.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Doug, one thing we look at is the kind of average pricing per unit on soup. And if you look at the
2009 period, it was well down from 2008. So I'm trying to get a little more at pricing as we go into this year. To hit
your volume targets, how much higher do you think you need to go in promotion – or conversely, particularly with
ready-to-serve, are you happy with the price points, or is it possible we could actually get a list price decline?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Terry, we don't comment on pricing, but -
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: – we are very comfortable we know the price
points at which our products will move. That's for condensed and ready-to-serve and all the varieties of ready-to-serve.
And we're committed to hitting those price points in a timely, smart way with our customers, and each customer's a
little different. But we know exactly what we need to do from a price promotion perspective.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. And – I'm sorry, but just a quick follow-up. We hear from some retailers – I mean, they're
obviously concerned as well that soup has not done well in this environment. Have any retailers come to you and
proposed shrinking the shelf space? Have you heard anything of that nature?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: No.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Quite honestly, no. In fact, they view soup as
being very integral to the center of their store concept, and we're – as you know, we work with all the retailers very
closely on this category. And all the discussion is about how do I make it work better? And they're actively enrolled in
that program, and the response to our program for this coming year is as good as I've ever seen it. So we've grown soup
sales for seven years in a row. This year it's down. I expect it to be back up, as do they, and I think we can do it in a
win-win way with our retailers.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. Thanks very much. Have a nice holiday.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thanks. Same to you, Terry. We'll take one last one,
and then we'll wrap it up.

Our final question comes from David Driscoll from Citi Investment.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Great. I appreciate you taking the question. Craig, you made a number of comments to a few
other callers about gross margins. Can you just quantify what you expect to be the range of changes – plus 50 basis
points, whatever – for F '11?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Yeah,
I'm not going to give a basis point guidance number. What we've said is that we don't expect much pricing. We do
expect to be able to offset the 2 to 3% inflation that we would anticipate with our enabler program. And so I think the
net of that is that you could expect some modest expansion at gross margin. But I don't want to get into putting a stake
in the ground on a particular number.
<Q - David Driscoll>: I've got three other quick points or quick questions about the guidance. What's embedded in the
guidance as regards to share repurchase? What's the tax rate? And what's interest expense?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Tax rate
and interest expense, not much different from prior year. You saw the interest rate go up pretty significantly in Q4.
That was due to a financing that we did, but we have a financing rolling off in February that we believe will sort of
neutralize all of that across the year. So unless we see a big movement in rates somehow, we wouldn't expect interest
expense to be much different. Wouldn't expect tax rate for the full year to be much different. And share repurchase
program, we're still operating under a June 2008 authorization that was 1.2 billion. We don't announce the precise
amounts that we do, but that's the authority we're operating under.
<Q - David Driscoll>: But you can't say shares would be down 1 to 2% in F '11?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Well, in
F '10, we actually ran at a little bit lower than the 400 million a year that that 1.2 billion would imply, largely because
of the pension refunding that we did of about $260 million. We don't have that big of a pension nut to deal with this
year, so we'd probably come back more to the level that we were at prior year.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Final question. Cash flow from operations, would that be similar to the past year, or will it be a
bit better?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: I don't
have – again, probably the most extraordinary or unusual thing that we had in the cash flow last year was the 260
million that we put into pension. We've got about 100 million that has gone in at the beginning of this year. We gave
you our capital numbers in the call. There's nothing else extraordinary out there that we have.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Great. Really appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: All
right. Thank you.
Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations
Okay. And with that we'll end our Q&A session. Thank you, everyone, for participating in our fourth quarter earnings
webcast. As a reminder, a replay of our call will be available beginning in about two hours. If you're a reporter and
