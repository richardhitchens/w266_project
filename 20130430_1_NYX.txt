MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2013 NYSE Euronext Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at NYSE Euronext. Please go
ahead, sir.
Stephen C. Davidson
Thanks, Caroline.
Good morning, and welcome to the NYSE Euronext's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Before I introduce

Duncan Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter, update you on key
developments in our businesses and conclude with an update on the acquisition by ICE. Michael Geltzeiler, Chief
Financial Officer, will then review the financial results for the quarter. We will then open the line for your questions.
Also in the room for the Q&A session is Larry Leibowitz, Chief Operating Officer.
We are incorporating slides for the call today, which are available for viewing on our website, and Duncan and Mike
will refer to the slides during their remarks.
With that, let me turn the call over to Duncan.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Thanks, Stephen.
Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining today's call. I'll begin my prepared remarks on slide four.
In the first quarter, we benefited from the actions that we've taken over the past several quarters to improve the
fundamental earnings power of the company. We saw improved trading volumes in our European Derivatives franchise
and launched new products. We are on track to transition our UK clearing to ICE Clear Europe by the end of June and
we're focused on realizing the value of our continental derivatives clearing after the first quarter of 2014. We're
continuing to see strong momentum in our listings business, achieving a 75% market share of tech IPOs in the first
quarter, on the heels of last year's similarly excellent results.
We are beginning to generate incremental revenue from our new market-data agreements. We've continued to reduce
our expenses and are on track to exceed our full-year 2013 guidance. And lastly, the reduction in our share count and
other capital-management actions we have taken are beginning to have a meaningful impact on earnings.
The macro backdrop, as I noted on our last call, continues to show encouraging signs for the global economy. So I am
optimistic that we are on a slow trend up, punctuated by event-driven volatility along the way.
In the meantime, we are continuing to execute against our Project 14 commitments to our shareholders, and also
preparing for our combination with ICE, which I will go into in more detail on later slides.
The net result of all of this is that we reported $0.50 – $0.57 a share on $600 million in revenue this quarter, which
represents a 21% increase in earnings year-over-year, and a 33% increase quarter-over-quarter. So in summary, we are
pleased with our results, and we are looking to build momentum as we move through 2013 and into our proposed
combinations with ICE.
Please turn to slide five. Slide five is familiar to all of you and illustrates the strong progress we've made in executing
against our strategy. As you can see from this slide, we are not taking our foot off the gas. I will highlight a couple of
initiatives on the growth side first.
We are launching new derivatives products. In our Liffe business, we continue to move out on the yield curve.
Remember, our Liffe business in the UK has historically been almost entirely focused on the short-end of the curve. So
we've continued to expand with mid-curve options that we launched last year and the Swapnote products that we're
now offering, which move us further out on to the yield curve. Once we're in the ICE clearinghouse in the second half
of this year, expect to see us launch even more new products.
Next, we continue to be very focused on maintaining the position we enjoy in the capital formation and listings
business. We were number one in 2011, we were number one in 2012, and we're off to a terrific start this year.
The success we had last year, winning 80% of the big tech deals, has continued into 2013. And given the pipeline we
can see and the deals we know we have already won, some of which have not been made public yet, we believe that
this will continue.

Lastly, we are about to see the result of having revamped all of our global market-data agreements and launching some
new products in that business. All of these growth initiatives are complemented by our accomplishments on the
efficiency and capital-management fronts, which positively impacted our results this quarter.
Please turn to slide six. Slide six provides an update of our FICC businesses. We saw a nice rebound in NYSE Liffe
volumes in the first quarter, which were up 36% year-over-year, with FICC product volume in Europe up 53% when
compared with the same period last year.
In the upper left quadrant, our flagship Euribor futures contracts registered an all-time high in trading volumes, and
ADV for the first quarter of 2013 was 1.2 million contracts, an 82% increase from the last quarter. The surge in volume
was driven by a number of key events in the Eurozone, including early LTRO repayments by banks to the ECB in
February, uncertainty surrounding the Italian elections and the Cyprus bailout, as well as heightened expectations of a
potential rate cut.
Euribor options also showed even stronger growth this quarter, driven by the continued success of our innovative
mid-curve option products, which reached an ADV of 680,000 contracts, a 143% increase from the fourth quarter. The
aforementioned Euro Swapnote product which has been a focus for growth has had a solid start to the year.
Year-to-date Swapnote volume has traded $27 billion of notional, and by way of reference to CME swap futures traded
$19 billion of notional year-to-date.
Among other products, Gilts, in the upper right-hand quadrant of the slide continue to benefit from quantitative easing
by the Bank of England. In the lower left-hand quadrant, you can see that are in our Liffe U.S. business, we've seen
positive volume growth in open interest trends for the first quarter in the MSCI product suite, with ADV up 89%
year-over-year and open interest up a 119% year-over-year. Momentum also continues to build for futures on the
DTCC GCF Repo Index as shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the slide. We experienced record volume days in
January and average daily volume is up 56% sequentially. Before moving away from the FICC business, I wanted to
reiterate our stance on clearing for our UK derivatives business. We are on track as discussed previously to transition to
ICE Clear Europe at the end of the second quarter. All of our regulatory filings have been submitted. The technology
build has been completed. And in May, we expect to step up our technology integration and member testing.
Please turn to slide seven. Slide seven provides you with selected updates in our equity derivatives businesses. First on
the left-hand side of the slide, let's talk about U.S. options. In January 2013, the NYSE Amex Options and NYSE Arca
Options complex reached their highest monthly combined equity options market share to date of 29.4%. We were also
the first options exchange to receive SEC approval to begin trading mini options of product design for the retail
investor, which we launched on March 18.
Product innovation and development continued to be a focus and in the first quarter, we were able to secure a
semi-exclusive licensing agreement with the Russell Index Group. These products began trading this month. On the
right hand side of the slide, we talk about our FTSE equity derivatives franchise. This franchise provided a strong start
to the first quarter with volumes up 29% year-over-year, the increase in volumes sort of returned to trading in our core
FTSE derivatives franchise. The FTSE 100 Index Options were up 86% versus the same period last year and the
combined open interest for the FTSE franchised at 13% above 2012 levels.
Please turn to slide eight. Slide eight provides you with a snapshot of our cash equities business, taking a particular
look at trading volumes and net trading revenue. Over the past few years, our objective in the cash trading businesses
has been to focus on profitability and stabilizing market share. In Europe, we have maintained our share at around 65%
and pricing has been relatively stable. In the U.S., we have opportunistically looked for ways to increase pricing, which
has helped to soften the impact of declines in trading volumes and the growth in off-exchange trading, which has
impacted our market share.
Before moving on to the next slide, I want to address two important issues impacting these businesses: the Financial
Transaction Tax in Europe and off-exchange trading in the U.S. First, let's talk about the state of play with regard to the
FTT. As many of you may recall, the Commission issued a proposal on February 14 for a broad-based tax on equities,
equity-like products, derivatives, bonds and others, which only applies to those member states, but could have

extra-territorial impact.
In terms of the enhanced cooperation group, there was no agreement between the 11 countries as to how the tax will be
collected, on what products it should be collected, or how the proceeds would be used. In fact, several heads of national
debt management agencies including France and Italy have publicly warned that the FTT could push up yield spreads
and increase borrowing costs.
Given all these issues, the Commission's implementation date of January 1, 2014 seems optimistic. It continues to be
our view that this tax has currently outlined would likely destabilize the European financial markets, negatively impact
returns, and increase fees for average investors in mutual fund owners exactly the wrong policy at the wrong time. Any
policy measure that has the direct effect of draining liquidity from the capital markets is a measure that will hurt
European entrepreneurs, especially the SMEs that so desperately need to access the markets to finance their growth.
But given that this dialog continues, it bears watching.
Shifting to the U.S. with regard to off-exchange trading, off-exchange trading reached a record level of 36% in the first
quarter of 2013, up from 34% in the fourth quarter. To be clear, we think that this is not just about dark pools. Dark
pools are only one-third of off-exchange trading, the other two-thirds is internalization. While we think there is a place
for alternative execution venues, we worry about the aggregate effect of off-exchange activity on market quality and
question whether the pendulum has swung too far.
As such, we plan to continue raising awareness with regard to our market quality concerns and we'll also continue our
levels of playing field advocacy efforts here in the U.S. We are looking forward to working closely with Mary Jo
White, the new Chair of the SEC. Mary Jo has a stellar reputation. She understands the issues that we face with the
fragmentation of our markets, and I am confident that we will be able to work together as an industry with the
regulators to improve market quality.
Please turn to slide nine. On slide nine, we show the continued momentum in our listings franchise. We ranked number
one in IPOs year-to-date 2013 and follow-on proceeds globally, raising $12.1 billion in total global proceeds from 26
IPOs and $48.3 billion in total global proceeds from 140 follow-on offerings in the first quarter of 2013. In the U.S., we
led the market with 17 IPOs excluding closed-end funds and continued to capture the majority of technology-based
IPOs.
We saw larger deal sizes from larger companies coming to the market. Private equity-backed companies, which made
up about 35% of the market year-to-date carve out in yield-oriented deals drove the volume in the first quarter. We
listed six of the eight private equity-backed IPOs in the first quarter, which raised a total of $1.8 billion or 68% of all
proceeds from private equity-backed IPOs. In Europe, we welcomed six companies to our markets including Infosys,
which was the first company to be admitted to trading on our markets in London, Paris, and New York.
Please turn to slide ten. Slide ten outlines the new strategic paradigm for the technology business that we introduced
last quarter. While the market continues to be challenging for technology sales as you saw on our first quarter results,
the market demand for disruptive technology is increasing and we have also increased our dialog with global trading
organizations regarding game changing service offerings, the hosting of matching engines, and open connectivity to
global markets. The trading community is becoming even more focused on cost optimization and is looking to us as a
trusted partner to provide innovative ways to improve your trading infrastructure models.
Regulatory obligations continued to increase, resulting in additional assets required to be traded on exchange. NYSE
Technologies is working closely with customers to address these needs throughout our product and solution suite. And
NYSE Technologies has the data center and solutions set to be well-positioned to take advantage of this industry shift.
So, how was this shift in paradigm translating into results, our client, the Warsaw Stock Exchange successfully
completed its migration of its cash and derivatives markets to UTP and connected to our safety network which will
extend their reach across NYSE Euronext global market data and trading infrastructure.
In terms of our large scale infrastructure hosting capabilities, we are working with several global trading organizations
to provide comprehensive trading infrastructure managed services. These are large recurring revenue transactions. We
launch the best trades in "market data product", which provides substantial cost savings to retail brokerage firms and

wealth management organizations who require access to level one data products.
And lastly, we are beginning to generate incremental market data revenue that will build through the second half of
2013, and we have significant plans for our SuperFeed business that will begin to generate additional revenue in the
second half as well.
Before I move onto the next slide, I wanted to address the recent media coverage of our NYXT business. Jon Robson,
the leader of that business, has strengthened his leadership team, which is focused on executing against the strategic
vision I just outlined. At the same time, we're working with ICE to explore how we will leverage this important
business capability in the new organization post merger.
As we look to expand our capabilities for clients, we regularly have discussions with potential partners, clients, and
industry participants to explore new opportunities to deliver best-in-class solutions for our trading community. We have
always conducted these partnership discussions and we will continue to have discussions with partners now and in the
future both traditional and non-traditional. We have an exciting business for significant potential that we will continue
to drive forward.
Please turn to slide 11. The next two slides focus on the transaction with ICE. Slide 11 is a quick review of the
compelling nature of the combination. When you look at the combined business, you see a company with a completely
different complexion than the one we have today. The Cash Trading segment, which is arguably the most competitive
and commoditized part of our business, generated 7% of our revenues in the U.S. and 9% in Europe in 2012. This
combined 16% would decline to around 10% of the combined company and even less after the envisioned IPO of
Euronext. The more lucrative and competitively stronger derivatives business, which is 26% of our revenues in 2012
would increase to 44% of the revenue base for the new company.
Most importantly, almost 50% of our pro forma net revenue will be generated from this derivatives – from our
derivatives businesses. This is a critical aspect of the transaction because of the relatively high margin and its impact on
our overall valuation. We are excited about the potential and remain confident that our companies can unlock
significant value and growth, the confidence the market seems to share. We believe the change will be a constant in our
industry for some time to come and our combination brings the experience, assets, and leadership together that is
necessary to drive sustainable growth for our investors and our clients.
Please turn to slide 12, which will be my last slide before I turn it over to Mike. We put this slide in deck, because
we've gotten a lot of questions about next steps in the transaction timeline, so we thought we would lay it out for
everybody on this slide. We are currently working on two parallel tracks. One focused on the competition approval
process and the other on general transaction requirements that are needed to close the deal. On the competition side, we
completed the U.S. process with the DOJ under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and we are now focusing on the European
requirements. Last week, we received the official referral of the competition review to the European Commission from
the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain. So, we are now working towards the completion of our notification of the
Commission known as Form CO, which will serve as the basis for the competition review.
Upon the receipt of our notification, the European Commission will begin Phase 1, which is a 25 business day review
process. If an in-depth investigation of the transaction is required, so called Phase 2, that would start a 90-day clock
after that. As we've learned in the past, the timelines for these review processes are not guaranteed and they are just
guiding principles and are subject to further extensions based on circumstances. But we've already made good progress.
Our Form S-4 has been filed with the SEC and has been deemed effective by the SEC as of today. And on the back of
that both companies, both we and ICE, have set the date for the shareholder vote on June 3. We still believe that this
transaction will be finalized in the second half of this year.
Our conversations are also ongoing with all stakeholders involved with the IPO of Euronext, which we expect will
follow soon after the closing of the primary transaction. We will continue to be transparent about the process and keep
you updated on key milestones and developments.
With that, I would now like to pass the call over to Mike for review of the first quarter's financial results.

Michael S. Geltzeiler
Thanks, Duncan, and good morning.
Slide 13 provides comparative GAAP results for the first quarter of 2013. Our GAAP EPS was $0.52 per share, which
compares favorably to the $0.34 per share we reported in Q1 2012. Our non-GAAP EPS, a $0.57 per share, reflects two
primary adjustments this quarter as reconciled in the schedule.
In the quarter, we reported an $8 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, primarily related to the ICE
transaction. The other item was a $10 million pre-tax charge to fair value outstanding restricted stock awards, resulting
from the increase in our stock price.
Following recent shareholder approval of our amended plan, outstanding restricted stock awards will again be fixed in
value under equity settled accounting rules. As a result, equity compensation costs in the second quarter of 2013 will
decline by $10 million and fee adjustment. After adjusting for these items, we derived non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 per
share.
And our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses, exit costs,
the stock-based compensation charge I discussed, and discrete tax items.
Slide 14 provides our non-GAAP financial results for the quarter. Net revenues of $600 million on a reported basis
were in line with the first quarter of 2012, went up 7% versus the fourth quarter. The increase quarter-over-quarter was
driven by higher volumes in our Global derivatives businesses.
Reported costs were lower by $25 million or 6% driving a 12% growth in operating income. Diluted share count
declined by 15 million shares year-over-year from our 2012 share repurchase plan, which helped drive EPS growth to
21% for the quarter.
Slide 15 and 16 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivatives revenue in the first quarter
was $201 million higher by 14% year-over-year and up 26% sequentially, attributable to a strong pickup in trading
volume. Euribor future volumes in particular increased 82% on both Arca and Amex Options reported growth in both
market share and ADV.
The revenue growth on flat costs helped boost EBITDA margins to 56%. Derivatives accounted for 34% of our
consolidated net revenues and 43% of our operating income. Revenue capture for NYSE Liffe was lower
year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, attributed primarily to clients hitting volume tiers with the increase in
volumes. Capture for the U.S. options business was higher year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter driven by positive
mix.
Similarly slide 17 and 18, show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading
and Listings accounted for 48% for our consolidated net revenues and 47% of our operating income in the first quarter.
Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $287 million in the first quarter of 2013, down 6% versus the prior year
period, was up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.
European cash market share across our four primary markets, which excludes off-exchange trading volume, was 65%
in the first quarter, up from 64% in the prior year. In U.S. cash equities, our market share across all tapes declined 120
basis points, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.
Off-exchange traded share increased to 36% of the U.S. equities market, up from 34% in the prior year. Global listings
revenues, including government services which we report in other revenues, is up 9% in the first quarter.
Revenue capture for U.S. cash increased to $0.043 per 100 shares handled for Q1 above the $0.042 recorded in the first
quarter of 2012 and the $0.040 in Q4. Incremental increase in capture is due to volume mix and minor pricing
adjustments on NYSE Arca.

Revenue capture for European cash on a per-transaction basis increased to $0.62 in Q1 2013 from $0.57 in Q1 2012
and $0.58 in Q4 2012. The increase year-over-year was driven by an increase in trade size and a decision to reduce
listing fees for European warrants and increase trading fees.
Slide 19 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information
Services and Technology Solutions accounted for 19% of our net revenue and 10% of our operating income in the first
quarter of 2013. Segment revenue was $112 million, a decrease of $9 million from Q1 prior year and a decrease of $8
million sequentially. As Duncan mentioned earlier, the sales shortfalls were attributed to the absence of any significant
new managed services sales whereas the prior quarter at large sales with Russell and ATG in Q4 and Warsaw in Q1
prior year.
The environment continues to be challenging, but we believe that this business is well positioned to leverage the
industry's focus on cost optimization and changing infrastructure models. With the new global market data agreements
in place, we expect to see technology services revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of 2013. These incremental
revenues will begin in Q2 and expected to grow as the year progresses.
Slide 20 provides you with the progress we've made with our Project 14 cost efficiency program. Over the past 12
months, we have reported total operating expenses of $1,556 million, which is a $110 million below the 2011 base
level of $1,666 million. Adjusting for currency rates and portfolio changes in discrete investments of $49 million, we
arrived at an annualized expense base of $1,522 million to the first quarter 2013, which is a $144 million below our
2011 starting point or 58% of the total $215 million to be saved by the end of 2014.
You'll recall that our commitment for P14 savings was originally 65% of the $215 million by the end of 2013. So, we're
well on our way to exceed this target. Based on the positive development of expenses in the first quarter and a series of
savings initiatives planned for this year, including the $15 million we expect to save in the second half of 2013 with our
moves to ICE Clear Europe, we now expect our full year 2013 reported expenses to be less than $1,525 million.
Slide 21 details our cash and debt position as of the end of the March. Gross debt at March 29 was $2.5 billion. This is
basically the same level of debt that we had at year-end, as we did not have any variable debt that we can pay down
with our excess cash from the quarter. Our cash balances grew by $147 million in the quarter.
In June, we plan to retire the remaining $414 million of 4.8% U.S. notes. Our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio decreased
to 2.3 times on stronger EBITDA generation. And we've been able to use our excess cash to retire debt leverage would
have been reduced to 2.2 times for the quarter.
Capital expenditures were $27 million in the quarter, well within our guidance of less than $150 million for the full
year. And last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2013, which is
payable on June 28.
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Thanks, Mike.
So in closing, the first quarter was a very strong start for us to 2013. We saw a rebound in trading volumes in our
European Derivatives franchise and we launched some new products. We're on track to transition our UK derivatives
business clearing to ICE Clear in Europe by the end of Q2. Our listings franchise, continue to build momentum by
maintaining the number one global leadership position and achieving a dominant market share of technology IPOs. We
expect to begin seeing the positive revenue impact of our new market data agreements in the current quarter. And
lastly, our costs are on track to exceed our full year 2013 cost guidance.
While we are executing against our Projects 14 commitments, we are also well into the integration planning and
regulatory approval processes of our combination with ICE. And the next milestone for that combination will be the
shareholder meetings on June 3.

With that, we will take a few questions from all of you. Thanks for listening.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Please standby for your first question, which comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Sandler
O'Neill.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning, Rich.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Good morning, Rich.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: I guess the first question, Duncan, comes from your remarks on market quality. We know,
or at least, report was put in the meeting, you've met with the SEC with some of the other exchange heads. I think I'm
aware of your meeting with even some companies as well. But when you talked about like what are the remedies if a
third of the TRF volume is – looks like you're pointing towards the wholesalers, the other two-thirds, what are the
remedies besides a trade-at rule, do you see we could bring back the market quality you're talking about?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yeah. I'll start Rich and then I'll let Leibo add to it as well. So, we realized it's a
complicated question. This didn't happen overnight. Our point that we keep trying to focus on is that this isn't just about
dark pools. If we're talking about dark pools and those are block crossing networks that provide a significantly better
customer experience that the public market may not be able to provide, I think there has to be a place for those in
market structure in the U.S.
I think our bigger concern and to be clear, we think it's going to have to be a combination of things that would get done.
I don't think there's one single thing that would necessarily enhance the market quality. But we feel like there is a
degradation in market quality, the darker individual stock seem to get the wider the spread seems to get. We don't think
that's a healthy trend and whether it's talking about some kind of a trade-at rule that simply requires an internalizer to
improve the customer experience in either size or price, the way they've done in Canada and are talking about doing in
Australia or thinking about, a rethink of the access fees. There is a whole host of things that could be done. We realize
this isn't – it took us a longtime to get here. It's going to take us a while to kind of reverse the trend, if it's even possible.
But I'm encouraged by the fact that a lot of people are at least willing to come to the table to talk about it. Right? We're
meeting with investors. We're meeting with a number of sell side firms. We're all meeting together and having
roundtables to talk about is there a better solution that would be better for the end clients? And I'm cautiously
optimistic.
Leibo, what would you add to that?
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: I think it's a pretty good summary.
I just think that if you add up all the regulatory changes made over the last 10 years, they've sort of caused just a natural
competitive force that will drive more and more volume off-exchange, as other parties get more and more sophisticated
about segmenting customer flow, or re-circulating flow before it gets to an exchange, so that what gets to the exchange
is lower and lower quality.
And I think what we're really concerned about is not – it's not our market share. It's about what's the quality of the flow
that comes to the exchange? How wide do the spreads get? Those sorts of things. That's our main concern.
And we understand that this is going to be a balancing act where exchanges are going to have to give something, and
that we're going to have to put this together in a piece that it makes natural sense for competition to find the right level.

<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Right. And look, we expect everyone to defend their business model. And people
should expect us to defend the sanctity of the public quote, right? Everyone's doing what they should do.
So I think we're going to remain engaged in this dialogue. And we're happy to sit down with everybody and put other
things on the table, too, if that's what it takes to strike the right compromise. Okay? Thanks.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Howard Chen from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Hi, Howard.
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Hi, Howard.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Just with respect to the new global market-data agreements coming into place, is your
expectation still that the incremental revenue opportunity is about 10% additive on a full run rate? And if user and
terminal count continue to trend a bit lower, how much does that eat into the potential upside?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Yeah. I'll take the first part of that. In terms of the run rate, we had previously said that
we expect the series of changes. The new products that we're launching, the price increases, and the restructuring of the
global data agreements, including addressing the non-display access to generate a double-digit growth, yes.
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: And I think it's the last – it's hard to predict where that trend is going to go. Remember
that a – it's an overall industry issue. It impacts the size of the entire CPA pie, not just specifically us.
But we're sort of dealing with that by being more aggressive, more balanced, I would say, in how we charge for
non-display and the proprietary products we sell ourself. Because we are developing a lot more of these proprietary
products. So we expect that would offset those things.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Understood. Thanks, Larry. Thanks, Mike.
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Thanks, Howard.
Operator
Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Chris Allen from Evercore.
<Q - Chris J. Allen>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Good morning, Chris.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Chris J. Allen>: I just wanted to ask on the Information Technology segment. Just given the upcoming deal with
ICE and some of the recent articles in the press about potentially looking at other partners, which you guys
acknowledged maybe some discussions there, is it realistic to expect any large signing of agreements in that business
until kind of the dust settles in that front? People could figure out who they're going to be dealing with longer term?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Sure. I think it's a really good question, Chris.
I think what you're seeing here is an industry that's in transition. Our clients are going from buying products to trying to
figure out how to rationalize large chunks of infrastructure. And the technology itself is in transition, with more and
more emphasis on cloud and virtualized computing and managed services, Software-as-a-Service, things like that.

So to some extent, some of the hesitation you're seeing is that the things they are demanding are changing, and the
organizations themselves are trying to figure out the new solutions.
At the same time, our portfolio of solutions is changing to match that, transitioning from some of the more traditional
product-based to more of a solutions-based thing. The backdrop of that, of course, is this ICE deal.
So yeah, I think that we're certainly going to get those questions, and we would expect to get those questions. On the
other hand, we're always looking to figure out what's the best combination of our portfolio with partners. That's been
our way of doing things, anyway. And you've got a new management team in there led by John Robson that's really
thinking about how they provide the best solution set.
So I would expect that the industry is in transition, but that we will start to see – and we are actually seeing contracts
signed. The results kind of hide some of the more traditional products are decreasing, while some of the new products
are actually increasing. And we probably have to do a better job with you guys at showing the pipeline and showing
that transition, so you see how that transition is going.
But we are signing new deals. It hasn't ground to a halt. And some of the new deals are actually larger deals and longer
deals. And I would expect that will continue.
<Q - Chris J. Allen>: Thanks, guys.
Operator
The next question we have comes from the line of Alex Kramm. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Hey, good morning. Maybe just to stay on the topic of what Chris just talked about on the
technology business. Can you maybe try to give a little bit more color on how you would break this business down, or
how this business breaks down, in terms of what are the pieces that are actually really essential to an exchange, like
market data? How much of that – how much do they account for?
Then on the other side, when we talked to some of your customers, it seems like a lot of the pieces are not very well
integrated, and they don't really talk to each other as much. So do you actually think that there are some smaller
components that are very easily to – easy prone to an auction, and see if some private equity holders would like to buy
more? Do you think this business is actually is more of a – this has to go as a whole or stay together as a whole? Thank
you.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Sure. I mean I can help you a little bit with this.
As Larry mentioned, we have discussed in the past, where we restructured this businesses into three primary – as the
chart shows you, three primary revenue segments: content, infrastructure and liquidity. And the two largest being
content and infrastructure.
So in the content area, it's the proprietary market data, the data fee handlers, some of the software sales.
In the infrastructure, we have the connectivity, the safety services and the hosting, and the NYFIX business. And then
liquidity, we have the colocation services, some of the market solutions we're doing for other exchanges, and
businesses like our Metabit operation in Japan.
So it is a pretty diverse segment. Clearly, the larger area of growth for this year we're looking at is in content, because
that's where the market data initiatives are coming in. But we have initiatives across the – hosting is where a lot of these
managed-services deals come in. I think Larry was talking a little bit about the colo and the connectivity that have both
new sales, and also some lower renewals at times. But that is really how we break the business down into those three
businesses.

<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Right. And I think your observation that says that we haven't integrated some of these
offerings is dead on. And it's actually consistent with what I was saying about moving from a product-based sale to an
integrated solutions-based sale. Some of that reflects the industry's attitude changing, and some of it reflects that we
need to do a better job of that, and that's exactly what John and his team are working on.
I think to speculate that we're going to sell various pieces off to private equity – the honest truth is it's in our
competitors' interest to sort of fan those flames, so that everybody thinks that these are weak assets.
The truth is that most of our competitors are in reasonable amount of transition themselves in this arena. And I think
that actually creates a lot of opportunity for natural providers of these solutions like we are, because we have the
market. We have the connectivity. We have the market data. We have a lot of the pieces that actually naturally sort of
go into that. And people would like to portray this as a weak position, whereas I actually view it as a strong hand.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yeah, or I'm going to add one more thing to that, not to belabor the point. We think we
have a pretty good idea of the origin of the leak last week.
We actually think it was one of our competitors doing exactly what Larry just said, like fanning the flame of
uncertainty, given the deal that's out there. And then coming in behind and saying, well, it's really hard to do something
with those guys. I mean they are in a state of flux over there. It's like, well, we're not in a state of flux just because a
competitor says we are in a state of flux because it suits their marketing pitch.
So I'm at a lot of these meetings, Larry is at a lot of these meetings. These are much more complicated discussions than
a product sale, right? A product sale, you show someone an a la carte menu, they want one item or two. This is a much
more comprehensive discussion about sharing infrastructure and things like that.
So we're going to remain optimistic, and we'll remain focused, and as we get closer to combining with ICE, we'll be
able to get the benefit of their input, as well.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Niamh Alexander from KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. And if I could switch over to the clearing. And so ahead
of the deal even, you're moving at the end of the May, as you previously guided.
But can you walk me through how to think about [ph] the risk of clients (43:42) – how easy can it be – should it be for
clients? There already is some technology overlap.
And then from the modeling perspective, financially, doesn't this accelerate some of the cost savings? Does it
accelerate maybe some impairments and some write-downs on some of the investment so far, as well?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: So I'll try to give you – it's Duncan, Niamh. I'll try to give you the outline on sort of
what we're doing on the timeline, and then Mike can talk a little bit about how that will translate to the results
beginning in Q2, and what that means for what we've already spent on what we used to call project Gemini, et cetera.
So as I said in my remarks, the project to move the UK derivatives piece from Liffe Clear to ICE Clear is on track to
happen at the end of the Q2. So it'll be the end of June, not the end of May. We will be using May to sort of do member
testing. We're collecting all the [ph] Novation (44:31) certificates now. That's all going very smoothly.
The nice thing about this transition is, given that more than 90% of the clients who are connected to Liffe Clear were
also connected to ICE Clear, there was very little migration risk. There were only a handful of clients that actually had
to do a meaningful technology lift to get this done. The majority of clients were already connected and were actually
relieved that there was less work to do for them than there would have been had we proceeded down the Project
Gemini route.

So, we're highly confident that will happen by the end of June. So, we will be clearing ICE Clear in the second half of
the year. And then Mike can talk to you about what that means for the kind of results going forward, and what we're
doing with the expenses that we had already put to work on Gemini last year and before?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Sure.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: So, the financial benefit, Niamh, of this transaction is really twofold. Firstly, when we go
live in beginning of the second half, we will no longer be outsourcing the treasury and risk management with LCH and
in turn we will be using ICE Clearing as we've indicated on the call. We will save annualized $30 million from that,
$15 million in the second half. The investment that we made in Gemini in our internal build last year prior to signing
the ICE Clear agreement was all written off in the fourth quarter last year. So, there is nothing else on the balance sheet
right now as related to that.
Secondarily, we have the continental derivatives, which we talked about in the past that we today don't get any
revenues or costs and we expect in first quarter, end of the first quarter 2014, to realize the revenues on that business
and a healthy margin as we also bring that business – execute that plan. So, two strong financial benefits, second half of
this year and 2014 coming from clearing.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Thanks, Niamh.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: I think we're going to wrap it there. So, Stephen any, we are going to give you the last
word, anything you want to do to wrap it up.
Stephen C. Davidson
Thanks everyone for joining us and see you later.
