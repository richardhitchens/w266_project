MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call. At this time all lines are in listen-only mode for the duration of
today's conference. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections please disconnect at this time. Today's call
will feature a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Jeremy, and welcome to our second quarter call. As usual we may be making statements within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I'll give a brief overview and then
Steven Kean, our CEO, will talk about the quarter's performance and give you an update on our project backlog and
then as usual Kim Dang, our CFO, will give you all the financial details, and then we'll take any and all questions that
you may have.
We raised the dividend to $0.49 for the second quarter. We're on track to meet our target declaring $2 for full year 2015
with substantial excess coverage even after adjusting for the current commodity prices, and we expect to grow our
dividends by 10% each year from 2016 through 2020.

It's difficult to compare this quarter with the second quarter of 2014 because, of course, we completed our merger of all
the Kinder Morgan entities only in November of last year. With that said let me share what I believe are some relevant
numbers with you.
In this quarter we had approximately 2.2 billion shares outstanding versus about 1.034 billion in the second quarter a
year ago. We declared a dividend of $0.49 versus $.43 a year ago. We had DCF per share of $0.50 this quarter versus
$0.32 a year ago. We had excess coverage in this quarter of $20 million versus a shortfall of about $113 million in the
second quarter last year; and year-to-date for 2015, we've had excess coverage of $226 million versus $25 million for
the first half of 2014.
In terms of total DCF in this quarter, we had $1.095 billion versus $332 million 2014. Very importantly, we've
increased substantially our backlog of future projects as Steve will explain, and we think we're looking at a bright
future for natural gas demand. As an example of the increasing demand, the power generation throughput our set of
Natural Gas Pipelines was up 16% for the first quarter compared – from the second quarter compared with second
quarter of 2014. I might add anecdotally that's pretty consistent.
In Texas the overall demand for gas as a source of power generation increased its share year-to-date to 48% from 37%
in the first half of 2014. I think all of these factors and the numbers I've shared with you just demonstrate our belief that
the strength of our assets even in times of volatile and relatively low commodity prices continue to demonstrate that we
can produce stellar results even in these times.
And with that I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
All right. Thanks, Rich. So I'll update the projects for you and give you some operating highlights from the segment.
Since the April update, our project backlog increased by $3.7 billion, from $18.3 billion to $22 billion. That's great
progress and a sign of the strength of our network and the continuing need for additional midstream energy
infrastructure. [ph] This was fixed (3:43) to be an even bigger increase, but for some delays on a couple of deals that
we've been working on, worth about another billion. If and when we get those done, we'll announce those separately.
Now here are the main changes. We added $4.6 billion in new projects. And this is an important one, $3.3 billion of
that is the addition of a market path portion of Northeast Energy Direct, a natural gas pipeline expansion to serve the
New England market. We're expecting to proceed with that project. We're still working on the supply portion of that
project, and we've made significant recent headway on that loan as well, but not to the point where we're ready to add it
to the backlog. And when and if we do, that would be another $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion.
Going back to the market path portion, we have discussed in previous releases that we've got commitments for 562
barrels a day of capacity on that project. Much of that volume is currently going through the state public utility
commission review process, and we are optimistic about the outcome of those reviews. We're comfortable going
forward based on the commitments we have and the progress towards the state approvals on those commitments.
Number two, our confidence that we can extract value for short-term sales of a portion of the unsold capacity,
particularly during winter months; and third, just the overwhelming need for additional gas capacity to serve Northeast
markets.
This level of sign-up would get us to an accretive return, but we fully expect to add commitments on the power side
that will get us to a very attractive return. We preserve the ability to phase this project in as the commitments come in.
We're very enthusiastic about the project. The demand is already there and growing.
Besides NED, we added $700 million of investments to the Elba Island Liquefaction Project, primarily as a result of
buying out Shell and taking 100% of the ownership and management of that project. Shell remains the off-taker for
100% of the project capacity under a 20-year contract. This deal represents a restructuring of the previous arrangement
that we had with Shell. The main benefits that we are getting here are, of course, the opportunity to invest $2.1 billion

at an attractive return; and secondly, we get control of the project and with that control, we still expect a late 2017
in-service date. Shell benefits from secured cost reductions on the total project, which we expect to achieve, and still
earn an attractive return on the all-in investment.
In other portions of the backlog, we also added $100 million in other projects in the gas group, $100 million combined
between products and terminals, about $300 million in additional EOR investments over the timeframe of the backlog
in the CO2 segment, and so those will be additions. And during this timeframe, we put into service $700 million worth
of projects. The bulk of that explained by two things: $200 million relating to four further expansions and extensions of
a very successful Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate system serving the Eagle Ford Shale and multiple destination
markets on the Texas Gulf Coast. We also put into service $300 million of projects in the Terminals segment. The
majority of that is attributable to our Edmonton Crude by Rail joint venture with Imperial, which we placed in service
during the quarter.
We removed about $600 million from the backlog. Nearly all of that is further deferrals in our CO2 source field
investments outside the timeframe of the backlog. Part of this reduction is also related to scope efficiency, where we
are getting the same production with a smaller investment. We continue to believe that we can meet the current demand
outlook for CO2 by concentrating our source development activities on the core of our portfolio. So overall, we grew
the backlog by $3.7 billion, even while putting $700 million worth of projects into service. And as I mentioned, we
think we're close to adding still more.
Now to the segment review, but before going into the segment-by-segment review, I think it's worth backing up for a
moment and comparing where we were in Q2 of 2014 and where we are in Q2 of 2015. Over that period, the price of
WTI declined by 48%, and the price of natural gas declined by 43%. But in this quarter, we're reporting segment
earnings before DD&A that are up 2%, and we're reporting volumes that are up, and I'll go through those separately.
Certainly, there are a lot of moving pieces in there, including capital investments we've made, the commodity price
impact on CO2, et cetera, but it still sets a very important context through our performance and for the strength of our
business model in a wide variety of commodity environments.
All right, now for the segments. Starting with Gas, earnings before DD&A for the Gas Pipeline segment were $965
million, that's up 1% year-over-year. That's led by the addition of Hiland and improved year-over-year performance on
the EagleHawk gathering system, offsetting weaker performance in some of our other gathering and processing assets.
Also recall that year-over-year results in this segment are affected by a major shipper buying out of its contract on the
Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline last year.
We had higher transport volumes, up 3% across the segment, and we saw a 16% increase year-over-year, as Rich
mentioned, in the power burn across our systems. We had higher sales volumes, up 9% on our Texas Intrastate, as we
continue to see growth in our power and industrial markets in Texas.
Gas gathering volumes were also up 5%. We continue to see strong demand for long-term firm natural gas
transportation capacity. This is including the 562 associated with NED, but we added, over the quarter, 1.4 Bcf of
additional long-term transportation commitments, with a volume-weighted average term length of about 20 years. And
we added commitments in the East, Central and West regions and across LNG, LDC, and producer markets.
Over 400 of that is attributable to sales at existing capacity, showing again that we benefit from rising gas supply and
demand, not only in terms of new project opportunities, but also enhancing the values on some of our existing systems.
So that 1.4 Bcf addition brings the total capacity sign-up since December of 2013 to 8.7 Bcf of new and pending
long-term commitments. So again, the summary here for gas is, we continue to see strong demand for existing and
expansion capacity on our gas assets, and we believe that we're well-positioned for the growth that we see in this
market.
Turning to CO2, which is of course very much affected by commodity prices, segment earnings before DD&A in this
segment were $286 million, down $74 million, or 21%, year-over-year due to lower commodity prices for oil and
NGLs, and including the deteriorating ratio of NGL to crude prices. Our volumes are up year-over-year, led by

SACROC at 9%, and an overall increase of 8% net to Kinder Morgan across all of our enhanced oil recovery
developments.
Katz and Goldsmith are also up year-over-year, and of course are part of that 8% that I just mentioned. And we've
made recent significant progress on Goldsmith in particular. But we're still well under plan on both of those fields.
We're also extracting some significant cost savings in this price environment. We continue to forecast reductions in
OpEx and maintenance CapEx of just under 25% for the year.
Now turning to the Products Pipeline group. Segment earnings before DD&A were $275 million, up 32%
year-over-year, and that's driven by the ramp-up of volumes on KMCC, the addition of our Double H Pipeline with the
Hiland acquisition, and improved performance on SFPP, as well as better year-over-year results on Cochin. Now, recall
that Cochin was shut down for part of the quarter last year as we were completing the reversal project.
In this segment, we see the upside of lower commodity prices. Our refined products volumes are up 4% across all of
our systems year-over-year, in aggregate, led by higher gasoline volumes, particularly on our SFPP system. We
continue to advance our Palmetto Refined Products Pipeline, our Utopia NGL pipeline project. We also launched an
open season on our UMTP proposed pipeline closing in September of this year, but we still don't have that project in
our backlog.
Now we did suffer a setback on our Palmetto project. The Georgia Department of Transportation denied our request for
a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. We did get the approval we needed from FERC during the quarter.
A favorable ruling from Georgia DOT is not essential for us to proceed with the project, but we are appealing the
ruling, because it would help, and we're exploring all of our routing options to allow us to move forward with the
project.
All right. Turning to Terminals now. Segment earnings before DD&A were $271 million, up 16% from last year. 75%
of that is attributable to organic growth. We continue to see strong performance in our liquids facilities, and our
earnings benefited from expansions in Edmonton and the Houston Ship Channel, as well as higher year-over-year
results due to our Jones Act tanker acquisitions. We placed our Edmonton crude by rail facility into service, as I
mentioned.
On the bulk side, a different story. Steel volumes are lower, as are coal volumes. This segment was also hit by FX on
the Canadian portion of its operations. The liquids part of the segment, in addition to its strong performance in our
existing business, is also driving our future opportunity. It's almost – really every bit of our backlog in this business is
in the liquids part of the business.
As we continue to see promising opportunities in Houston Ship Channel, which we are actively pursuing, some of those
are in the backlog. There are others that we're pursuing that are not yet in there. We built great positions in two very
important hubs, Edmonton and Houston. In Edmonton our expansion projects, when complete, will bring our merchant
crude storage position to 12 million barrels, the largest in the area, and up from zero 10 years ago.
In Houston, our expansions will get us to 43 million barrels of liquid fuel storage, 45 million barrels when you count
our recent Vopak acquisition. So we continue to build strong positions in these two markets, and very importantly, we
continue to add connectivity to our assets in each of those markets, which further enhances the value of our positions
there.
Finally, Kinder Morgan Canada and a quick update on our expansion of Trans Mountain. First, we're still expecting to
see [ph] draft (15:04) conditions by the end of this month from the NEB, so that's fast approaching. We do expect to get
the final NEB recommendation in order in January of 2016. Intervener evidence was filed during the quarter and it's
fully expected, and as some of you probably read, it lit up the press, as the opposition got plenty of airplay. This wasn't
any surprise to us, and our Canadian team continues to do its job, fulfilling their outreach and consultation
responsibilities.
Most of our route, as a reminder, is along our current pipeline, except where a community or a landowner needs
dictated a variation. So we have existing relationships with many of the communities and First Nations along the way.

And as I mentioned last quarter, we have community benefits agreements in place that cover 87% of the route. We also
have agreements with about a third of the First Nations that are most directly affected by the project. We're working to
get more.
Progress is slower than we'd like on getting the expressions of support, but we are fulfilling the obligation we have to
consult and accommodate in any case. Remind you that the expansion is under long-term contracts which have been
approved by the NEB.
So overall, we think it was a very good quarter, with strong performance in a very significantly lower commodity price
environment year-over-year, and we made several strong additions to the backlog. And overall, I think, demonstrate the
value of our network and the continuing opportunities to expand off of that network.
So that's it for the segment and for the projects. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim for the numbers.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay. Thanks, Steve. And turning to the first page of numbers, which is the GAAP income statement. Let me just point
out a couple of things on this page. You can see that, in the quarter, similar to last quarter, revenues are down
significantly, $474 million. But you can also see that OpEx is down by almost the exact same amount, $475 million.
As I said last quarter, change in revenues is not a good predictor of our performance. We have some businesses where
revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not. We believe that the best
indicator of our performance is the cash that we generate, which metric we look at is DCF per share and the cash that
we pay our investors, which is the dividend per share.
So with that, I'll turn to the second page and look at DCF. DCF before certain items in the quarter, $1.095 billion, up
$763 million or 230%. Now, that is largely a function of not paying the limited partners as a result of the [ph] Fusion
(18:05) transaction, but it doesn't take into account the shares that we had to issue, the 1.1 million, approximately,
billion shares that we had to issue in the transaction.
So if you look at it on a per share basis, it takes into account both aspects of the transaction. And so we generated DCF
in the quarter of $0.50. That's up $0.18 or 56% from the second quarter a year ago. And year-to-date, DCF is $1.07,
which is up 23% from the six months ended June 2014. So our dividend in this quarter of $0.49 gives us coverage of
$20 million year-to-date. We have coverage, the $1.07 covers the $0.97 dividend, $226 million. And obviously, as Rich
mentioned, $20 million in coverage in this quarter versus $113 million deficit in the second quarter of 2014.
Looking up at the segments, we generated segment earnings before DD&A of $1.827 billion, that's up $35 million or
about 2%. Steve's taken you through each of the segments and what's driving that change.
Year-to-date, the segment earnings before DD&A, up $28 million or 1%. But I do want to take you through where we
are expecting the segments to come out versus our budget for the full year. We expect Gas to exceed its budget about
1% versus budget, largely as a result of the Hiland transaction. And then some of the benefit from the Hiland
transaction is being offset by direct commodity exposure, for which we gave you the metric at the beginning of the year
and about $35 million in lower volume as a result of lower commodity prices.
CO2 versus our budget for the full year, we're expecting that to come in in the range of about 13% below its budget,
and that's all a function of price. There are other moving factors, which largely offset each other. And the other things
that offset each other, we have cost savings in the segment, which are being offset by lower CO2 volumes and also
lower capitalized overhead of CO2 spending about $450 million less than what we originally budgeted.
Products Pipeline, we expect to exceed its budget largely as a – or all as a result of the Double H Pipeline, which came
in the Hiland acquisition. The benefit from that has a small offset from commodity prices consistent with the metrics
that we gave you at the beginning of the year.

I should go back and say, on CO2, that price impact is going to be greater than what you would see if you applied the
metrics that we gave you at the beginning of the year. And one of the main reasons for that is the deterioration in the
NGL to crude ratio. So we set – we had a set NGL to crude ratio in our budgets. NGL prices have deteriorated more
than crude prices, and so that's having overall, on Kinder Morgan, roughly a $40 million impact versus our budget,
most of which comes in the CO2 segment.
On Terminals, we expect them to end slightly below their budget for the year. You're seeing some weakness in steel
and coal. They have – there's an FX impact from a weaker Canadian dollar from our translation of earnings from
Canada. And then some of those detriments are being slightly offset by acquisitions, higher acquisition, contributions
from acquisitions than what we budgeted.
KMC is going to come in below its budget primarily as a function of [ph] ex-FX (22:41). So overall, segment earnings
before DD&A versus our budget, we're expecting it – the segment earnings to come in in the range of 1.5%, maybe
1.75% below our original budget estimate.
Now [ph] after the (23:02) segment is dropping down to look at G&A, G&A expense in the quarter was $164 million.
That's up $16 million versus a year ago. It's up $22 million year-to-date. Some of that is a result of the Hiland
transaction versus our budget. We expect to come in for the full year about 4% over our budget in G&A and that's
primarily a function of two things. One, the G&A as a result that we absorbed in the Hiland transaction; and two, lower
capitalized overhead than what we initially budgeted, and that's primarily because of the lower spending in our CO2
segment.
Interest in the quarter was a expense of $527 million. That's about $78 million higher than the second quarter of 2014.
That's all balanced. Actually, we had a slight savings on rates versus a year ago. Similar story for the $147 million
increase in the six months, it's all a function of balance. The balance in the six months is $7.3 billion higher than it was
for the first six months in 2014. And then we also have a slightly lower rate, which is giving us a benefit.
For the full year, we expect interest to be flat versus our budget. And what you're seeing there is the interest expense
from the Hiland acquisition being offset by lower balances and lower rates on the businesses that existed and the
expansion capital that we expected to spend in the budget.
So dropping down and looking back at our DCF calculation, which is net income plus DD&A, et cetera, the segment
earnings, the G&A and the interest that I just went through essentially takes care of the first four lines of that
calculation. The next line, cash taxes, which were an expense of $18 million in the quarter, so that's $282 million less in
expense than the second quarter in 2014 and $288 million on a year-to-date basis. And that's largely a function of the
consolidation transaction where we have more depreciation deductions as a result of a step-up in the assets and as a
result of all the depreciation staying inside of KMI rather than some of it being allocated to the limited partners.
The next line, other items, is primarily a function of the coverage that was at the MLPs. You can see that the largest
number in that column relates to 2014. And so when I think about it, I really net that number with the $669 million of
distributions that we made in 2014. Neither of those items impacts 2015, so we have a big change there.
Sustaining capital was $141 million of expense in the second quarter, and that's up about $13 million versus the second
quarter last year. It's up about $36 million on a year-to-date basis, but it's positive year-to-date versus our budget, but
that's primarily timing.
For the full year, we're expecting sustaining CapEx to come in above our budget, largely as a result of the Hiland
acquisition and also as a result of a relocation that we have on one of our natural gas pipelines. The variance on
sustaining CapEx for the year should largely be offset by a positive variance on cash taxes, so the two of those should
come pretty close to [ph] netting (27:04) for the full year.
Looking at the certain items in the quarter, the certain items were $23 million in the quarter. A number of those we
explained to you in past quarters, because they're recurring on a quarterly basis. The one that I will highlight for you is
a gain/loss on asset disposition and impairments of $50 million. That's primarily we made a decision to sell an asset or
some pipe in our Copano Oklahoma operations and there was a – it was a right economic decision. There was a loss on

that transaction, and a lot of that has to do with purchase price allocation and doing it, that purchase price allocation at a
very high level as opposed to going down and looking at the income on every little section of pipe.
So that is for the full year on coverage, we expect to end the year with over $400 million in coverage.
Now, if you utilize the metric we gave you at the beginning of the year, the $10 million change in DCF for every $1
change in crude oil price, plus the $3 million in DCF for every $0.10 change in gas, plus about in the range of $40
million impact for deterioration in the NGL ratio, you get pretty close to where we expect to be on a full-year basis. But
that probably oversimplifies the situation because there are lots of other moving parts.
Now all these other moving parts essentially net out, but let me just take you through some of those, so you're aware of
what's going on. We have the other buckets, we've got other commodity price impacts, which relate to – are outside of
the metric, a lot of which relates to lower CO2 volumes and lower midstream volumes as a result of a lower commodity
price environment. Also, lower revenues because of different contract mix on our CO2 sales.
You've got the impact from FX on the weaker Canadian dollar. We've got lower capitalized overhead, primarily as a
result of the $450 million in lower spending on CO2. And then these impacts are being offset by the accretion coming
from the Hiland transaction, interest savings and CO2 cost savings. So again, we expect to end the year with over $400
million in coverage.
And while we expect that to happen and obviously, and that's positive coverage for the year, we may have negative
coverage in the third quarter. We told you we thought that the second quarter, we might have it in the second quarter,
you can see we ended up on the good side of that equation with slightly positive. And the third quarter will be tight as
well. And as we tell you every year, we expect very strong coverage in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, and
generally the second and the third quarters are weak.
So with that I'm going to turn to the balance sheet. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $42.6
billion in debt. That results in a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.8 times. That's higher than the budget, primarily due to the
Hiland acquisition. We've got four-and-a-half months of the earnings, but we've got all the debt. We still expect,
consistent with our budget, to end the year at 5.6 times.
The change in debt for the quarter was a reduction in debt of $200 million. Year-to-date we've had an increase in debt
of $2 billion. And just to run through some of the largest pieces of that, for the quarter we spent about $900 million, a
little over $950 million on acquisitions, expansions and contributions to equity investments, with the expansion CapEx
being the biggest piece of that. We issued equity of and received cash for the equity that we issued of $936 million. We
had coverage of $20 million, as I told you previously. And then there are working capital and other items that were a
source of cash of about $191 million; the biggest piece of that being accrued interest and AP and AR, which was
somewhat offset by some legal settlements, some rate refunds on EPNG that we had already reserved for were the
primary offsets to that.
For the year, a $2 billion increase in debt. We've spent over $5 billion on acquisitions, expansion CapEx and
contributions to equity investments. Acquisitions were $3.3 billion. The largest acquisitions were the Hiland acquisition
for $3.1 billion and the Vopak acquisition of $158 million, both of which happened in the first quarter. We issued
equity of a little bit under $2.6 billion. We got an income tax refund for $200 million. We had coverage of $226
million, and then we had working capital and other items of about $16 million.
So with that I'll turn it back over to Rich for the Q&A.
Richard D. Kinder
Good. We'll take any questions you might have. Jeremy, if you'll come back on, we'll open it up for questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Christine.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Good afternoon.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: How are you?
<Q - Christine Cho>: Good. How are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Christine Cho>: So we've had some M&A attempts and announcements in recent weeks, one of which was an
unsolicited bid. We've talked about bid ask being too wide and maybe some companies not even thinking about putting
themselves up for sale. Would an unsolicited bid and maybe even going public with such an offer if any potential target
[ph] said no (33:33) be something on the table for you guys? I'm just asking because you guys did make an unsolicited
bid for El Paso on the heels of the KMI IPO back several years ago, so there is some history there, but wondering if
anything has changed on your side or if you even think anything out there is worth the trouble.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Christine, that's just so hard to kind of project into in advance. All acquisitions are very
circumstance-specific, and we wouldn't sit here and categorically say clearly – and even in the El Paso case – clearly
we've done deals on an agreed-to or negotiated basis. We would never say categorically that we wouldn't do it any
other way, right, but it's just too circumstance-specific for us to give you a definitive answer on that. Dax, anything you
want to add to that?
<A - Dax A. Sanders>: No, I think that sums it up. I mean, I would agree with your summary that bid offer spreads
still do sort of exist in a lot of places, obviously, you've seen certain situations where there's been some movement and
some deals getting done, and I think our thought is that – at least, my thought is that you'll probably see a little bit more
activity in the second half of this year than you've seen in a while. I think Steve's point about not speculating on any
tactic or certain situation is exactly the way we think about it.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay, great. And then I thought I saw that Gulf LNG filed a FERC application last month. It's
been fairly quiet with news on that front, so I was just curious what you were seeing on the customer contract side.
Also was the filing more of a check the box to have the regulatory side of things not be the bottleneck, or was it
something customers wanted to see you do before talking more seriously given the time it takes to receive approval?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: So, you're right, we did – yeah, it was filed on June 19, I believe, [indiscernible] (35:22) and it
is us continuing to advance that project. We continue to talk to customers about it. It is the last brownfield site that
hasn't been put under contract. We think it is a promising location and look, in the long term we're very bullish on U.S.
LNG and where it fits.
Clearly there's a pause that's been hit and there's a debate about how long that pause runs, what the real capacities are
out there and for how long the market might be somewhat oversupplied, but we think this is a good project and we're
looking at it in a timeframe that's early the next decade. So, I think it fits well with what the market recovery might
ultimately be shaped into.
But, Christine, as you know, we don't have it in the backlog. We're working the customer piece of it, having active
discussions, but nothing that we can really report to you that's anywhere near definitive at this point.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Great. And then the last one for me. Can you talk about the steps leading to Shell's decision to
sell its equity interest of the Elba JV? Did you approach them? Did they approach you, et cetera? Any color would be
helpful.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. We've been working together for a long time in developing this project, and costs have
been increasing on it and scope's been adjusted. I'm not going to speak for Shell at all, but you don't need to be a rocket

scientist to see that they bought BG. The market outlook on LNG has changed a bit. They wanted to restructure the
contract. We were certainly willing to restructure it on the terms that we got here and invest additional capital, $2.1
billion in total now, on the project, at the return that we're getting for it. And I think we got a different risk allocation.
Shell is retaining certain risks. We are picking up certain risks, but the risks that we are comfortable dealing with in
today's market environment for materials and construction services and the like. So we think we can do this project and
do it successfully. The added benefit from our standpoint is, I think I mentioned, is that we get control now. So this is
not a two-headed thing anymore. We've got control over this project and its development and construction, and we'll
get it built. And we're happy to have Shell as the customer on the facility, and we're very happy to be in charge.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And we're happy to put more money into this project at returns that we think are very good,
particularly given Shell credit for a 20-year contract.

And the next question is from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: How are you doing today?
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Good afternoon. Good, how are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Just a couple of quick questions. Steve, in your prepared remarks, you sort of talked about
how much the backlog has actually grown, and some of it is the acquisition, some of it is a project that you've been
talking about for some time. I was wondering if you can sort of give us some color, we're nine months into the
commodity collapse. The E&P budgets, from a CapEx perspective, have been coming down for the last six months.
How have the discussions about incremental ideas, concepts, logistics projects going at this point right now? Are things
slowing down? Are some opportunities cropping up? I was wondering if you can give us some insight as to how you
think the backlog would grow over the next 12 months, beyond the projects that you're hoping to add to the backlog at
this stage right now?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. Well, look, first broadly, clearly what affects our customers affects us. And so, the
backlog probably would have been growing even faster than it did in a different commodity price environment. And it
also affects a little bit who we're talking to, right. I mean as I said before, we had seen a lot of producer-pushed
projects. On the Gas side in particular, we started to see more market pull. Now it's interesting, this time that 1.4 Bcf of
sign-up is almost evenly divided, almost, not quite, across LDCs, producers and LNG. And so that's a little bit of a
counter, I think, to what we had been seeing.
But – so what affects our customers affects us, but we're – we think – it's a very positive sign that, in this commodity
price environment, we're growing the backlog where we are. And like I said, we came up to the brink on even more
additions, which I think we'll still get a good chunk of, and grow it from here. So I think just broadly, there are many
moving pieces and many markets that we're serving and addressing, and you have to kind of look at them individually
to see where the opportunities are.
We're still early stages for the really big demand pull. Beginning of next year, we start to see LNG pull. We are seeing,
this year, power demand pull. That 9% sales volume increase on the Intrastates was really quite remarkable, I think,
and shows you what we're seeing on industrial and power demand in the state of Texas. So those things are – and the
1.4 Bcf of contract sign-up. Those things are showing you that, even in a down market, our network is well-positioned
for the places where there is growth. And so, we still feel pretty good about our prospects and our ability to grow this
backlog from where we are.
You look out over the next 12 months, again, very hard to say, but we made a lot of progress on NED supply. We hope
to get that in the corral, but it's not there yet. We're working on UMTP, you know that's been a multi-year saga at this
point. Gulf LNG, we'll continue to work. And I think we continue to see operations or opportunities in John's business

on the liquids terminals side. As I mentioned, a lot going on in the Houston Ship Channel that we're actively
developing. We've started to see, again, not in the backlog, but on newbuild chemical facilities, some interest in the
chemical companies having their midstream infrastructure done by a midstream company, as opposed to making it part
of their project. So those are all things that I think are positive indicators, notwithstanding the fact that you've got a
down market and it's dragging down G&P investment, for example, on the negative side. So we still feel pretty good
about it and feel like we've got a good chance of continuing to add to the backlog even as we're rolling stuff in.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. Just as a follow-up question, I was wondering if we can talk about the balance
sheet for a second, kind of a two-part question. I understand your expectation to get to 5.6 times by the end of this year.
Is the commitment to the rating agencies to get it to this year? Or is it during 2016? And then, I was wondering if you
can also talk about the warrant repurchase program. It kind of seems counterintuitive to be buying back one side of the
capital structure while issuing equity on the other. Just sort of wondering if you can talk in the context of the overall
plan to delever?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Kim?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: On the commitment to the rating agencies, and this was in all the materials at the time
we did [ph] Project Fusion (42:48), which was, we were going to start out of the box at 5.6 times. We were going to
remain elevated for a couple years and that, when the larger projects, Trans Mountain and Elba, came on, that was the
biggest driver of deleveraging over that period.
So, that is still our expectation, and getting to 5.6 times at the end of the year is consistent with that, consistent with
what we show the rating agencies at the time of the transaction, and consistent with what we budgeted and they saw in
our budget when we published that in January.
On the warrant repurchase, that is – that's just when there are disconnects between where the shares are pricing and
where the warrants are pricing. We think that there may be opportunities to buy those warrants, and so we evaluate that
from time to time. And when we see those opportunities, then we'll execute on the warrant repurchase.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. Thank you very much, guys.

And the next question is from John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, John. How are you doing?
<Q - John Edwards>: Doing well. Good afternoon. Just question for Steve. So on Northeast Direct, you indicated
you've moved, I guess, two-thirds of it now to the backlog, but if memory serves, your – the amount of commitments
you've secured are about the same as it was last quarter. So I'm just – help me understand better what changed that
you're able to sort of move that to backlog, and you're in position to move forward with it?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. No. That's right, John. And it's really three things. One is, those contracts, we've
developed greater confidence around them as they're starting through their LDC approval process.
Secondly, we looked hard at the project and as we were phasing the capacity in, sort of where would we have unsold
capacity and what do we think we could do with that capacity? What value could we attribute to it? That's not under
contract. That's based on our judgment that, because the demand is there and it's growing, that we're going to be able to
market some of that unsold capacity. We'll still be trying to actively sell it, of course, long term, but we'll have good
economic opportunities on some of the unsold capacity, particularly during the wintertime. So we put that into our
expectations.
And then finally, just the overwhelming need for the project overall, the demand and, frankly, we think that getting out
there with our customers, telling them that we are going forward, is going to help in the additional sign-ups that we
need. It helps us get through the approval process. It helps us make the project concrete for the people who we want to

get concrete with us, in terms of signing up for a long-term commitment. So those are the things that improved our
confidence quarter-over-quarter.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. And then how did you factor in on the major competing projects there into this calculus?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. We have our eyes on our own homework here basically. We're trying to fill this thing up
with commitments, and whether the other guys get theirs done or not, we're just – we're kind of tunnel vision on this.
We're just focusing on our deals and getting those in. We think we have a very good project and that that project is
properly located and sized to serve New England markets and to attract our share, if you want to call it that, but
certainly the most accessible power demand to that footprint. And so we have no commentary here at all on what that
means about the other guy's project. We're fighting for this like it's a one-project deal, and we'll continue to do so.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay, that's helpful. And just on the backlog, it did increase substantially, and congrats on that.
I guess is it – did it move – how was that relative to your expectations? I mean, higher or lower, I guess, if you can give
any color on that.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It depends on the timeframe that you would look at it from. If you asked at the end of last
quarter, it's higher than I would have expected. If you'd have asked me last week, it's lower [indiscernible] (47:40).
We're not going to do anything uneconomic just to put something in the backlog. We're negotiating on a couple of other
things, and we think we'll get them done. And if and when we do, we'll get them out there. But I – look, we're – I'm
personally pleased with this addition for this quarter. I think this is very strong, particularly when you look at the
overall market out there.
<Q - John Edwards>: So then if you [ph] can (48:12) talk a little bit about – so relative to the overall market given the
pretty sloppy commodity conditions we're in, you'd indicated you thought if commodity prices were a lot higher, that
obviously you thought the backlog would be a lot higher, and so just – I'm trying to get a sense for how – what the
opportunity set more broadly is looking like from your perspective, if you can give any commentary on that front.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. Well, let me jump in there, John. The truth of it is that we're damn pleased with
having a $22 billion backlog in this kind of environment, number one.
Number two, we have a heck of a lot more opportunities out there and it's a reflection of the fact that we have just a
very good footprint spanning North America. And so we're going to continue to look at all of these. Steve's absolutely
right, we have some more opportunities that are pretty close to getting the horse in the corral and we hope to get in and
put the saddle on it shortly, and when we do we'll advise you of it. And we've got a lot of other potential here, but we're
doing really well on the backlog, and I think to predict exactly where we're going to be in one quarter or two quarters is
a fool's errand. But we're very pleased with where we are and what we have out in front of us.
<Q - John Edwards>: That's actually really helpful. I mean I'm just trying to get a sense for sort of maybe more
broadly, the industry conditions, but that's very helpful. That's all I had for now, but thank you very much.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Thank you.

And the next question is from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Darren, how are you?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Hey, fine. Thanks, Rich. Hope you and everyone are doing well. Just one question for me
on UMTP and I realize you're involved in the open season until September so, Steve, as you said, [ph] the silence
(50:11) continues.
But with respect to all the recently proposed acquisitions and volatility across all the NGL dynamics [indiscernible]
(50:20) price expectations in the Northeast, how do you guys think about Northeast NGL supply-and-demand balance?

How you think it could change? And more importantly, to what extent does that influence your thoughts, either on
scale or scope of the project or maybe even downstream market demand for batched NGL service on UMTP?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. Yeah, so a few things there. I mean, one is, again, commodity prices do dampen the
enthusiasm for making long term – lower commodity prices dampen the enthusiasm for making longer-term
commitment by the producers. But having said that the long-term outlook, we think, for NGL production out of that
region is very robust and there are producers who are focused on that and realize that for their net-backs to be
attractive, they need to have an outlet, and they probably need to have multiple outlets or have options.
And we think having the option to access essentially the capital of the Northeast, or of the U.S. NGL market in Mont
Belvieu, as well as the heart of petchem demand along the Gulf Coast here, as well as access to export docks. So that's
pretty attractive and so the people who are thinking about it longer term are going to be attracted to it.
But there were a couple of modifications that we made to help improve our chances. You alluded to one of them. You
know the batch system that makes us really not a competitor with the local fractionators, we can still move Y-grade,
that's one of the options. But we can move purity products and just having the ability to batch different products adds
options and therefore adds value to the outlook for producers associated with the project.
The second thing is, quite frankly, we started working on the market side of this, and Ron McClain and his team have
been talking to international off-takers who have a different timeframe and perspective that they bring to the table, and
so we're branching out, outside of just the traditional producing community and trying to find a way to [ph] couple
(52:36) this together by focusing on the demand side as well – the market end of it as well. So we continue to believe
that we have a good project.
We've been here before. This is not our first open season. So we're not putting in the backlog and not promising success
here, but it's also not costing us a lot to maintain this option, and we have the ability to, as we've said before, keep it in
gas service and make it part of an additional southbound haul. So we're going to keep working on it because we believe
in it, and we're going to keep trying to make it better and get people to sign up for long-term commitments.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Thanks, Steve.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: [ph] I would add, too (53:13), there's been a lot of preliminary interest in the open season
and a lot of people that signed CAs, and so we think the interest is there, and a lot of that's triggered by the batching
ability and the multiple destination and origin points. So, [indiscernible] (53:27).

And the next question is from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Brandon. How are you?
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: I am good. How are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: This will be a short one, but I just wanted to tag on the back of Darren's question on
UMTP. Is this part of the natural progression of the open season? Or was there a catalyst in quarter that kind of [ph]
tipped (53:55) the balance to get you guys to go ahead and do an open season? In particular, I'm wondering if kind of
the spread on the percent realization in NGLs to crude helped kind of spark interest on the end market perspective.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No, not really any, call it, short-term spread difference. It was really – kind of the progression
here was Ron's team re-conceived the project a bit in terms of the batch system and then spent a lot of time on the
international or on the demand side, let's call it, and developed that a bit, and then we spent some more time with
producers. And so it was just kind of the natural next step after having kind of been out there socializing with
everybody what the new configuration looked like and trying to figure out the right destinations and the right receipt

points. It was just the natural next step.
We often go out in open season with an anchor shipper and a pretty high probability, pretty high confidence level of
success. I wouldn't call this open season one of those. We are out there in the marketing effort right now. We're going
to see if we can get it done, but it's not a seated or anchored open season the way some of ours are.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay, great, perfect color on that. Almost could be in a half of incremental term, gas
capacity signed up in the quarter. I would call that impressive. As you look forward, is that going to be a high
watermark [ph] for the (55:29) next few quarters? Or is there – have been in the hopper, so to speak, that looks equally
as good?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: [ph] Tom (55:38), you want to comment on that?
<A>: That's a big quarter. Yeah, but I think we'll do more before the end of the year. I think [ph] that would be to
(55:46) probably another fee by the end of the year. It's very possible.

And the next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Jeremy.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to go back to the topic of M&A for a minute, if you could. Just
wondering if you could comment at all, if you – in the market out there, if you see producers with midstream assets
versus entry-level consolidation, is there – what's more attractive on either side of that? And also, how much are you
guys looking outside of the U.S. at the point, in Canada or other jurisdictions? Do you see opportunities there as well?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Dax?
<A - Dax A. Sanders>: Yeah. I would say that there are certainly some producers out there with assets. I would say
that [ph] there (56:41) probably is not necessarily the catalyst right now with certain of those producers that may have
existed with certain people earlier this year. But there are certainly some producers that have assets.
To the earlier conversation, I think there still exists certain bid offer spreads between what those producers'
expectations for those assets are, whether it's valuation or control of those types of things and what people are willing
to pay. But you are seeing certain of those deals getting done. I think you may see a few more here and there, but those
are still available.
With respect to international assets, I think what we've said in the past, certainly the consolidation we did last year, as
we've said repeatedly, makes it easier, [indiscernible] (57:25) some various threats to deploy capital internationally now
I would say that we have. So it's certainly easier for us to do them than it has been in the past. We certainly don't have
mandates to deploy capital internationally, but I think we're probably – there are fewer barriers and we're probably
more open to it than we have been in the past. But we're certainly cognizant of [ph] the sovereign risks (57:48) and it
would have to be – it has to present some really good risk-adjusted returns for us to do it. And Western Canada is
obviously a place where we have quite a bit of infrastructure and got very high opinion of them, so.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: And just to add on a little bit more there, in Mexico, there's a lot of activity there. I don't – I
mean, there's a lot of infrastructure going up to the border, but just wondering as far as your appetite of moving into
Mexico and if that would be something of interest to you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, we'll look at all opportunities. It depends on the return-risk ratio. But again, the point
you're making is important. No matter who builds the lines in Mexico, we stand to benefit from them because we have
such a structure just across the border, whether in Texas or Arizona or [ph] either (58:39) Southern California. So I
think we'd benefit, but we would not rule out doing something there, but it had to be under the right terms and

<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. Thanks. And then just one more. Commodity prices have been volatile and have
recently shown weakness and I'm just wondering if you could share any thoughts that you guys have internally and
where prices might go? And more importantly, just refresh us on your hedging philosophy?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: You want to add our view to your collection? Is that it? First of all, we have maintained
discipline around our hedging policy, even when you don't necessarily like the prices you're seeing. Jesse and his team
have continued to layer on the hedges and even in this commodity price environment.
I think you have to – there's a lot of near-term bearishness certainly across – particularly across the liquids parts of the
commodity portfolio. But I think longer term, I think the future is brighter for those as we see additional demand pick
up, but look, it's so hard to call, particularly, oil has all the geopolitical factors that you'd have to have a crystal ball to
try to predict. But I think fundamentally, you would believe there to be long-term upside in those commodity prices,
but maybe not this year.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Got you. And so no changing to your hedging policy? I mean, you guys are still active in
future years?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: That's correct.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

And the next question is from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Hi. Good afternoon. I was wondering what was driving your thinking was in this commodity
environment where there was maybe another $1 million, if I heard correctly, in additional EOR CapEx that hit the
pipeline? And I was also curious if some more color to be given on some of the smaller fields that this quarter, though,
still behind budget seem to be picking up a little?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. On the EOR front, I mean, Jesse can fill in here, but what we've done is we've added
some additional investment, which is really part of the program that we had anticipated all along on our Tall Cotton or
residual oil zone recovery. That's the bulk of what we're adding to the backlog. We did an assessment of this really, I
guess, last quarter to look at what are the returns in the current commodity price environment, really looking at it at
$50, $60, $40 and $70 kind of dollar range. And between $50 and $60, these projects are very attractive returns, and
even better when you take into account even a modest assumption around cost reductions of say 15%, which Jesse and
his team are doing better than that right now. So these projects are economic, and we will pursue them so long as they
are.
And I'm sorry, the second part of your question, Craig, was...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Production and cap and [ph] ultimate (1:02:10)...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: And what about it...?
<A>: [ph] You said it was up (1:02:12)?
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Goldsmith seemed to be picking up a little more. I mean, I know Katz and Goldsmith are
behind, but if there's – it seems like there may be [ph] perking (1:02:22) up a little bit, and if there's any kind of update
that you could give.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: [indiscernible] (1:02:26) I think we need to ask Jesse who heads up our CO2 operation.
We're very pleased; Goldsmith particularly is up 20% quarter-over-quarter. So, Jesse, you want to comment on that?

<A - Jesse Arenivas>: Yeah, I think we've seen a lot of improvement in Goldsmith. It's primarily on our
implementation of surveillance and facility optimization projects, able to withdraw more fluid, which was [ph] a hold
back (1:02:48) on production. So I think we're currently [ph] averaging (1:02:52) in that 1,900 barrels a day, which is
almost double what it was this time last year. So seeing a lot of improvement, well operating costs are coming down.
We're finding efficient methods to move fluid. But overall, we're pleased. We've come a long way [indiscernible]
(1:03:08).
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And a bit of a follow-up maybe to Christine's question on industry M&A. To a degree –
I know that historically you all normally don't pursue aggressive M&A, either in terms of paying a lot or hostile. But if
large peers are putting themselves up, do you see absolute regulatory issues barring you from participating, or is that
something that you can really sharpen the pencil on to determine if maybe some individual large assets are better
placed somewhere else, but you can still participate in that process?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That would have to be determined on a case-by-case basis looking at the exact assets
involved and whether there is or [ph] is an overlap (1:04:09) with our footprint, but we would never rule anything out
and certainly think we'd study very carefully anything that came to fruition.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: And last question. Rich, you said that there were attractive returns given the 20-year guarantee
by Shell on that $630 million of additional investment. Is there roughly a broad range of EBITDA on that project you
could offer at Elba?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I don't have an EBITDA number off the top of my head. I think...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: But it's consistent with how we would price other projects.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Right.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And that's a long-term credit from an A-rated credit.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. Thank you.

And the next question is from Peter Levinson of Waveny Capital. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Peter.
<Q - Peter Levinson>: Hey, guys. How are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Peter Levinson>: Question I guess is for Rich and Steve. It seems to us that, in the last, call it, six weeks to eight
weeks, your stock has been beaten up for four reasons: one, rates, fear of rates, rate hikes from the Fed, et cetera. If we
spot that the Fed is going to start to raise rates gradually, it still doesn't seem to explain the move in your stock, because
you're trading at historical wides and you're trading much wider to your comps than you have historically.
Two, crude being down on Iran coming online, OPEC, et cetera, but you guys have given us the math. You've
demonstrated that you're not meaningfully exposed to the crude price. Three, the timely or untimely resurrection of
what I thought was a wholly discredited bear attack by a tabloid claiming that your investment-grade debt is not
serviceable. And four, your retirement, but you're showing us that you remain actively involved. You've been buying
stock in the open market. You're leading this call.
I'm struggling to understand. Until, call it two weeks ago, you and Williams traded exactly in line on a dividend yield
basis. They got a bid at a 33% premium, your stock trades down. What am I missing?

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: You tell me. It goes without saying you guys listen to me, I'm the largest shareholder, and I
don't like it a bit. What's the old saying, I'd mad as hell and I won't take it anymore, but I can't use the latter part of that,
obviously. No, I think in the long run, markets are rational. In the short term, they can be irrational. If you look at it,
we've looked at it every way but Sunday – from Sunday. Through the first quarter, we outperformed most of our peers.
We fell off in the second quarter. And if you look at it back through October, when oil was last at $90, we've done
pretty well compared with the peers. We're very disappointed with the performance over the last few weeks. Some of
us had bought more stock. That's the only good thing, it's a buying opportunity. And we just don't see it. All the points
you make are interesting.
Certainly, I don't think my retirement has anything to do with this. I am still around. My name's on the door. Steve and
Kim and the rest of this team can run it a hell of a lot better than I can anyway. So that should not be and is not, in my
opinion, a factor.
But certainly, rates are, and any time you have bear attacks, I suppose that has some modest impact anyway. But I am
hopeful that, after what we've said today, and you can see this growth in the backlog and the fact that – I'll never say, as
Steve said, that we're unaffected. As he said, sure, we have effect against us if our customers are suffering with low
commodity prices. But in general, we're pretty oblivious to this. We're pretty able to prop up and produce very nice
cash flow regardless of where the commodity prices are.
And to me, that's what makes this a great story. When you're out there saying we're paying a 5% dividend and we're
giving you 10% growth for the next six years, that to me is just a wonderful story, based on $130 billion of enterprise
value. So we're very disappointed in the price, so thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment on it.
<Q - Peter Levinson>: Okay. Thanks very much, and congrats on a great quarter.

And the next question is from Becca Followill of U.S. Capital. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Becca. How are you?
<Q - Becca Followill>: I'm good. Thanks. On the $600 million project that you're deferring in Q2, can you talk about
what that is?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. It's primarily – it's not exclusively, but primarily it is additional CO2 source
development. And it's really two things: One is that part of the source development that we're continuing with at Doe
Canyon, we found a much more economic way to get the same amount of production. It essentially involves – we didn't
have to build a whole new set of facilities. We can use an existing set of facilities to accomplish what we want out
there. So we were able to take some scope out of the project. But the rest of it, and the majority of it really, is that we
think we can scale back the addition of additional CO2 source and still meet the demand that we expect for the market
for the near term, so during the period of the backlog. So we still see growth in that CO2 demand, just not as much as it
was before. Jesse, anything else?
<Q - Becca Followill>: So none of it's reduced drilling or development of your – infield development?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It's not reduced...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: It's all on the forward gas side.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. It's on the – yeah. And so we're drilling on both ends of this thing, right? So the EOR, it's
not a representation of reduced activity in the enhanced oil recovery fields; it's on the development of CO2 production
that we send down the pipe and send to third parties and our operations.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. Thank you. And then, just to clarify on Elba Liquefaction, I think, just based on your
analyst meeting, the original CapEx there was $884 million for your 51%. And then you're seeing additional $630

million, gives us a total of $2.1 billion. Can you help me reconcile that difference?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think the $885 million just pertained to our share of the plant itself, and we have other
ancillary facilities that we are building as part of this, and we're getting paid for.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: So think of Elba as kind of two pieces with a third related piece. One is the liquefaction facility
itself. That was the JV, okay. That was the 51/49 JV. The other is the Elba terminalling facilities itself, which were
always 100% Kinder Morgan. And then the third related piece is the transportation, the upstream gas pipeline
transportation that brings the gas into the facility, some of which is being done for Shell, but some of it is being done
for third parties as well, and that's 100% Kinder Morgan.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay, great. And then, to clarify just on the product pipelines, did you guys restate the way
you're showing volumes there?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Oh. Is that – did we adjust for the JV? We may – yes, Becca, we would have adjusted
both periods. There were some cases where we were showing JVs at 100%.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And so we've gone through our pro rata share on those JVs and it's an apples-to-apples
comparison, meaning we adjusted the prior period and this period.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay, got you. And then do you have a new estimate of CapEx, excluding acquisitions, for
2015? The original was $4.4 billion. There's been new productions in CO2, plus some additions there. Is that $4.4
billion still ballpark? Or are we looking at lower than that?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We are looking at [indiscernible] (1:12:38) so the original $4.4 billion included a little
over $300 million in acquisitions. And so the $4.4 billion is now $7 billion, again, including acquisitions, Hiland and
stuff. So on the original budget of $4.0 billion really, or $4.04 billion expansion CapEx, and that number is now $3.6
billion of the $7 billion is associated with expansion CapEx, so about a $430 million reduction. And that is, it's got a lot
of moving parts in it, but the biggest piece of that is roughly the $450 million reduction that I talked about in CO2,
primarily associated with the S&P development at St. Johns and the Lobos Pipe.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay, perfect. And then last question on Northeast Direct. With capacity of 1.3 Bcf a day [ph]
contracted $5.50 (1:13:41), I know you said you're comfortable [ph] with (1:13:42) picking up volumes maybe,
especially in the winter, but how do you phase this in? If you don't get any contracts, do you go forward with the –
additional contracts, do you go forward with the full 1.3 Bcf, assuming it's only 42% contracted, or do you – how do
you phase it in so that you could maybe not be so under-contracted?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, good question. So we get the pipe laid, the compression additions can be separate
decisions. And so when I talked about us being able to phase in as the commitments come in, we're going to ask to
authorize the whole thing, okay? But we will be able to make decisions on individual compressor – compression
additions, compression capacity additions, as the commitments come through.
<A - Dax A. Sanders>: Yeah. So I mean – just to, I guess, repeat what Steve and Rich said earlier, we're really kicking
off the project for 600,000 cf a day, but certainly with the compression expansions, we can scale that up as we get
additional firm commitments, up to the 1.3 Bcf, and that won't affect the original – the timing of serving of [ph]
regional (1:14:50) customers, because they are just compression expansions.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. It helps a lot. And then finally on UMTP, with no storage or underground storage
up in the area, is that a big chunk of the $4 billion price tag? Having to build above-ground storage in order to run the
system?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We do have some storage additions included in the project. Ron, do you want to cover that?
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: We have some storage on the north end planned, and we're looking at storage options on
the south end. I don't believe they're included if that gets back to where the shipper wants to go with product, whether

it's [ph] Kim (1:15:30) or refining or international. I think the big part of it is utilizing the dock potential on the south
end, but we do have some [ph] tentative (1:15:40) plans in the – to coordinate you have to buffer your product and the
batch line, so some products come in, others are building inventory and eventually you clear them, so there's
operational storage plans.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. And then, I'm sorry I had one more. On Palmetto, how do you guys proceed
without having that permit from Georgia?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, as I've said, the permit was not required for us to proceed with the project. It would've
been helpful to the project. And I don't want to go into a lot of detail here. We're really exploring the options for how
we nevertheless proceed with the project, but don't want to go into a lot of detail here for competitive reasons.

And the next question is from Ross Payne with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Mr. Payne, how are you doing?
<Q - Ross Payne>: I'm doing fine, Rich. How are you doing?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Ross Payne>: A follow-on question to that, I mean, I assume the Palmetto was going to bring additional volumes
for Elba Island to export, so I was going to ask you to...
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: No, it's not.
<Q - Ross Payne>: Is that the [ph] right thinking (1:16:54) or not? Okay.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, different products. So Palmetto is a refined – is gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. And of
course, LNG on...
<Q - Ross Payne>: Okay. My bad on that. So with the Georgia situation, I mean, I guess you've given about as much
information as you can, but do you – in terms of your confidence level on being able to move forward with that, how
would you gauge that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We're still confident enough to put it in the back – or leave it in the backlog, rather. It was
already in the backlog, which is a reflection that we remain – we believe that it's a highly probable project.
<Q - Ross Payne>: Okay. And then if you guys could give us a little bit of an update on where you are in your hedges
just for the rest of the year? And then maybe looking out into 2016 in terms of percentage of expected production that
you're hedged, and perhaps the level?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah. On 2015, the balance of 2015, we're hedged at 81% at $78. In 2016, we're hedged
at 58% at $75; 2017 at 36% at $75; 2018 is 27% at $75; and 2019 is 12% at $56.
<Q - Ross Payne>: Okay. Thank you, Kim, very much. And then one of the rating agencies recently [ph] worked
(1:18:23) you guys up and kind of inferred that there could be some M&A that's outside of your typical business. If you
guys can kind of talk about what that might look like and just kind of expand on that a little bit if you can?

<A>: Yeah. I think he's referring to – Ross, I think you're referring to annuities, right, that's where we talk about the
potential need to reach outside of our typical, traditional field of investments. And I think you referenced the Jones Act
tankers, which we're very happy with that acquisition, supported by long-term contracts.
<Q - Ross Payne>: Right. And I just didn't know if there was going to be anything out – beyond that box that we've
typically seen with you guys. And obviously, Jones Act kind of pushed it out a little bit, but you could almost call that a
moving pipeline. But do you guys envision getting into any other assets outside of the typical energy assets that you...
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, look, Ross, as we've said many times we look at ourselves as a toll road, and that toll
road is a pipeline, which is certainly our field of greatest expertise and where the majority of our assets are. That's
great. If it moves by rail, we're pretty big in rail terminals. If it moves by ship, we have Jones Act tankers. So we look
at all these things so that we can do, as long as it's in the energy field and as long as we're acting as a toll road and can
lock up as much of the cash flow as humanly possible. And that's why these Jones Act tankers have been so good;
we've been able to enter into long-term contracts with very credit-worthy shippers.
So we'll continue to look for opportunities like that. We aren't going to go out and buy a bakery, although I'm glad [ph]
Hostess cupcakes (1:20:17) are doing so well. But we're sticking to what we know.

And the next question is from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Faisal. How are you?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it. Just a couple questions, just going back to I think
somebody else's question on the Product Pipelines, the throughput volumes there. Just wanted to make sure I'm
understanding this correctly, so it looks like gasoline volumes sequentially dropped off pretty significantly, although
they were up year-over-year. Just wanted to make sure I understand how those numbers move around. Obviously,
profits were up sequentially and up over last year, but I just want to make sure I understand how the seasonality works
on the product pipelines.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, I guess I'm a little confused on that. Our total [ph] revised (1:21:15) products were
159,000, really 160,000 or million barrels this time versus [ph] 304 million barrels (1:21:23) year-to-date, which would
mean it's actually up second quarter over first quarter, just eyeballing it.
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: That's correct, especially in gas.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. So I must be looking at different data then, I'm looking at 110 million barrels in the first
quarter down to 98 million barrels. So I must be pulling different data then, that's my bad.
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: And we're up 4% overall on refined products. A lot of that's on the West Coast and
Pacific. We think lower commodity prices [indiscernible] (1:21:51), more demand, and there's also some recovery of
economy. So we're really enjoying that on both coasts, so...
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. So, the volumes are definitely up sequentially on the Product Pipelines?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. And I'm just looking at, I think it's the same numbers that – well, from the release here.
And our three months is more than half of the year-to-date. We're up...
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Okay. Got you. I'm just reading the data wrong then. Sorry about that.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: As gasoline demand grows as you go into the summer months [indiscernible] (1:22:22).

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: If you look around here and as Ron McClain was pointing out is that these lower prices, if
they have any advantage, we are starting to see this as I guess a third quarter or fourth quarter in a row where we've
seen improvement quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. And so that's encouraging, that it looks like maybe lower
prices are having some impact on how much people are driving them.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And you might look at your – if you're looking at last quarter's press release, you might
look at just this one and do the comparative data. Plantation may have been adjusted, too, with our share of Plantation.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Again, [indiscernible] (1:23;01)...
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: That's what we did. We...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: For both...
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Okay. That's what we have – yeah.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: ...periods we had this press release, but if you were looking at a prior one it might have
that issue.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Right, right.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Okay. And that's what we must be getting wrong. Okay. Thank you for clearing that up.
<A>: It's up dramatically at 282% quarter-over-quarter. A lot of that's because of acquisition and tremendous growth,
okay? But that's a big [ph] adder (1:23:21) and the product was.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood. And then just a couple questions on potential sort of enhancements or
expansions of your current asset base, is there a way for you to make a significant investment in the LPG export
market, given the terminals you guys control around the country? How are you guys looking at that opportunity,
vis-à-vis the demand from customers?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. We are looking at – we have a great position on the Houston Ship Channel, a number of
facilities, as you know, up and down the channel. And we have been looking at opportunities for export facilities. And
we don't have anything done yet, but [ph] low there (1:24:05) on the East Coast. And on the [indiscernible] (1:24:08).
Go ahead, [ph] John (1:24:10).
<A>: There are a number of opportunities to present themselves. We're looking at LPG, both in Houston and the
Northeast, but it's competing with [ph] clean (1:24:19) product projects that we're looking at the same facilities, as well
as potential crude projects. So the market is very ripe in Houston right now. It's just a matter of which product makes
the most sense on a going-forward basis.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Understand. And if you think about those different options, and what's the most
profitable barrel to ship? Is it gasoline and diesel, or is it LPG?
<A>: Well our experience on the Houston Ship Channel is 43 million barrels of gasoline and diesel. And we've had a
tremendous amount of success on that, and we have a number of projects to continue to grow and expand that. We've
gone 4 four docks to 12 docks, gasoline and diesel are both seeing a resurgence on the export side. So we'll see more
and more opportunities there. The LPG projects are very profitable, so they could compete with potential – in other
expansions. But we see more and more opportunities on the clean side, more so than the other two.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And just going back to the question someone asked about what kind of assets would you
own any other assets outside of the normal footprint you've sort of been in, would you ever buy a railroad company?

<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think it's – as Rich said, what we're looking for is secure cash flows and particularly, secure
and growing cash flows. And so, you couldn't say that that was off the table. There may be opportunities like that, but
as you know, that's an extremely concentrated industry and we have done well, I think, with our investment in Watco,
and that's about, I think, all there is to say on it.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Understood. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it.
