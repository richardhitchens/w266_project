Robert A. Niblock
Good morning and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. We delivered comparable sales growth of 0.9% for the quarter,
driven primarily by an increase in comp average ticket. While prolonged winter weather exerted pressure on our
business, our enhanced sales and operations planning process, along with our distribution infrastructure allowed us to

align resources such as inventory, staffing and marketing more effectively by climatic zone.
In the South and West, where weather was more favorable, comps were in the mid single digits. The Northeastern part
of the country which was the most impacted by poor weather conditions during the quarter, experienced negative
comps and some of these regions faced additional headwinds from last year's Superstorm Sandy recovery activity.
For the quarter, seven of our 12 product categories had positive comps. Overall, indoor products which accounted for
roughly 65% of sales, had solid performance with positive comps of approximately 2%. In fact, in areas of the country
where weather was more cooperative, indoor comps were mid single will digits; however, outdoor products declined
approximately 1.5% overall.
We continue to see strength in our pro services business, which outperformed the company average during the quarter,
and I'm pleased to share that our team in Canada delivered double digit comps in local currency for the fourth
consecutive quarter.
We remain focused on improving our profitability, even while investing in key capabilities to drive sales growth. For
the quarter, gross margin expanded 70 basis points, driven by a number of factors that Bob will discuss.
Additionally, we effectively controlled expenses in the quarter and delivered earnings per share of $0.61, which
included unfavorable charges related to long-lived asset impairments and favorable impact of a lower tax rate for the
quarter, for a net benefit of $0.03 per share.
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter we repurchased $850 million of
stock and paid $186 million in dividends.
Moving on to the economic landscape for the remainder of 2014. The backdrop for home improvement industry growth
remains positive, despite the slow start to spring. Economic forecast still suggest a moderate improvement in growth
for the year.
Growth in key indicators such as employment, income, and consumer spending have recently begun to improve from
weather affected levels earlier in the year. Although signals from the housing market are mixed with existing home
sales declining in recent months, while home values continue to increase, we believe stronger job and income growth
and gradually loosening credit conditions indicate that the environment for home improvement spending should remain
favorable.
These macroeconomic data points align with our first quarter consumer sentiment survey. According to the survey,
homeowners increasingly believe that improvements made to their homes will increase their value, and consumers'
views around personal finances continue to improve, as homeowners report that they are less likely to decrease home
improvement spending.
With these factors in mind, we believe underlying home improvement industry demand remains intact, despite
pressures exerted by unfavorable weather in the first quarter. In fact, performance has already improved in May, and
continued improvement in the macroeconomic landscape and the consumer sentiment, together with our strengthening
execution, strategic priorities and keen focus on productivity and flow-through continue to give us confidence in our
business outlook for 2014.
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to highlight a couple of recent organizational changes. At the end of April,
Greg Bridgeford retired from Lowe's after providing 32 years of world-class service to the organization. Succeeding
Greg as Chief Customer Officer is Mike Jones, who previously served as Chief Merchandising Officer.
Mike brings extensive leadership experience, expertise in key product categories and a clear focus on the customer. In
his new role, Mike will be responsible for creating experiences that better serve customers and differentiate us from our
competitors. He will oversee U.S. home improvement strategy and customer experience design, merchandising, and
marketing and communications.

Filling the Chief Merchandising Officer role is Mike McDermott. Mike has more than 20 years of experience in leading
global product management and merchandising teams and in driving innovation.
Mike McDermott will ensure continued refinement of our improved line review product reset process now that value
improvement has been rolled into our base operations. And he will continue the efforts he started as General
Merchandising Manager of Building and Maintenance to ensure that we have the products and the brands pro
customers demand.
Lastly, Mike Mabry has been named U.S. Home Improvement Strategy and Experience Design Executive. He will
oversee our efforts to satisfy customers' needs with a seamless omni-channel offering, and to differentiate with better
customer experiences than any other home improvement provider. Both Mike Mabry and Mike McDermott report to
Mike Jones.
I look forward to the continued contribution from our more than 260,000 employees and would like to thank them for
their dedication to serving customers, and for their efforts to continue building on the momentum established in 2013 as
we further transform our business model. Thanks again for your interest, and with that, let me turn the call over to
Mike.
Michael A. Jones
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. We executed well during the quarter, despite unexpected prolonged
winter in many areas of the country. While we saw reduced demand for many outdoor products, we bolstered
performance in our seasonal categories by helping customers dig out from snow and ice, as we positioned truckloads of
weather-relevant products at our regional distribution centers, which enabled quick deliveries to our stores in areas
hardest hit by winter weather.
We also offered customers a new outdoor living experience that inspired them to buy patio furniture and accessories,
even when the weather didn't cooperate in parts of the country. I'll share more on this experience in a few minutes.
In rough plumbing and electrical, we generated strong sales by providing ample supplies of products customers needed
to repair pipes damaged by the severe cold, as well as prepared their HVAC systems for spring.
Moving to interior projects. We drove strong sales in fashion fixtures where we saw a particular strength in light bulbs,
driven by LED and other energy efficient products and in fashion plumbing products such as bath faucets, vanities and
toilets. We are providing compelling new styles and coordinated sets for customers refreshing or remodeling their
bathrooms, and our in-home project specialists are simplifying the process by guiding customers through inspiration,
design, and installation.
We continue to drive solid performance in kitchen and appliances, where expansive offering of major brands, along
with service advantages of next day delivery and haul away, and in-house facilitation of repairs and maintenance,
provides a best-in-class customer experience.
We also drove solid performance within tools and hardware. Particularly, in power tools, where our lineup of Bosch
handheld power tools and accessories performed very well. We are focused this year on three priorities to drive further
top-line growth: using our enhanced sales and operations planning process to optimize performance in micro-seasons
by market, improving our product and service offering for the pro customer, and building customer experience design
capabilities.
Through our enhanced sales and operations planning process, we have addressed an opportunity to improve seasonal
planning, including the cadence of inventory allocation, staffing, associate training, and marketing. This quarter, this
process helped us drive ticket growth and support traffic against an unfavorable weather backdrop.
The theme for this year's spring plan was Spring is Calling! It didn't call as early as we initially expected, but when it
did, we were well prepared, and where it did, we performed well. We build plans by climatic zones in order to get the
most from our investments in inventory, staffing and marketing.

For instance, we staggered our spring Black Friday campaigns. The earliest rollout occurred in the Deep South in
mid-March, and the last rollout took place in the North just at the beginning of May. All occurred at appropriate times
for each geography, when customers plan to clean and prep their outdoor spaces for enjoyment throughout the spring,
summer and fall.
Our second area of focus is to better capitalize on the pro market, which is growing faster than the consumer market. So
we are enhancing our product and service offering for this important customer. While pros shop across the entire store,
the penetration of sales to pro customers is highest within traditional building and maintenance categories, including
lumber and building materials, mill work, rough plumbing and electrical, and tools and hardware.
So we have grouped these building and maintenance categories together to focus on ensuring we have the types of
products and brands pros demand. For example, the mix of customers shopping electrical wire is roughly 70% pro and
30% DIY. We were losing share in this core category, particularly with electricians. So within last year's line review,
we focused on why and what we needed to change.
We identified pro purchased fibers by obtaining insights from our vendors and surveying our dedicated pro sales team.
We then validated our initial findings with pro customers. We found that while we have opportunity to enhance our
offering for pros working on residential jobs, we had an even greater opportunity to enhance our offering for pros
working on commercial jobs. In the end, we added to our selection of wire types, gauges and colors, as well as full rolls
of wiring cable to supplement the offering of wire sold by the foot, along with contractor pack pricing, so pros could
benefit from buying bulk rolls.
We also launched our new hand tools from Southwire, a brand electricians know and trust. Of course, winning the pros'
business also requires great service in an omni-channel environment to make doing business with us quick and
convenient. This quarter, we will relaunch LowesForPros.com, testing it with larger pro customers before rolling it out
more broadly. This relaunch will provide a dedicated platform for pro customers to purchase online from Lowe's, in
addition to align pros to access contract pricing, develop requisition lists, and view purchase history. And
LowesForPros will be enabled for convenient mobile access.
Our third area of focus is developing a process to coordinate the elements of great customer experiences. To do this,
our dedicated customer experience design team is working with customers to better understand how they think about
specific home improvement projects, from planning, shopping and buying, to using and enjoying. And based on these
insights, this team is designing an entire experience from inspiration and product assortment, to purchase and
fulfillment.
That experience must meet three critical criteria. It must be desirable to our target customer. It must be feasible. In
other words, it must fit within our organization's competencies, and it must be viable. Something we can deliver in a
profitable and sustainable way.
An example of what can be accomplished with this approach is the outdoor living experience we rolled out to the
majority of our stores in advance of our key spring selling season. We started with research and determined that
customers shopping for outdoor living products rely mostly on in-store display for inspiration. Further, wide selection,
price, and coordination of patterns and colors, our customers' top shopping attribute, brand does not index as high for
this product category.
Customers are looking for inspiration as they seek to create an extension of their home and to use their outdoor space
during more of the year. They want to directly interact with the patio furniture to access its comfort and to envision
using it. And they want the ability to build a collection over time.
With these attributes in mind, we examined our previous outdoor living area and determined that customers could not
navigate easily through aisles filled with product and that coordinating products, colors and trends was more difficult
when they were not close to one another.
In short, we were selling isolated products, not helping customers build their outdoor room. We then used these insights
to evolve our outdoor living experience. In over two-thirds of our stores we removed 15 bays of steel racking to create

a showroom feel with about 35% more open space, which is made possible by our larger store format. To help
customers envision their outdoor space, we are displaying patio sets with coordinating rugs, umbrellas, and accessories
like pillows, lanterns and planters, along with grills and other outdoor products, just as you would expect in your own
backyard.
Customers can also customize their sets. Special orders can be delivered from distribution centers to stores in seven
days or less and coordination extends to Lowes.com. The customers can find style at every price point. In fact, this area
showcases several sets under $500. This new experience better positions Lowe's as a destination for outdoor living and
should drive sales to more improved close rate and attachment. In this case because we have a determined brand to be a
less important shopping attribute for outdoor living products, we can leverage our direct sourcing capability to buy
these high quality products at a competitive cost, which should benefit both sales and gross margin.
We are pleased with the performance of the outdoor living experience so far, as the year progresses, this space will
provide a flexible stage to display other seasonal products such as holiday decor.
Even while we are building customer experience design capabilities, our merchandising team continues to bring
exciting new products to Lowe's customers. For instance, we just recently introduced STAINMASTER PetProtect, an
exclusive in the home center channel. This carpet is made with a new fiber specifically designed to withstand the
toughest pet stains, reduce pet odor and lessen the time required to vacuum pet hair. In February, we became the
authorized dealer of Progress Lighting, whose interior lighting collection has the highest market share with pro
customers.
We are also excited about our recent rollout of Valspar Reserve, which will be our most technologically advanced paint
formulated with a new coloring system to increase durability, scrubbability and adhesion to challenging surfaces, and to
provide unparalleled hide and coverage. These are just a few examples of how we continue to work day in and day out
with our vendors to bring more innovation and value to customers, even while we work to better capitalize on the pro
market and differentiate through customer experience design.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's. I will now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull
Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $13.4 billion, an increase of 2.4% over last
year's first quarter. Total transaction count increased 2.9%, while average ticket decreased 0.5% to $64.68.
As previously discussed, the Orchard Supply stores have more transactions per square foot, but fewer per store and a
lower average ticket than a traditional Lowe's store. So while Orchard aided total sales by approximately 110 basis
points and it added roughly 240 basis points to our total transaction growth, it negatively impacted total average ticket
growth by approximately 130 basis points.
The Orchard stores are considered non-comp, but will be included in our comp sales calculation after the anniversary of
the acquisition in the third quarter of 2014. Comp sales were up 0.9%. Comp average ticket was up 0.8%, and comp
transactions were up one-tenth of 1%.
Looking at monthly trends, comps were essentially flat in February, 2.5% in March and flat in April. While the late
Easter holiday did not affect comps sales for the quarter it did impact the monthly spread. We estimate that normalizing
for the timing of Easter holiday, March and April comps would have been 0.8%, and 1.9%, respectively. We are
encouraged that both ticket and transactions adjusted for the Easter shift improved sequentially each month of the
quarter. This trend has continued into May.
Gross margin for the first quarter was 35.5% of sales, a 70 basis point increase over last year's first quarter. The
increase was driven primarily by value improvement and the mix of products sold. SG&A for Q1 was 24.76% of sales
which deleveraged 14 basis points. Employee insurance deleveraged 18 points primarily due to the Affordable Care
Act which drove a 10% increase in enrollment.

We incurred long-lived asset impairment expense of $23 million which resulted in 17 basis points of deleverage. These
items were somewhat offset by proprietary credit which leveraged 23 basis points due to continued growth in the
program and lower operating costs. Given the sales shortfall relative to our expectations we are pleased with our efforts
to manage the expenses in the quarter.
Depreciation for the quarter was $373 million, which was 2.78% of sales and deleveraged 9 basis points compared with
last year's first quarter as a result of the timing of information technology assets placed in service. For the year, we
expect depreciation expense to be essentially flat to last year.
Earnings before interest and taxes increased 47 basis points to 7.96% of sales. Interest expense at $124 billion for the
quarter deleveraged 7 basis points to last year as total debt increased approximately $1.1 billion versus last year.
Pre-tax earnings for the quarter were 7.03% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%, versus 37.8% for
Q1 last year. The lower tax rate, which aided earnings per share by $0.04 for the quarter relates primarily to a
settlement of prior year tax matters.
Earnings per share of $0.61 for the quarter represents a 24.5% increase over last year's $0.49. The $0.61 per share
includes both the $0.04 favorable tax rate impact and the negative $0.01 impairment impact.
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were
$658 million. Our first quarter inventory balance of $10.5 billion increased $241 million or 2.3% over Q1 last year. The
majority of the increase was driven by the addition of the Orchard Supply stores. Inventory turnover was 3.61 times, an
increase of 4 basis points over Q1 2013. Asset turnover increased 14 basis points to 1.59 times.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.1 billion represents a slight increase
over Q1 last year. The increase in accounts payable is lower than the 2.3% increase in inventory due to the timing of
purchases in the quarter versus last year. At the end of the quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDA was 2.14 times.
Return on invested capital increased 249 basis points for quarter to 12.02%.
Now, looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2 billion, capital expenditures were $194
million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.8 billion. In the quarter, we repurchased 17.9 million shares for $850 million
in the open market. We have approximately $5.4 billion remaining under share repurchase authorization. The
remaining $60 million of the $910 million shown on the statement of cash flows as repurchase of common stock relates
to shares repurchased from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities, as well as the timing of share
repurchase settlement across quarters.
Looking ahead, here's our business outlook. We believe that we'll recover the majority of the Q1 sales shortfall. As a
result, we have not adjusted our sales outlook for the year. We expect a total sales increase of approximately 5%,
driven by a comp sales increase of 4%, and the opening of approximately 10 big box stores and five Orchard Supply
locations. We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 65 basis points and expect the improvement will come from both
gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
After reflecting the favorable tax settlement from this quarter, the effective tax rate is expected to be 37.2% for the
year. Given the lower tax rate and Q1 impairment expense, we expect earnings per share of approximately $2.63 for the
year, versus our prior outlook of $2.60, which represents an increase of 22.9% over 2013.
We're forecasting cash flows from operations of approximately $4.1 billion. Our capital plan for 2014 is approximately
$1.2 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $2.9 billion for the year. We expect to issue incremental debt
during the year as we managed to the 2.25 times lease adjusted debt to EBITDA target. Our guidance assumes
approximately $3.4 billion in share repurchases for 2014, spent roughly evenly across the four quarters.
Carmen, we are now ready for questions.

[Operator instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Matthew Fassler, with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matt J. Fassler>: Thank you so much and good morning. My first question relates to sales, and my second
question or follow-up, if you will, relates to SG&A. Would it be possible for you, either to quantify the sales that you
think you lost to the weather in Q1, or talk about the first half versus second half sales relationship that you'd expect for
2014?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So Matt, we think the weather impacted our Q1 sales by approximately 150 basis points. About
35% of our sales are outdoor or mix related, so it had a pretty good impact on Q1. As we said in our prepared
comments, we do expect to recover the majority of that in the second quarter.
<Q - Matt J. Fassler>: Okay, and as we think about the base that you would add that to, should we think about the run
rate that you had in the non-weather impacted markets and then add a point and a half to that, or is that too simplistic of
a calculation?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Probably too simplistic since we've got tougher Q2 compares. As we indicated, our May is off
to a good start. We're running at about mid-single digit comp, driven by good balance of ticket and traffic. So we feel
good about the start to Q2 and our ability to recover lost sales from Q1.
<Q - Matt J. Fassler>: Great. And then on expenses, I just want to refer back to some of the color that I think you
gave us after Q4, about a couple of expense items that you [ph] didn't (28:08) reference. I think you originally expected
a bonus from retirement to deleverage for you a bit, and you had also called out a property tax – I'm sorry. A store
payroll item, in terms of significant leverage. Can you talk about what impact bonus accruals had on SG&A? And, if
it's possible, to quantify the labor levers that you had, it would be very helpful.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So Matt, a couple of items we talked about were risk insurance would be unfavorable because
of unfavorable – excuse me, to a favorable adjustment we had in Q1 2013. We actually experienced a favorable
adjustment this quarter as well, but that was somewhat offset by the impairment, higher utility and snow removal costs
associated with the weather. We did think that bonus was going to leverage – excuse me, deleverage in the quarter. It
actually provided some leverage. If you think about our experience in the first quarter, we missed our sales and
earnings plan. Our bonus plans are predicated on operating profitability, so the tax pick-up had no impact on the bonus
accruals. We did leverage bonuses about 9 basis points in the quarter.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of David Strasser, with Janney Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Thank you very much. Two questions. First of all, on the balance sheet, you had an
impairment charge that you tend to take them usually in Q4. You took it in Q1 of this year. Can you just give a little
background on where the impairment came from? And sort of why the timing of it?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Sure. So we've got a process to evaluate the profitability and viability of store locations. That
process occurs throughout the course of the year. There's a footnote in our 10-K that explains the process in some
detail, as we take a look at cash flows for the rolling 12 months to evaluate. There's no magic about what quarter that
trigger occurs and when impairment occurs. It does relate to two operating locations that just gave rise to the $23
million charge in Q1.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Fair, thanks. Back in February, Bob, you had made a comment that Q1 would be the best
comp of the year. Obviously, the weather kind of impacted that. As you kind of – and I'm asking Matt's question a little
bit differently, but as you kind of look at for the first half of the year, how substantial of a recovery do you need to
sustain in Q2 to hit your first half sales estimates? I mean, can you see a deceleration as that tough comp continues, the
tough comparison from last year continues through Q2, and still get to your first half plan, or is that kind of mid-single

that you talked about, a kind of number that you sort of need to hit?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yeah, so on the Q4 call, we talked about Q1 being our – coming into the year, we thought Q1
would be our best performing comp. Q2 would be our lowest performing comp, really based on compares relative to
2013. Obviously, weather is going to push some sales from Q1 to Q2. Q2 looks like it's going to be our highest
comping quarter at this point in time, even with tough compares. But having said that, the band between comp for Q2,
Q3 and Q4 is fairly narrow.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Chris Horvers, with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning. I was curious, your quarter ends on Sunday and Home
Depot's quarter ends on Friday. So we were out in the stores that weekend, and it was a pretty nice week on the East
Coast. So do you think that was some of the delta in the comp performance, because you probably had really – not a
great first weekend of February, weather-wise, and then you missed what looked like on the East Coast, the Northeast,
a pretty nice weekend, weather-wise, in the beginning of May.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, Chris, this is Robert. Actually, what you said was, we end on Friday and they end on
Sunday. So, maybe that's you meant, but I think you stated it backwards. But yeah, certainly, as you think about the
extent of the conversation that we've had so far today, weather was very difficult in the quarter. Certainly a pretty wide
spread. We've actually looked at the numbers and said, if we had adjusted and really looked at just the days that would
have picked up that last weekend, and dropped out the first weekend of the quarter, it would have made a difference on
our first quarter comps of about 50 basis points favorable.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Okay, about 50 basis points. And then two expense questions. One, I might have
missed it, but did you say anything about any negative impact in gross margin from proprietary credit? And then also,
on D&A, when you say flat year-over-year is that – I assume that's a dollar number.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So there was no negative impact. No significant impact to gross margin from the proprietary
credit program and the 5% off val-prop. As it relates to depreciation, we do expect dollars to be essentially flat to last
year; therefore, driving some leverage that contributes to the EBIT increase of 65 basis points for the year.

Your next question is from the line of Budd Bugatch, with Raymond James.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just a couple quick ones. Pro sales
penetration in the quarter, where was it as a percentage of sales, and where do you think it will wind up for the year
with your new pro programs?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Budd, this is Rick. We look at pros now as approximately 30% of our total mix of business,
and we continue to work on that daily. The thing that we really looked at pro, when you look at Q1, it was roughly
three times our comp number for the company. And I think we are getting some credit for the continued progress of the
initiative. When you look at the pros, they are reacting very strongly to our structure that we implemented last year of
in-store specialists to really manage and handle the customers when they come inside the stores. Our market account
specialists, which manages the larger accounts within the marketplace, and then our national accounts program, which
manages those accounts that do business across many stores across the country. That process and that program is
working extremely well.
Keep in mind, the investments that we made in the inventory, as well as the val-prop proprietary credit discounts that
we offer them to give them additional incentive, as well as our normal contractor pack pricing, which Mike spoke about
earlier, as well as our other programs there to help continue to provide great value for them. We see the relaunch of

LowesForPros to be a significant opportunity to continue to drive share and increase penetration with that customer. As
Mike said, we will begin to test that with some customers in Q2, with expected full launch to be in Q3 from that
program as well.
So we feel very good about where we are from a pro standpoint currently. We believe they reacted very well to our
initiatives and our programs that we put in place over the last 18 months, and we continue to see that to progress into
this quarter. And Mike, I'll turn it over to you and let you talk about some of the initiatives, from a merchandising
standpoint we are working on, from a brand and assortment standpoint.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Absolutely. We made good progress on being more relevant with pros. Inventory depth
certainly critical. Localization, we continue to make progress on, as well as on brands. We continue to work to our
brand portfolio to ensure that we have the right brands that pros need. So we feel very good that our holistic approach
of separating out those divisions that lean very heavy towards categories that have a heavy penetration of pro. Spoke
about it earlier. Lumber and building material, tools, hardware, rough electric, rough plumbing, millwork that putting
them together under a single leader has helped us put more focus there, and the team continues to make progress on
those areas that are critical for pros.

Your next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. First was on labor, training and kind of where
you are with labor add back and training. I think last fall you had thought you needed to maybe add some more training
hours, so maybe an update on that. And then on gross margin, as you know, your main competitor has essentially put a
cap on where they want to see gross margin go for competitive reasons and I'm curious what your point of view is on
that as it pertains to Lowe's and where you think your gross margin should be.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Dan, this is Rick. I will take the first part of that question and then turn it over to Mike to
answer the question around margin. From a labor perspective, we feel very good about where we were and what the
operations teams with Dennis Knowles was able to accomplish in the quarter as we continue to look at payroll to
provide positive leverage during the quarter during a very difficult environment from a weather perspective, it was an
outstanding job on their part. And we feel comfortable that the labor that we added back into our stores last year as part
of our weekday teams helped us to fill that void that we had during the peak selling times of the weekdays and we think
there is no need to continue to add any incremental labor back into that environment.
So currently, what we're looking at, of course, is as sales improve, we continue to add labor to match sales rate, that's
the way our staffing plans works. And our part-time mix gives us the flexibility to flex up and flex down to meet sales
trends throughout the quarter, and that's what really helped us continue to provide solid leverage during Q1.
As it relates to training, we spoke about training in Q3 from a perspective of making sure that our investment of those
weekday team members was as solid as we could get it and we realized there were some training gaps there. And we
made some adjustments to the program to help solve that issue by placing them into specific departments versus
allowing them to work in multiple departments, therefore able to provide them much better training to assist the
customers in those departments.
We feel good about that. The other aspect that we talk about as we continue to migrate to becoming an omni-channel
retailer is to continue to develop the skill sets of our employees in the stores and we vested a substantial amount of
training time last year, making sure that they were able to address our customers when they came into the stores
looking at the type of trips they were in to shop, whether that be the customer was in on a specific mission trip, whether
it was a project trip, or whether they were in the store seeking inspiration.
We did a substantial training with every associate on being able to recognize those and being able to adapt to the
customer and what they wanted focus on. So we continue to work on training. It continues to be a significant focus as
we move into 2014, but we feel very good about our programs from last year, the investments we made and the results

they provided.
So, Mike, I will turn it over to you to answer the question on margins.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Sure, absolutely. Our 2014 outlook talks to approaching 35%, but we really don't think
there's a hard cap on gross margin. Let me talk about value improvement, because that's the process that we use to
really manage how we do our line reviews which is a huge contributor to gross margin.
We have a very balanced approach with our vendor partners. We always look at growth, for both us and our partners,
innovation is central in those discussions. We look at value for customers. We see these engagement opportunities as an
opportunity to build partnership, and, of course cost is always a part of that discussion. But when you think about gross
margin, you always got to think about line design as it impacts mix, and you got to think about the ability to find
efficiencies with both us and our vendor partners so that we can drive our costs.
So we think all of this comes together to allow us to go after improved margin and it's working and it's working very
well, along all of those fronts. So I don't know that there's a hard cap. We are continuing to drive mix, look for
efficiencies and while improving our partnerships and going after innovation and we are doing it in an environment and
in a way that's allowing us to expand margin.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Dan, this is Rick again. Just to expand on one other key point and that's related to our sales
and operation planning process. One of the things that we identified as we continue to look over the last couple of years
was our ability to attach and how do we really continue to drive that through our employees and how we merchandise
our stores and get our stores prepared for events. And our sales and operation and planning process helps us really
understand the attachment to go along with the core item, which ultimately helps us improve the basket, therefore
helping us to improve the overall margin mix within the basket as well.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Dan, this is Robert, just to sum it up, as we go to market, we will continue to be priced
competitively as Rick spoke of. It's helping mix the margin with attachment and the right items there. As Mike said
we've done a lot of work the past couple of years going through our value improvement line review process, if you'll
recall during that period of time there was some disruption where we had excess product that we had to clear and mark
down and we started to cycle through the majority of that now, so a little bit cleaner numbers are coming forward. But
just so the underpinning for all of that is we will continue to be competitive on price in the marketplace across all
channels that we compete in.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Hi, good morning, and thank you. You touched on a couple of regions, I think you
mentioned the Southwest and the Northeast. I was just wondering how many regions do you have and can you maybe
just talk across all of them, sort of what you saw relative to the company-wide comp in the quarter?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Yes, Dennis, this is Rick. We have three operating divisions. And that's what you heard us
speak about when we talked about the southern markets, the West and the Northeast. Within those, we have 14 regions
encompassing a mix of each of those. What we saw was, as Bob highlighted in his comments, where we had solid
weather or good weather, more normalized, we saw solid mid single digit comps around each of those geo zones, as we
refer to them, deep South and South being particularly strong.
The central parts of the country performed well, particularly as we got into the latter half of the quarter. The North and
the upper North was where we saw a greater amount of weather impact and where we saw the negative comps from an
overall sales environment as a result. So we feel very good in those markets for the quarter from the deep South,
southern and central areas, the North and the upper North is what put pressure on the overall performance.

<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay. So at the highest level, the South and the West was up mid single and the northeast
was down at the three divisions?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Correct.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: And Dennis, when you look – this is Robert. When you look inside the South and the West,
every region in those had positive comps. When you get up to the North, the division, every region within that had
negative comps. So it really does kind of accentuate what we saw during the quarter.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay. Great. And then the second question, just on margins, I think you highlighted the
value and improvement, as well as mix on gross margin in the quarter. Can you separate those two and just maybe talk
to – on the outlook how those two things would trend particularly here in the second quarter?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So of the 70 basis points improvement, value improvement was 45 basis points and mix was 20.
As we cycled last year's value improvement activity we would expect that to diminish as the year progresses. The mix
impact was primarily the result of selling less seasonal goods in the first quarter. We would expect that to flip in the
second quarter as we recover lost sales. It should be a slight drag in Q2 and then revert back to being flattish or neutral
in the second half of the year.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you guys.

Your next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Citi Research.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to know if we could have a little bit more detail on
any changes we can expect from the changes in the merchandising team. Could we see further refinement to your
merchandising strategy and how disruptive could this be? And then just with regards to some of the refinements that
you continue to make at the store, was there anything during the quarter that you could highlight that was particularly
beneficial?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Sure, absolutely. This is Mike Jones. We don't anticipate any radical changes in our
merchandising strategy. Our initiatives are very well vetted. We believe they will continue to create value for us. We
love the enhanced partnerships that we have with our vendor partners. We are extremely close with our vendor
partners. Our team has a very strong bench and all of our leadership was united in our development of our functional
plans. So there is no anticipated change at all. And we're confident that the changes that we've made with some of these
promotions of some of our talent that's on our bench will be well received by our vendor partnerships. So we're very
comfortable there.
I spoke of the outdoor living set as one of the combined efforts between our merchandising team and our customer
experience design team, which in particular in areas that had pretty good weather did extremely well, extremely well.
So we're excited about that. As you look at the divisions that performed above the company average, you'll notice that
our fashion fixtures is one of them, and if you walk our stores, you'll see a much more enhanced display of the way we
do our bath sets, which is another example of how our merchandising team is working with our vendor partners to have
the right products, as well as the influence of our customer experience design team as well.
So we're very excited about our merchandising initiatives. We're very excited about our partnerships and we don't
anticipate any dramatic changes.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: And you also had a question about was it any store refinements? I'm sorry, I didn't really
catch what the intent of your question was.

<Q - Katharine McShane>: Just as you continue to refine some of your merchandising strategies, were there any wins
during the quarter that maybe were surprising to the upside or that were better than expected?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Yeah, the two I would note would be the success that we had with our fashion fixtures, as
well as our seasonal set that I spoke of.

Your next question is from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Thanks, guys. I have a couple of questions. First, on the traffic and ticket mix, I think at the
beginning of the year, you guys said about two-thirds of the comp would be ticket and one-third traffic. Given how the
first quarter played out, do you expect that to change for the full year? And as May has recovered, how does the traffic
and the ticket breakdown look like?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: So as we think about our seasonal business, our lawn and garden, in particular, is a huge
driver of transactions and traffic for us. That was weak in the first quarter. That is beginning to recover in the second
quarter. So that gave rise to an out-of-balance performance with almost all of the comp being driven by ticket in Q1. As
we get that traffic in lawn and garden, this is back in Q2, that is more balanced, almost 50-50 thus far in the second
quarter. We think for the year, the two-thirds/one-third ticket and traffic still holds up.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: That's great and helpful. And then in dot-com, you mentioned in several of the answers how it's
an initiative with the pro and with the consumer and with some of the labor initiatives you have in the specialist
departments. Could you give us an update on where you are on that, and in terms of percentage of sales or ship-to-store
or other things you've got going on?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, overall, I'll start and have the others jump in. Greg, overall, our dot-com business was
up a little more than 25% in the quarter. So we are pleased with what we see there. Obviously we're excited about
adding LowesForPros in the second quarter to really give the pro a dedicated website to be able to transact on with the
additional functionality that Mike spoke of in his comments. We're still continuing to see about 50% of what is bought
online is actually picked up in store. So the customer is using it in a really – it's really our whole strategy of being there
to meet their needs whenever and wherever they choose to engage.
And then on top of that, there's about another 20% that is delivered from the store to the consumers' home. So if you
think about it, about 70% of what we sell online is fulfilled through that store channel. So, it's, as I said, being there
whenever and wherever the customer chooses to engage. And we're happy to ship it to them, have it available in store
or whatever. And we're continuing to add functionality, continuing to add the necessary products and refine the offering
that we have out there. Mike, I don't know if you have anything else on...
<A - Michael A. Jones>: No, I think you summarized it well. The one thing that I would add is that we do have very
strong dot-com businesses in some of the seasonal areas and some of the OPE where we tend to index very highly. And
as we look at the first quarter, you can see that some of the divisions that were below the company average have a
pretty big footprint on our dot-com sales and so that was a little bit of a headwind that we expect to see pick back up as
we go into the second quarter, but all told, we feel very comfortable with the continued build-out of our omni-channel
environment.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: That's great. Good luck, guys.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks.

And your final question will come from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Michael A. Baker>: Thank you. Hi, guys. Just a quick one to start. You said the weather impacted you by 150
basis points. If we add that back, then would you have comped at 2.4% in the first quarter, which still would be below
your plan. Your plan was for the first quarter to be the highest comp of the year, which means certainly above 4%. So
what else missed on the comp line in the first quarter?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, we were expecting some level of deflation in the quarter. It was a little bit higher than we
anticipated. As we think about the estimates of comp impact, they are not precise as Rick and Robert took you through
the geography, strong performance in West and South, really challenged performance in the Northeast. So we do feel
like we can recover the lost sales. We do feel like there's other activity. Some of the initiatives that Mike spoke of
regarding the experience design. Rick and Mike both talked to you about some of the pro initiatives that's going to gain
traction throughout the course of the year. So we feel like we will recover the lost sales and do have other initiatives
that will drive the 4% comp for the year. And the good news is we're seeing evidence of that, thus far, in May.
<Q - Michael A. Baker>: Okay. So to follow up on that, how much did deflation hurt, and does that get better? And I
guess maybe my words instead of yours, but you said 150 basis points. I guess, what we should interpret that is, that's
not that precise. The weather could have been more or less than that.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Right. So we estimate it's 150 basis points. However, the West and South comped roughly
positive 4%, Northeast comped roughly negative 5%. So, that tells you that's a 900 point basis spread. So...
<Q - Michael A. Baker>: And what percent of your stores are in the Northern region?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: I'm sorry?
<Q - Michael A. Baker>: What percent of the stores are in the Northern region? Is it roughly a third, a third, a third?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Roughly, 30% of our sales. So we've got a consistent methodology to tackle weather impact.
That hasn't changed. But if you take a look at just the division performance, you can see that weather could potentially
be bigger than that. The deflation impact was 35 basis points. We see improvement in comparisons relative to lumber.
So we see that headwind going away as the year progresses.
<Q - Michael A. Baker>: Okay, thanks. Very helpful.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Thank you, Mike.
