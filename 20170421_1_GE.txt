MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At
this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Ellen, and I will be your conference coordinator today.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of
Investor Communications. Please proceed.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to GE's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Presenting first today is
our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; followed by our CFO, Jeff Bornstein. Before we start, I would like to remind you
that our earnings release, presentation and supplemental had been available since earlier today on our website at
www.ge.com/investor. Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward looking and are based
on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our
website, those elements can change as the world changes.
And with that, I will turn it over to Jeff Immelt.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Matt. GE had a good quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. While the resource sector is
challenging, we had the strongest Oil & Gas orders in 10 quarters. We see global growth accelerating while the U.S.
continues to improve. Since the beginning of 2017, I visited China, Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. All are
stronger than last year. With orders growth of 10%, we've seen an attractive environment for GE overall.

EPS was $0.21 for the quarter. Excluding the impact of uncovered restructuring, industrial EPS was up 15%, and
Verticals grew by 20%. Organic revenue was up 7%, our strongest quarter in more than two years. Segment operating
profit grew by 15% organically, and total industrial profit was up 20%.
Margins are expanding and our cost-out programs are accelerating. Our cash performance was worse than we expected
to start the year with CFOA of $400 million and negative Industrial CFOA. We had several one-timers and grew
working capital in the first quarter, which we expect to turn around in the second quarter and be on plan for the year.
We executed on our portfolio goals. The Water sale exceeded our expectations and should produce a $2 billion gain
and $2 billion of cash. GE Capital has exited PRA supervision, completing its pivot. This is an incredible
accomplishment for the team. Two years after we announced our GE Capital strategy, our actions are largely complete.
And Baker Hughes is on track for a midyear close.
We're off to a strong start and are reconfirming our framework for the year. We're exceeding our goals for organic
growth in margins. We expect to hit our goal for $1 billion of structural cost out, and our plan is to be on track for cash
and capital allocation for the year.
Orders were very strong in the quarter, up 10%, which was 7% organically. Backlog grew by $3 billion. Equipment had
a great quarter with growth of 11%. Services were strong as well with growth of 8%. Pricing was about flat. Orders
growth was broad-based. We saw expansion in six of seven segments and nine of 12 regions.
Let me give you a few order highlights that were particularly significant: power equipment was up 25%; growth
markets were up 27%; Aviation spares grew by 25%; Healthcare equipment was up 10%; Life Sciences grew by 15%,
Renewable service doubled, LED orders grew by 42%. We were encouraged that Oil & Gas orders grew by 9%. Global
orders grew by 20% behind some very specific initiatives. Orders grew by double digits in six of seven businesses.
Highlights include a big Kazakhstan rail deal, Aviation LEAP orders of $250 million, power winds in India worth $370
million, global onshore wind deals worth $270 million, Healthcare in China grew by 28%, and mining grew by 16%.
Digital orders grew by 7%, including 70% growth in ServiceMax, 60% in Power, 55% in Renewables, and 41% in Oil
& Gas. We continue to reposition our legacy IT businesses for growth in the future. We signed big global deals at NEC,
Bridgestone, South32, and Deutsche Bahn. We established an alliance with China Telecom to bring Predix to China.
We expect strong orders to accelerate through the year.
So, this start reinforces our organic growth goal of 3% to 5% for 2017. Organic revenue growth of 7% was ahead of
expectations. Revenue strength was broad-based with six of seven segments having positive organic growth. The old
power businesses, what you see is Power and Renewables was exceptionally strong with both growing 18%, and
Aviation grew by 8%.
Our growth initiatives are paying off. Globalization is a major driver with growth market revenue expanding by 10%
where India was up 27%; Middle East, up 12%; and Africa, up 77%. Services growth was up 8%, and six of seven
businesses expanded in the quarter. This was led by Aviation up 18% and repowering drove 84% growth in
Renewables.
New products also added to growth. We finished the quarter with 30 HA turbines of backlog and 12,200 LEAP engine
orders and commitments. Healthcare imaging orders in the U.S. grew by 13% behind excellent new products. Digital
revenue grew by 16% led by Power, Oil & Gas, Renewables. The Digital growth outside Verticals doubled in the
quarter. GE Store continues to work. GE Capital supported $2.2 billion of industrial orders, and GE-to-GE orders grew
substantially.
Margins were also a good story. Industrial operating profit margins grew by 130 basis points with gross margins
expanding by 90 basis points. Segment margins grew by 110 basis points. Efficiency was driven by value gap,
productivity, and digital threat. This more than offset headwinds and mix. Corporate costs are ahead of plan, and we
saw margin growth in both equipment and services.
We're on track to reduce structural costs by $1 billion for the year, and the quarter costs were down $76 million and
$200 million lower than our original $500 million cost-out plan. We expect this to accelerate during the year. We

invested $1 billion restructuring in the quarter, and for the year, we expect gains in restructuring to offset. We remain
committed for $1 billion of cost out in 2017 and $1 billion of cost out in 2018.
On cash, we have CFOA of $400 million. This included a dividend from GE Capital of $2 billion. Industrial CFOA
was a negative $1.6 billion. There's no change to our 2017 framework of total CFOA of $18 billion to $21 billion, and
Industrial CFOA of $12 billion to $14 billion. We built working capital in the quarter to support growth, and we're
adjusting to a different profile with Alstom, and we're impacted by several one-timers. Cash is lumpy, and we expect to
have a strong second quarter.
I've asked Jeff to give you a little bit more context on cash flow on the next page. We received an additional $2 billion
dividend from GE Capital in April, bringing the year-to-date total to $4 billion against the plan of $6 billion to $7
billion for the year, so a good start. Cash ended the quarter at $7.9 billion. We paid $2.1 billion of dividends and had
$2.3 billion of buyback for a total of $4.4 billion return to shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to give you more details on cash and operations.
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Thanks, Jeff. As Jeff said, we had a strong quarter on orders, revenues, and margins. However, our Industrial CFOA
was at $1.6 billion usage of cash, about $1 billion below our expectations. We expect to see most of this come back
over the remainder of the year, and we see no change to our outlook for the year of $12 billion to $14 billion of
Industrial CFOA.
Walking left side of the page, industrial net income plus depreciation in the quarter was $1.5 billion. Working capital
was a use of $1.3 billion. This is about $700 million higher usage than our expectation. The miss was mainly driven by
Power and Renewables, partially offset by better performance in our Healthcare business.
Receivables was a benefit of $200 million, about $400 million less than our plan. Operationally, we've seen
improvement in collections, however, we didn't collect on a number of accounts in the quarter that we expected to. In
Aviation, which historically has not had issues with past dues, we missed by about $200 million on five customer
accounts, which will clear in the second quarter with no issue. In Power, we didn't collect on several delinquent
accounts in top regions around the world, but we expect to collect these throughout the rest of the year, including in the
second quarter.
Inventory was a use of $800 million, about $100 million worse than we expected. Most of the businesses were right on
the plan. The miss was driven by softness in the U.S. healthcare market, particularly around ultrasound and LCS, but
we expect to work off this inventory over the remainder of the year.
Payables were a use of $400 million, roughly as we expected. This is driven by payments of fourth quarter purchases
that were significantly higher than the new volume added in the first quarter, and we see this dynamic mostly every
year in the first quarter. Progress collections was a use of $300 million. This was primarily driven by two things. First,
there was the impact of renewables from shipping equipment in the first quarter following the buildup of progress
collections from safe harbor wind turbines in the fourth quarter. Secondly, we had several large orders in the quarter
that did not reach financial closure. These includes large orders in Energy Connections in Iraq, a power deal in Algeria,
and a big transportation transaction in Angola. We expect these deals to close in the second and third quarter.
Contract assets were a use of $1.9 billion. This was $300 million worse than expected. Of the $1.9 billion, $500 million
was from our long-term equipment contracts where the timing of our billion revenue recognition milestones differ. This
will catch up throughout the year as we execute against the contracts. The remaining $1.4 billion is our long-term
service agreements. There were two pieces to this. $600 million is related to service contracts where we've incurred
costs and booked the revenue, but haven't yet billed the customer. We expect this to partly come back over the year as
we see higher asset utilization in Power and Aviation. And we've seen these similar trends in the prior years.

The other $800 million are contract adjustments driven by better cost performance and part life, primarily driven by
Power and Aviation. Versus expectations, the $300 million of lower cash on contract assets is driven by $200 million
of long-term equipment contracts that we expect to come back throughout the year and the $100 million is from
services contract adjustments I just walked through, which will come back over the remaining life of those contracts as
we build the utilization. In total, we're about $1 billion off our first quarter plan, but we'll recover the vast majority over
the second through the fourth quarter.
In the first half of 2016, we delivered $400 million of CFOA. For 2017, we expect significantly strong cash
performance in the second quarter with sequential improvement throughout the year. Our total year plan is $12 billion
to $14 billion. That's driven by an increase in net income plus depreciation, and we expect to see a benefit from
working capital similar to last year's benefit. Contract assets will be similar impact as 2016, and other cash flows will
be lower cash usage this year, largely driven by the absence of the onetime [ph] ELTO (12:34) payment in 2016.
So, with that, I'll move on to consolidated results. Revenues were $27.7 billion, down 1% in the quarter. Industrial
revenues were flat at $25 billion. As you can see on the right side of the page, the Industrial segments were up 1% on a
reported basis. Organically, Industrial segment revenue was up 7%, affected by the Appliance disposition.
Industrial operating plus Vertical EPS was $0.21, flat with prior year. Excluding gains in restructuring, which was a
$0.03 headwind versus the first quarter of last year, Industrial operating Verticals EPS was up 12%.
Operating EPS was $0.14 in the quarter, up from $0.06 in the first quarter of last year. This incorporates other
continuing GE Capital activity including excess debt headquarter runoff costs that I'll cover separately on the Capital
page.
Continuing EPS of $0.10 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS of $0.07 includes discontinued
operations. The total disc ops impact was a negative $0.03 in the quarter driven by GE Capital exits that we executed in
the quarter.
The GE tax rate was 15%, in line with our total year mid-teens guidance. The GE Capital tax rate was favorable,
reflecting the tax benefit on a pre-tax continuing loss.
On the right side are the segment results. As I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 1% on a reported basis
and up 7% organically. Six of the seven businesses were positive organically, with Power and Renewables up double
digits. Industrial segment op profit was up 9%, and Industrial op profit, which includes corporate operating costs, was
up 11%.
On the bottom of the page, as I mentioned earlier, Industrial operating plus Vertical EPS was $0.21, up 12% excluding
gains in restructuring with Industrial operating EPS up 15% on the same basis. Included in the $0.21 was $0.08 of
uncovered restructuring that I'll go through on the next page.
So, next on Industrial and other items in the quarter. As I said, we had $0.08 of charges related to Industrial
restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $1 billion on a pre-tax basis with more than
$300 million of Alstom synergy investments primarily related to Power in Europe.
We also made significant investments in Corporate, Oil & Gas, Energy Connections & Lighting, and Healthcare in the
quarter. Restructuring charges totaled about $800 million, and BD charges were approximately $200 million related to
Baker Hughes, the Water disposition, the Industrial Solutions disposition, and the Digital acquisitions. There were no
gains in the quarter.
For the year, we expect about $0.25 of restructuring to offset by $0.25 of gains from Water and Industrial Solutions
dispositions. We are targeting a third quarter close for the Water transaction, and a fourth quarter close for the
Industrial Solutions transaction. For the second quarter, we expect to do about $0.07 of restructuring with no offset in
gains.
Next, I'll cover the segments. I'll start with the Power business. Power orders of $6.1 billion were up 8% with
equipment higher by 25% and services flat. Equipment growth of 25% was driven by gas power systems, up 12%; and

Steam Power Systems up almost 100%. Gas power systems was driven by a higher aero of 20 units and 10 more
HRSGs versus last year. Gas turbine orders were down 13 units, 12 versus 25. We had orders for two H units including
our first H in China. We have 38 units in backlog and expect to ship 23 Hs in 2017.
Steam Power Systems recorded orders totaling $591 million, up almost 100%, primarily driven by two projects for
which the business will provide coal-fired turbine islands. These orders were taken by an existing JV within Alstom,
which we took majority control of in the quarter. Service orders were flat. Total orders for upgrades were up 34%, but
the AGPs were down five units, 20 versus 25 a year ago. Offsetting upgrade growth was lower transactional services in
Europe and the Middle East and lower new unit installation volume. Revenues of $6.1 billion were higher by 17% with
equipment revenue growing 59% and services revenue flat. Equipment revenue growth was driven by higher deliveries
of gas turbines, HRSGs, and aero units.
We shipped 20 gas turbines versus 13 a year ago. In addition, we shipped 24 HRSGs versus 1 and 11 aero units versus
5 compared with last year. H shipments were essentially flat at 4 units. Service revenues were flat despite strong
upgrade growth of 26% including lower AGPs of 21 versus 27. Upgrade growth was offset by lower boiler service
volume in North America and fewer major outages in the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
Power earned just under $800 million operating profit, up 39%. Performance was principally driven by cost
productivity and equipment volume, offset partly by mix of equipment versus service. Gas power systems and Steam
Power Systems drove most of the improvement in profitability.
Power had a good quarter driving both equipment orders and equipment profitability. The business is intensely focused
on structural cost and delivering $500 million of cost out for the year. Power had a very strong organic growth quarter
on higher aero turbines and higher gas turbines shipments, driving organic growth up 18%. Our view for the year of
mid-single digit organic growth has not changed. Power is on track for 100 to 105 gas turbines in 2017 and expect to
deliver the upgrade growth including 155 to 165 AGPs. No change in the outlook for the business provided in the
March investor review.
On Renewables, the business had a solid quarter. Orders of $2.1 billion grew 8% with onshore wind higher by 4% and
Hydro orders up 39%. Onshore wind orders were up on $167 million of repower commitments versus none last year.
The strength in repower was partially offset by low wind turbine orders, down 8%.
We took orders for 589 units versus 716 last year, down 18%, but the megawatts for units order grew by 3%. The lower
unit count was driven by the U.S., which was down 61% after a very strong fourth quarter, partially offset by a very
strong international growth, up almost double. The wind market is very competitive with pressure on price both in the
U.S. and globally. Hydro secured a few large equipment orders in Turkey and Nigeria for eight Francis turbines.
Backlog were 8% year-over-year to %13.4 billion.
Renewables revenue of $2 billion grew 22% driven by onshore wind, up 11%; and Hydro, up two times. Onshore wind
growth was largely driven by repowering deliveries. Wind turbine shipments were down 15%, 567 turbines versus 668
a year ago. However, the megawatts that we shipped were essentially flat on the larger turbines.
Operating profit grew 29% in the quarter, driven by cost-out actions on 2 megawatt NPI, positive value gap, and
repowering volume. Partially offset by higher NPI spend on the new 3 megawatt turbine, margin expanded 20 basis
points in the quarter. The business made good progress in the 2.X megawatt NPI unit cost but will require additional
cost actions given the competitiveness in the market. They are earlier in the learning curve and on the cost-out
processes on 3 megawatt NPIs.
We closed the LM acquisition this week, and the vertical integration will enhance the business ability to drive cost
performance and growth.
In Aviation, before I discuss the first quarter results for the business, I want to make you aware of a change we've made
to how we report our Aviation spares rate. Historically, we provided an all-in spares rate that included external
shipments of spares, spares used in time and materials shop visits, and spares consumed in shop visits for our engines
under long-term service agreements. Going forward, our spares rate will only include externally shipped spares and

spares used in time and materials shop visits.
Over the past several years, the strong growth in our long-term services agreements and the associated shop visits has
driven the percentage of spares used in LTSAs to be a much greater proportion of the historical order and sales rate.
These spares are also part of the LTSA billing and are already accounted for in revenues.
We believe the new spares rate provides investors with more visibility to transactional market dynamics. Consumption
of spares in long-term service agreements can be impacted by customer fleet management, optimization of shop visits
over the life of the contract or for various other reasons. Starting with the first quarter of 2017, we will report only a
ship rate for spares in this new basis as the orders and shipments are virtually the same. This change does not impact
any reported financial information. Historical information for spares rate on the new basis as well as the old method are
included in the supplemental presentation material.
Moving to Aviation's first quarter performance, the business continues to execute well in a strong market. Global
revenue passenger kilometers grew 7% year-to-date February with strength in both domestic and international routes.
Air freight volumes increased 7.2% in February. Orders in the quarter were $7.4 billion with equipment up 5%.
Commercial engine orders were up 3% on higher LEAP and GEnx, partially offset by lower GE90 and CF6 orders.
$1.7 billion of new commercial engine orders included $932 million for LEAP, $206 million for CF34, $130 million
for GE90, and $166 million of GEnx orders. CFM orders were also up 13% to $186 million. Military equipment orders
of $169 million were down 46% driven by no repeat of a large Black Hawk T700 Army order from last year.
Service orders grew 17%. Commercial service orders were higher by 18% with CSA growth of 20% and spares ADOR
of $21.7 million a day was up 25% on the new basis. Military service orders were up 40% at $610 million on increased
spare parts. Backlog finished the quarter at $158 billion, up 3%. The equipment backlog of $33 billion, down 5%, and
service backlog of $125 billion ended at 5%.
Revenues grew 9% in the quarter to $6.8 billion. Equipment revenues were down 2% driven by military down 47% on
lower shipments, partially offset by commercial growth of 12%. Commercial engine deliveries were down 7%,
however, revenue was up driven by increased mix to higher value of GEnx and LEAP engines. Service revenues were
up 17% driven by commercial spares rate of $21.7 million a day, up 25%, again, the same as the order rate.
Op profit in the quarter totaled $1.7 billion, up 10%, primarily driven by favorable price, volume and cost productivity,
partly offset by the negative impact of 81 LEAP shipments versus zero last year. Margins expanded 50 basis points in
the quarter. Demand for the LEAP engine continues to be strong with over $900 million of orders booked in the
quarter. The reliability and performance to spec of the 41 aircraft flying with LEAP today has been excellent. The
business is generating strong productivity to offset the negative mix impact of LEAP and is on track to report 2017
margin rates about flat with last year on continuing cost improvements. We will continue to ramp production to an
expected 450 to 500 LEAP shipments for the year.
The oil and gas environment has been improving, led by increased activity in the North American onshore market. Rig
count was up 70% versus prior year and up 25% from the fourth quarter of last year and has increased sequentially each
of the last three quarters. External forecast continues to be slightly more positive on 2017 upstream spending,
particularly among independents. The timing of recovery will vary by segment, and the large degree of uncertainty
remains. Crude inventory remained at five-year highs, and markets are closely watching OPEC output compliance.
Offshore activity remains weak.
Before I get into the dynamics for the quarter, just one item regarding Oil & Gas sub-segment reporting. We combined
the turbomachinery and downstream technology businesses, so I'll talk to the performance of those businesses on a
combined basis. Orders for Oil & Gas, up $2.6 billion, were higher by 7% with equipment orders going 30%. Every
segment saw higher equipment orders. Turbomachinery and downstream grew 33%, surface up 10%, and subsea up
52%. The equipment orders' performance is a positive sign our growth is of a very low base. Service orders were down
2% but flat organically. Turbomachinery and downstream was down 2%, digital solutions was down 3%, surface down
8%, and subsea down 18%. Backlog ended the quarter at $20.4 billion, down 10% versus last year. Equipment backlog
was down 32%, but service backlog actually grew 4%.

Revenues in the quarter of $3 billion were down 9%. Equipment revenues were down 20%, driven by subsea down
29%, turbomachinery and downstream down 19%, and surface down 2%. Service revenues were flat with
turbomachinery and downstream up 13%, and digital solutions up 1%, offset by subsea down 36% and surface down
14%. Operating profit of $207 million was lower by 33%, primarily driven by lower pricing volume, partially offset by
cost out. The first half of 2017 remains very challenging for the business. Despite positive equipment orders
performance this quarter, our longer-cycle equipment businesses in turbomachinery and downstream and subsea will
lag the recovery on onshore. The team is focused on capturing growth opportunities and rebuilding its backlog. We
continue to expect increased activity in our surface, digital solutions, and transactional service businesses as we move
into the second half of the year.
The Baker Hughes deal remains on track to close midyear. We filed the draft S-4 with the SEC and continue to work
with global regulators. Both the GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes integration teams are making great progress toward
the closing.
Next up is Healthcare. Our Healthcare business had a solid quarter. Orders grew 7% versus last year and were up 8%
on an organic basis. Geographically, organic orders grew 2% in the U.S., 5% in Europe, and 21% in emerging markets.
Emerging market growth was led by China up 28%, the Middle East up 16%, and Latin America up 14%. On a product
line basis, Healthcare Systems orders grew 5%, 6% organically, driven by growth in ultrasound up 10%, and imaging
products up 12% with broad-based growth in MR and CT as well as mammo on successful NPI launches.
Growth in HCS and ultrasound was partly offset by Life Care Solutions, which was down 8% primarily driven by the
U.S. general market uncertainty around reform. Life Science grew orders 15%, led by bioprocess up 25% and core
imaging up 8%. Bioprocess growth was driven by an order for our KUBio products in the quarter. Revenues in the
quarter grew 3% both on a reported and organic basis. Healthcare Systems revenues were higher by 3% versus last
year, and Life Sciences revenue grew by 5%. Operating profit of $643 million was up 2% reported, but higher by 6%
organically, driven by volume and productivity, partially offset by negative price and program and investments. FX
was a $32 million profit drag in the quarter. Margins contracted 10 basis points on a reported basis, but were up 50
basis point excluding the effect of foreign exchange.
The business continues to execute well on new product introductions and driving cost productivity. Healthcare is
targeting further product cost out, in line with the 2016 performance they delivered. They are focused on driving more
competitive insourcing, increasing the number of Brilliant Factories and over 300 cost-out engineers dedicated to
product competitiveness. Despite some uncertainty in the shorter-cycle, lower-ticket segment of the U.S. market around
reforms, we believe the broad healthcare market supports our view of low- to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth
for the year.
Next is Transportation. Domestic market dynamics were slightly more positive, building on the modest improvement
we saw in the fourth quarter. North American carload volume was up 4.4% in the quarter driven by 2.2% growth in the
intermodal carload space and 6.6% growth in commodity carloads.
Commodity carload growth was primarily driven by coal, which was up 15%, and agriculture higher by 4%. Petroleum
continued its weakness, down 6%. In addition, GE parked locos were down 24% from last year and down 11% from
year-end. Although these signs of improvement are important, they're off a weak base and as of yet have not signaled a
consistent trend.
Transportation orders for the quarter totaled $1.1 billion, up 70%. Equipment orders of $526 million were higher by
500%. We received orders for 37 locos and over 100 international kits versus no orders in the first quarter of last year.
The 37 loco orders included 24 locos for North America. This is the first North American Tier 4 Class 1 order we've
taken since 2014. Mining equipment orders were also higher. We received orders for 115 mining wheels versus 84 last
year. Service orders of $582 million were up 3%. Backlog finished at $20 billion, down 5% versus last year, driven by
equipment down 27%, partly offset by services up 4%.

Revenues in the quarter were higher by 6% with equipment up 15% and services down 1%. Locomotive deliveries
were about flat year-over-year at 157 with a higher mix of international locos. North American locomotives were down
33%, while international locomotive shipments grew 159% driven by deliveries in Pakistan and South Africa. Op profit
of $156 million was down 5% on unfavorable mix and higher digital investment, partially offset by cost productivity.
No change to the outlook we shared with you in December. 2017 will be a challenging year with locomotive shipments
likely down close to 50%, operating profit down double digits and pressure on margin rates. The business continues to
drive structural costs out as well as building their international backlog.
Next on Energy Connections & Lighting, orders for this segment totaled $2.6 billion, which were down 2%. Energy
Connection orders of $2.4 billion were down 12% driven by Power Conversion down 36% and Grid down 8%, partially
offset by Industrial Solutions, which grew 11% in the quarter. Power Conversion performance was driven by continued
pressure in Oil & Gas and no repeat of a large inverter order in the first quarter of last year.
Grids' first quarter performance was impacted by orders delays in the Middle East that will close in the second quarter,
specifically a large order in Iraq. Industrial Solutions, which was up 11%, outperformed versus the NEMA market,
which was up an estimated 3% in the quarter. Our current platform had orders in the quarter totaling $243 million.
Revenues for Energy Connections grew 1% reported and 4% organically. Grid grew 19%, partly offset by Industrial
Solutions down 2% and Power Conversion down 26% organically. Current and Lighting revenues were down 11%
with Current growing 3% and legacy business decreasing by 22% as we exit markets and experience lower demand for
older technology. Operating profit in the quarter of $28 million was substantially higher versus last year, driven by
structural cost actions. Energy Connections earned $20 million and Current and Lighting earned $8 million. No change
in the 2017 outlook. We expect better execution from these businesses with double-digit profit growth for the year. We
expect divestiture of Industrial Solutions to happen late in the year.
Finally, I'll cover GE Capital. The Verticals earned $535 million in the quarter, up 8% from the prior year, driven
principally by lower impairments, higher tax benefits, partially offset by lower gains. GECAS, Energy Finance and
Industrial Finance, all had strong quarters, and overall portfolio quality remains stable. In the first quarter, the Verticals
funded $1.8 billion of on-book volume and enabled $2.2 billion of Industrial orders.
Other continuing operations generated a $582 million loss in the quarter, driven by excess interest expense,
restructuring costs related to portfolio transformation and headquarters operating costs. As I've said in the past, these
costs will continue to come down as excess debt matures and we rightsize the organization.
Versus the first quarter of last year, other continuing costs are down $800 million, driven by these lower excess debt
costs, non-repeat of costs associated with both the first quarter of 2016 hybrid tender offer and the preferred equity
exchange. In addition, we expect incremental tax benefits associated with the completion of the GE Capital
restructuring towards the second half of the year. Discontinued operations generated a $242 million loss, driven by Exit
Plan-related items and operating costs. Overall, GE Capital reported a net loss of $290 million.
We ended the quarter with $167 billion of assets, including $43 billion of liquidity. Assets were down $16 billion from
year-end. GE Capital closed on $7 billion of transactions in the quarter, including the sale of our French consumer
finance platform and our Hyundai JV. In total $198 billion has been actioned since April of 2015, $263 billion
including the spinoff of Synchrony. All major sales activity related to GE Capital Exit Plan is now complete. $8 billion
of assets remaining will largely be run off over the next 12 to 18 months. As a result of this, as of March 30, GE Capital
non-U.S. activities are no longer subject to consolidated supervision by the UK's PRA.
GE Capital paid $2 billion of dividends during the quarter and an additional $2 billion this week. We remain on track
for $6 to $7 billion of dividends for the total year. Overall, the GE Capital team delivered a strong performance from
Verticals while executing on all aspects of our action plan.
And with that, I will turn it back to Jeff.

Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Jeff. We are reconfirming our 2017 operating framework. We should meet all of our goals for operating EPS.
We're off to a good start on organic growth and margins. The goals for industrial operating profit and structural cost out
are in sight. Despite a slow start, we plan to hit $12 billion to $14 billion of Industrial CFOA for the year. We believe
that capital dividend should be $6 billion to $7 billion for the year. Dispositions are on track. We're on track to return
$19 billion to $21 billion to investors through dividend and buyback.
To recap, we had 10% orders growth, 7% organic growth, 130 basis points of margin expansion, and 20% organic
industrial operating profit growth, and a commitment to hit CFOA for the year. So, this is a good start.
Matt, now for some questions.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Thanks, Jeff. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I want to talk about the cadence of the cost out. I get to like a $230 million number in 1Q. I
think that's what you said. I would assume if you did that every quarter, you get to your $2 billion on a kind of steady
cadence, but the point is you commented that that would ramp a little bit faster through the year. So, how do you think
about that $2 billion? Is that something that comes out steady over two years or is that something where you can
front-end load a fair amount of it?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah. Okay. Okay.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: And just on that, if you can give a little bit of color on how much of that cost out is really from
last year's restructuring versus new cost initiatives?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah. So, what we're talking about is structural cost or base cost, so fixed costs. It
excludes variable costs.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yeah.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We talked about $2 billion of cost out, $1 billion each in 2017 and 2018. So, the goal this
year is take $1 billion of that base cost out. If you go to the supplement, we do a walk-through for you in the first
quarter. So, in the first quarter, those costs year-over-year were down about $75 million. Now beneath that, we took out
over $375 million of those costs, and that was partly offset by a couple hundred million more as we expected higher
digital spend year-over-year and just wage inflation of about $80 million, so good underlying performance there.
It's going to accelerate over the year because we've taken an enormous number of actions here in the first quarter across
all the businesses in corporate. We talked about the effort around horizontal IT which we think is worth $250 million in
the year, what we just announced around the corporate tax team and that transition to PwC. We've taken a number of
head count actions both at corporate and across the businesses here in the first quarter, so we expect that to grow over
the course of the year. The other reference points I'd give you is when we talked at the outlook meeting, we talked
about a goal of $500 million with which we had $1.7 billion kind of pipeline against. Against that original plan, in the

first quarter, we were $200 better than that original plan. So, that gives us confidence that we're on track for the higher
plan of $1 billion for the year.
So, I think you'll continue to see better performance here in the second quarter, and then I think you'll see a real
acceleration in the second half of the year. To answer your question on restructuring from prior years, so within this
bucket of costs, let's say, we took out $375 million before digital and the effect of EOP, effect on wages, about $174
million of that $375 million was from prior-year restructuring actions.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: What I would say, Scott, having 130 basis points of margin with a lot of the structural costs
still to kick in makes us feel good on the 100 basis point goal for the year on margins.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Right. And I know you're focused on the base fixed cost. On the variable cost, how does that
play into the next several quarters?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So, as we talked about – well, let's go back to what we said at outlook. At outlook, we
talked about a goal of 100 basis points of margin improvement. And we said 50 basis points of that was going to come
from everything we were doing around restructuring, et cetera. And then the incremental cost plan was going to deliver
the next 50 basis points. If you look at gross margins in the quarter, we're better by 90 basis points. So, gross margins is
all product and service cost. So, that's a good downpayment against delivering the total year margin.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And I would say again on gross margins, Scott, we've built in kind of a negative mix
vis-à-vis the LEAP and things like that, and we still can more than offset that with other strong programs we've got in
the company.
Operator
The next question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Hi. Could we just explore a little more what's going on in Alstom? There was a comment
about you're taking a different profile there. It was unclear what you meant by that, and it also sounds like one of the
JVs got consolidated in the quarter.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, expand on your first – I'm not sure I understood your first question, Jeff. Okay. So,
let me just talk about the JV, and then I'll let Jeff talk about the first part of your question. When we did the Alstom
acquisition, as part of that, we acquired an interest in the JV in the steam space in India. And we're a minority
shareholder. So, we spent an insignificant amount of money to actually gain control of that JV in India. So, in the steam
space, it's around steam equipment. It largely services India.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And then, Jeff, the comment I made is the profile of Alstom was always very highly skewed
towards their last quarter. It's going to take a while to get that normalized on kind of the GE timeframe just based on
some of the EPC work and project work they do. So, that was the comment that I made.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, I don't think that the profile is materially different than our own business. We have
a lot of long-term contracts, 81 long contracts that you know about. We're really building against those here in the first
quarter. Those will hit building milestones over the course of the year, and like our own equipment businesses, the
Alstom equipment businesses will improve on cash performance throughout the year.

The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Morning.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Morning. So, obviously, order growth inflected pretty positively in the quarter, and we
know you have your management incentives in line toward delivering significant cash flow. So, why isn't cash better?
Why not maybe even sacrifice some orders from difficult customers if you have to for better cash or maybe pressure
suppliers even harder to generate more cash? I guess, the question we're trying to figure out is whether the issues are
transient and cyclical, which we think they are or some people think they're structural, especially in Power. How would
you answer that question?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, when you look at the first quarter performance, we talked about being $1 billion
lower than our expectations, $700 million of that in working capital. And within that $700 million, $400 million really
related to receivables. Our receivables performance actually was pretty good in the quarter. Our collection, in fact, was
better year-over-year. We did factor $1.3 billion less versus the first quarter of last year, but we expected to do that. It
was really around the accounts I talked about. In Aviation, we had a couple hundred million of pass-throughs that we
don't normally experience in Aviation. Those are already clearing here in the second quarter. And then some big
pass-throughs in the Middle East in our Power business that are on schedule. They, I believe, will collect the majority
of what we expect to collect in the first quarter. We'll do that in the second quarter.
Now, we had a small kind of $100 million kind of miss in inventory versus our own expectations. Interestingly, most of
the businesses hit their inventory expectation, and our inventory performance year-over-year was $700 million better
than the first quarter of last year. That's important because when we think about our working capital – we've talked
about $3 billion plus of working capital improvement in the year to get to $12 billion to $14 billion – a big part of that
is driven by inventory.
Last year, we were really helped by progress in AP. This year, it's about receivables and inventory. And so, getting off
to a $700 million better outcome year-over-year on inventory is good, but it was $100 million less than we thought it
would be. And that was all about Healthcare in North America, and that will liquidate. That's mostly timing around
sales and orders. So, we're not too concerned about that.
And then progress was a couple of hundred million light versus what we expected. It was a $300 million use in the
quarter. A big part of what drove that was we took enormous amounts of progress in the fourth quarter of last year in
Renewables around U.S. onshore wind and people getting ahead of the PTC. Now we're shipping against that progress,
so we're liquidating the progress. We collected the cash fourth quarter. Now we're rev rec'ing and shipping those units,
and the majority of that cash was collected last year.
Having said that, we have some really big orders, particularly in the Middle East, that we thought we're going to get to
financial close in the first quarter. It looks like most of those will get to financial close in the second quarter. I talked
about earlier the big grid order in Iraq. I think we feel really good about that. I think next week we're likely going to
announce, which was part of this progress miss, the biggest service deal in the history of our Power services business in
the Middle East, a really phenomenal transaction. We thought it was going to close a couple of weeks earlier. It's going
to close next week, we believe, so we feel good about that, and then some progress we expected to collect out of West
Africa, which will happen in the second quarter.
So, we were $1 billion off in those buckets versus what we expected. I think we feel good about how we move from
where we are today to the $12 billion to $14 billion we've talked about for the year. So, if you just go back – I'm just
trying to give you a framework on how to think about it. Listen, we committed to $17.2 billion of pre-tax operating
profit. So, using that as a baseline, from here, we see $12 billion plus of net income plus depreciation between the
second and fourth quarter. We expect to generate about $4.5 billion roughly of working capital improvements 2Q
through 4Q. That's about on par with what we did in 2016. It's within $100 million to $200 million of what we actually

did execute in 2016. Again, inventory, a big piece of that.
We expect contract assets to be a drag here in the next three quarters of about $2 billion. For the total year, that would
put us at about $3.9 billion. That is equivalent to what contract assets did in 2016. So, at the moment, we're not
planning anything better or worse. And then in other operating cash, which we give you a lot more disclosure in the K,
we see that as a positive for the year, largely because we had the long-term incentive plan payout last year. We won't
have that this year. And that's how we get to a framework of $12 billion to $14 billion.
We're also looking for some of that big base cost structure we're taking out to fall through the cash as well. So, we're
taking $1 billion of cash. That should be virtually all cash as well. It will show up in the net income plus depreciation
line. So, that's a little bit of a cash hedge here on execution for the year.
Operator
The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hi, Steve. How are you? Yeah, good.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: I'm doing okay. So, when you look at the noncash earnings from contract assets, how is
that reported in the margin bridge? And then on the restructuring, with the $800 million of restructuring and other, is
there anything in there that's not pure payback kind of head count restructuring? And if so, what's the volume of that? I
think you had a disclosure in your 10-K around that, around the breakout of restructuring. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, Steve, the $800 million of restructuring in the quarter is just that. It's restructuring.
So, they're projects with paybacks and they are very much structure. When I say structure, I mean head count and site
capacity-related. So, I'll give you some detail around it. $800 million of restructuring, about $500 million of that is
really related to workforce capacity, okay, $500 million of the $800 million. We've got about $300 million roughly
that's associated with plant capacity, consolidating footprint, et cetera. And then the balance to get to $1 billion charge
in the quarter is $200 million of BD, and that's really all Baker Hughes, Water, Industrial Systems, and some of the
Digital acquisitions we closed in the quarter. So, to answer your question, $800 million is all investment with payback.
Ask your first part of your question again.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Okay. It's on the contracts.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So, yeah. So contracts in the quarter are – so, on the CSA contracts, which is I think what
you're talking about. CSA contracts in the quarter were up $1.4 billion year-over-year. $800 million of that increase
was associated with contract updates. Okay? And that's versus $500 million a year ago. So it's higher by $266 million
year-over-year. Of the about $300 million it's up year-over-year, a little more than half of that's in Power, and most of
that is associated with updates of part costs when we change standards every year. So, for the contracts that were under
review in the first quarter, if we change the standard on the part costs and deliver against that contract for the future, we
did that update.
And then there's a small update for escalation that's mostly around our Aviation business. We update once a year on
escalation within the service contracts. That part of long-term contracts that are revenues versus billing, so outside of
contract updates, was $600 million in the first quarter, and that's really where we've incurred shop visits, outages.
We've incurred costs against those service contracts ahead of actually billing the hours or the events associated with it.
So, that's mostly timing. And some of that will come back over the course of the year because we actually bill against
the utilization or bill against an outage or a shop visit. So, I would say that's mostly timing. That's the $1.4 billion
increase that you see in contracts year-over-year.

The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hi. Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Julian. How are you?
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Good. Thanks. Just one other quick question back to the cash flow. So, Jeff Bornstein, I think
you'd called out that $400 million of Industrial CFOA in the first half of last year. Was the implication that we should
assume the first half of this year is around the same level? And then also my follow-up would just be on the contract
assets piece. You've had outflows last year of about $4 billion in cash. It's about $4 billion out this year. Before that in
2014 and 2015, it was more like $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year. So, I just wondered with GE today, as you look out
beyond this year, what's the normalized contract assets cash outflows we should expect annually?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So, let me take part two first. So, yeah, we expect the contract drag on cash flow for the
year to be roughly the same 2016 versus 2017, as you said, at about $3.9 billion. I think you got a number of
phenomenons going on. We're investing like crazy in productivity and cost-out. Whether that's additive value
engineering, driving these plant closures, restructuring, all these find its way into lower cost. When we get lower cost,
the cost to execute against our contracts improves. And when they improve, the accounting has to account for that and
where it changes our view on the ultimate profitability of these contracts. That's one method, and we're hugely focused
on that. And I think you want us focused on that. That's all future cash, future economics, et cetera, on a go-forward
basis. We're not pulling future profit for it. That is not what we're doing. We're just restating where we are in the
contract from inception to-date.
The second part is where the long-term service agreements that protect our installed base. Our penetration continues to
improve. When you look at the attach rate on the H turbine, on the LEAP engine, the population in our backlog around
these contracts is growing substantially and has over the last number of years. And so, there's a volume factor
associated with it as well.
What was the first part of your question?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think at the half, we expect CFOA to be...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So, yeah.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: ...roughly comparable.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: What I would say on the half, we think CFOA is going to be sequentially much better in
the second quarter than the first, and we would expect year-over-year CFOA to be better through the half.
Operator
The next question is from...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Equal or better, equal or better through the half.

And the next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.

about 50%. I mean, it seems to support this shift you've been talking about from gas turbine sales to power island sales
and the expanded scope. You also have pretty easy comps in Alstom, so just want a little color on the sustainability of

that kind of equipment order strength in Power despite kind of a weaker gas turbine outlook.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Look, I think, Shannon, we look at the total gas turbine market probably being roughly flat
year-over-year. We do think this increased content is kind of here to stay. So, it's our expectation that that continues
through the year. And then I think at the end of the day, we've got a decent competitive position in steam. We don't
have any false expectations about that market, but we will pick up some orders there as well.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I'll just give you a little bit of color. So, I talked about it earlier. We landed two big steam
turbine island orders in the quarter, which is hugely positive. We were much stronger on aero units and orders in the
quarter. We were up 20 year-over-year on aero derivatives, and we took 10 more HRSG orders out of Alstom in the
quarter than we did a year ago. And as you mentioned, we're down 13 gas turbines, so a little broader strength in just
about gas turbines.

The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Just a question in terms of progression of organic growth through the year. How much of
first quarter growth was pulled from the fourth quarter 2016 shortfall? And were there any orders or revenues pulled
from the second quarter and the rest of the year?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Again, certainly, there is going to be some spillover from Q4 into Q1. I still think 3% to 5%
is the right way to peg the year. We're encouraged about how the first quarter started. And I would say, Andrew,
business outside the U.S. is incrementally better than we had expected I think when we lined up the year. So, I think
there are some macro drivers that are also important in terms of our ability to capitalize on the year. And then I think
10% orders growth is a nice bellwether for investors to reinforce I think what our guidance is for 2017.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: The only thing I'd add to that, Andrew, is at year-end, we talked about Power that we had
some short ship as we expect at gas turbines, both aeros and units. As we said on the call, we expect those to close here
in 2017. We think those are good projects. Those did not close in the first quarter. So, to answer your question, the
orders performance you saw in the first quarter particularly around Power that we talked about from year-end, those
units are not in the first quarter.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Great. Thanks, Jeff.

Great, Matt. So, again, I would just spike out. I think we're very encouraged by first quarter performance: 10% orders
growth, 7% organic, 130 basis points of margin, I think a solid cash profile for the year, so I think, Matt, off to a great
start, I think very encouraged about 2017.
