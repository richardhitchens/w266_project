MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. This call is
being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief
Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Mr. Dimon, please go ahead.
Jamie Dimon
Operator, thank you very much. Welcome, everybody, to our fourth quarter call.
I just want to start by telling you that Doug Braunstein won't be doing this call. I just want to thank him for his service
to the company. I do want to remind people in spite of the fact that "The Whale" happened during that time – during
that time we also had three record years of net income. It's something we all are very proud of at this company and so,
Doug, thank you for your service if you're listening.
And we're thrilled to have Marianne here. Some of you may know, but Marianne has extensive experience in
accounting numbers. She was the controller of the investment bank for several years so she knows the investment
banking wholesale side pretty cold. She was also the CFO of the consumer side so uniquely she's got deep experience
in both parts of the company. And so I'm going to turn over to Marianne. We're thrilled to have you here. She's going to

take you through the numbers and then we'll take any and all time we need to answer your questions, as usual.
The only point before we start is I think the numbers here are really good. Look at the underlying detail of this
company: third year record income, 15% returns on tangible capital and growth in virtually every single business and
some negatives like NIM and stuff like that which will over time reverse.
So, Marianne, let me turn it over to you and just take you through the details.
Marianne Lake
Thanks, Jamie.
Good morning, everyone. This is Marianne. I'm going to take you through the presentation this morning which is
available on our website and refer you to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements which is at the back of
the presentation.
And just before we turn to earnings we also announced today the completion of the board review of CIO and the
management taskforce report. Both reports are available on our website.
So with that, we'll turn to Page 1. The firm generated net income of $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter or $1.39 a share
on revenue of $24.4 billion, up 10% year-on-year and down 6% quarter-on-quarter. And on the page, you see we had a
few significant items for the quarter and these partly offset each other and we'll go through them as we go through the
presentation. But what you don't see on the page is we also had a number of smaller items, many of which we will
mention when we go through. For example, we made a contribution to our foundation and realized some securities
gains this quarter. These smaller items also largely offset, slightly to the negative.
So for the full year, we generated record net income of $21.3 billion or $5.20 a share on revenue of $100 billion flat
year-over-year. Return on tangible common equity was 15% for both the quarter and the year and in fact, as Jamie said,
this is the third consecutive year of both record net income and 15% return on tangible common equity.
And before I turn to the businesses, I would characterize the overall performance of the quarter as strong performance
across our businesses and highlight four themes. First, the positive trends in market share that we've been seeing
continued this quarter. Year-over-year, we saw strong consumer deposit growth of 10%, mortgage origination volumes
up 33% and sales volume in Card up 9%. Also, the number one ranking in Global IB fees, including record debt
underwriting fees, record assets under custody in CIB, record revenue in Commercial Banking and record revenue and
AUM in Asset Management.
Second, we continue to see positive year-over-year loan growth. On a reported basis, the total loans of the company
were up 1% but excluding runoff portfolios, our core loan growth was 9% with record loan balances in Commercial
Banking, up 14%; record Business Banking loan balances, up 7%, and record Asset Management loan balances of $80
billion.
Third, strong credit performance continued in our wholesale portfolios, as well as in the core consumer portfolios,
which have stabilized at low levels of charge-off and delinquency. The Real Estate Portfolios continued to show
improvement as the housing market continues to recover but losses are still high.
So finally, we continued to strengthen our capital position and you can see that if you turn to Page 4 and I'll take you
there. We ended the year with Basel I and Basel III Tier 1 common of $140 billion and $144 billion respectively, both
up $5 billion this quarter. And we had strong Basel I and Basel III ratios of 11% and 8.7% respectively. And to note,
the estimate for Basel III of 8.7% includes the full impact of NPR as we understand it, compared to 8.4% last quarter,
and is approximately 150 basis points over last year on a comparable basis.
The return on Basel I RWA was 1.9% for the quarter ex-DVA. And we added a few points to the bottom of this slide,
which we think are important, and we'll spend some time at Investor Day going through our balance sheet in more
detail. But just some salient points, you can see we have $450 billion of equity and long-term debt; under $100 billion

dollars of short-term debt, which is small relative to our $700 billion of cash, high quality securities and secured
financing; and finally deposits of $1.2 trillion, which fund our $700 billion of loans.
So turning on to the businesses, if you move to page 5, Consumer and Community Banking, this includes our
Consumer and Business Banking, Mortgage Banking, Card and Auto businesses. There are some stats here that show
the strength of our Consumer franchise. The combined Consumer businesses generated $2 billion of net income for the
quarter on $12 billion of revenue. We had the number one ATM network and the number two-branch network with 150
new branches this year, number two mortgage originator and number one card issuer in the U.S. and ended the year
with over 100,000 Chase Private Clients in over 1,200 locations and we have over 31 million active online and 12
million active mobile customers.
And just another thing that we're particularly proud of this year, is a new accomplishment; we achieved the number one
ranking in the American Customer Satisfaction Index Survey for customer satisfaction among large banks.
In the appendix we included a page on Hurricane Sandy, which I won't take you through. But it was amazing to see
how our employees rallied to support our customers and while financial impact wasn't significant to the firm, the
impact we were able to have on our customers was significant.
So on to page 6, Consumer and Business Banking. You can see net income of $756 million on a revenue of $4.3
billion, down 1% year-on-year and sequentially.
We continue to see pressure on deposit margins. 12 basis points in the quarter and 32 year-on-year, which negatively
impact NII, but this continues to be largely offset by deposit growth. We're growing customer deposits at more than
twice the industry average, 10% year-on-year. And also in December we saw the lowest customer attrition rate we've
seen in the last 10 years. And if you take that together with the customer satisfaction results I mentioned earlier, it
speaks to the great progress we're making on the customer experience.
We're deepening relationships with average balances per account up, customer satisfaction up, transactions per debit
card up, active online and mobile customers up. And just two more revenue drivers this quarter, we had record
Business Banking loan balances of $18.9 billion with a strong pipeline and investment sales up almost 50%
year-on-year with client investment assets up 15%. And almost two-thirds of these sales are managed accounts which
generate a strong recurring source of revenue for this business. Expenses were flat quarter-on-quarter and up slightly
year-on-year driven by new branch builds.
Mortgage Banking on page 7. The overall net income for the Mortgage Bank was at $418 million and there are a couple
of significant items here this quarter which I'll take you through as we go through the results.
Moving up to the top and production, production pre-tax income of $789 million on strong originations of $51 billion,
up 33% year-on-year and 8% in the quarter which reflected strong refi activity as well as an increase in correspondent.
And although margins remain elevated, as we expected, we did see compression this quarter relative to the peaks of last
quarter and we do expect them to continue to normalize in 2013. Production expense this quarter includes a litigation
expense which is a part of the significant items for mortgage-related matters that we had on page 1.
Agency repurchase demands and the outstanding pipeline were both down significantly this quarter and cure rates
improved driving lower losses which resulted in a net positive $53 million for the quarter. So on servicing, net
servicing results in the portfolio at the end of the quarter include the impact of the acquisition of $70 billion of MetLife
servicing and just a reminder, it closed late in the quarter. It's high-quality agency servicing with the added benefit of
additional HARP opportunities for us.
Looking at servicing expense, you can see it includes a net charge for the IFR settlement of about $700 million which is
the balance of the significant items from mortgage-related matters. And just finally on this page, Real Estate Portfolios,
you can see pre-tax income of $812 million including net charge-offs of $417 million. Charge-offs for the quarter were
positively impacted by adjustments relating to Chapter 7 loans that we wrote down last quarter and if you back those
adjustments out, charge-offs would have been about $520 million this quarter versus $600 million last on an equivalent
basis. And the improvement was driven by lower home equity delinquencies.

Looking at the whole year, we saw significant improvement in charge-offs, driven by a 20% to 30% decline in
delinquencies and to a lesser extent improving house prices. We expect these positive trends to continue next year but
not necessarily at the same pace as this. And given these trends, we released $700 million of loan reserves this quarter,
which is also a significant item. And going forward, you can expect quarterly net charge-offs of $550 million plus or
minus going forward.
On page 8, we'll talk just for a minute on the IFR settlement. The settlement requires us to make a cash payment of
about $750 million and also provide modifications, short sales, and other relief commitments of $1.2 billion. In terms
of the earnings impact, we're booking a current period charge, but we're going to see significant future run rate savings.
And here's how you can think about this. In 2012, our run rate expense for the IFR was between $100 million and $150
million a quarter, and we expected this to continue at these levels or even higher throughout 2013.
These costs will now be eliminated almost immediately, and the remaining work completed by the end of the month. If
you exclude both the net settlement costs and also the IFR run rate costs, our servicing expenses would've been around
$725 million this quarter, which is obviously still very high relative to our longer-term guidance of $300 million to
$350 million a quarter, but we expect that to continue to trend down. And we don't expect any additional costs
associated with the settlement in 2013. We already have many programs in place to help borrowers, and these are fully
in our reserves.
Moving on to Card, Merchant Services and Auto on page 9, net income of $840 million, down 20% year on year and
12% quarter-on-quarter on revenue of $4.8 billion, flat year on year and up slightly quarter on quarter. We saw strong
sales volume again in Card, up 9% year on year. The revenue rate you see of 12.82% reflects strong interchange
revenue and merchant processing fees and low revenue reversals on the strong credit performance. And our merchant
processing volumes were up 17% year on year.
The net charge-off rate you see of 3.5% is down slightly quarter on quarter and down 79 basis points year on year, and
we believe we're at or we're near the bottom here. We took no reserve actions this quarter, but there may be some
additional reserve releases in the first half of 2013.
On Auto, originations up 12% year over year but down 13% quarter on quarter due to seasonality. And a final note on
expenses, our fourth quarter expenses were elevated due to the impairment of an asset related to a non-strategic
partnership.
Slide 10 and 11 and the Corporate and Investment Bank. Strong results here for a fourth quarter, net income of $2
billion on revenue of $7.6 billion for the quarter, which included DVA of $567 million which is in the credit
adjustments line item. And for clarity going forward, in addition to DVA, this line item will also include CVA and
related hedges. So if you focus on the numbers ex DVA, $2.4 billion of net income on $8.2 billion of revenue, up 19%
year on year and down 4% quarter on quarter. And just a reminder, our new reporting here reflects how we manage our
clients. The traditional banking relationships are in Banking, and investor clients in Markets and Investor Services. And
we'll talk more about these segments at Investor Day.
Total Banking revenue of $3.2 billion is up 29% year on year, driven by higher IB fees of $1.7 billion in the quarter, up
over 50% year on year, making this the strongest fee quarter this year and including record debt underwriting fees.
Total Markets and Investor Services revenue of $5 billion, up 14% year on year, driven by markets revenues of $4.1
billion, up 19% year on year and down 15% quarter on quarter. And just to remind you, this is in line with the better
end of guidance we gave you at Goldman Sachs.
It was a solid quarter for fixed income, up 21% year on year, down 15% quarter on quarter across products. Reminder,
the impact of the remaining synthetic credit portfolio is included here in the fixed income results and was a modest loss
again this quarter. Progress continues to be made derisking this position.
Equity markets of $895 million, up 11% year on year, down 14% quarter on quarter. The sequential change was
primarily due to seasonally slower equity derivatives with cash equities holding up well.

So just moving on to the drivers and at the bottom you can see our average CIB VaR declined to $106 million this
quarter, which is a significant reduction. And although it's not on the page on a spot basis, the VaR declined even
further reflecting lower volatility in the lookback period and also the risk reduction in synthetic credit. We also had
record assets under custody of $18.8 trillion, up 12% on the year and record full-year TSS revenues.
The comp-to-revenue ratio ex DVA for the whole business was 27% for the quarter and 32% for the year. And both for
the quarter and the year, comp-to-revenue ratios both including and excluding DVA were basically the same for TSS,
GIB and CIB, and going forward we expect the combined business comp to revenue to be 35% plus or minus.
Just a comment on credit, trends are stable at low levels, and provisions this quarter benefited from recoveries and a
reduction in the allowance related to restructured non-performing loans.
On page 11, just before we leave CIB there's a few metrics: number one rank in Global IB fees; number one fixed
income markets revenue share through the third quarter of this year; number one ranking from Institutional Investor for
All-American Fixed Income and Equity Research. And we've also made progress in our international expansion in the
last couple of years. International loans and assets under custody up 50% and 33% respectively since 2010. And almost
half of the revenue this year for CIB was international.
Commercial Banking on page 12. This year was the third consecutive year of record revenue and net income for this
business. The quarter saw net income of $692 million, up 8% percent year on year and flat quarter on quarter on record
revenue of $1.7 billion and record loan balances. Fed Data shows we're growing our loan balances faster than the
industry average with C&I loan growth up 18% and record middle market loan balances for the 11th consecutive
quarter, up 14%. We continued to see competitive pricing pressure but spreads remained stable this quarter. And lastly,
we continued to see strong credit performance this quarter.
Asset Management, page 13, continued strong investment performance and long-term inflows drove the third
consecutive year of record revenue. For the quarter, net income of $483 million, up 60% year-on-year and 9%
quarter-on-quarter, on record revenue of $2.8 billion. Strong results this quarter driven by higher performance fees and
improving markets and net inflows of $32 billion driving AUM growth. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of
long-term net inflows for this business.
Other positive trends included loan growth, up $20 billion year-on-year, driven by both mortgage and international
growth, and average deposits of $134 billion, up 10%. Expenses up 11% year-on-year due to higher comp expense but
the pre-tax margin of 29% was also up.
Moving on to page 14 and Corporate and Private Equity. Overall net income of close to $500 million for the quarter
included Private Equity net income of $50 million, principally from gains on sales. Treasury and CIO had a net loss of
$157 million which included negative NII due to the low rate environment and limited reinvestment opportunities
which was partially offset by about $200 million of net securities gains and mark to market. Excluding these gains,
Treasury and CIOs net loss was about $300 million', in line with our guidance and we're continuing to guide to a net
loss of $300 million plus or minus.
And finally, Other Corporate, net income here of just over $600 million includes $620 million of tax adjustments,
which is our final significant item. It resulted from a reduction in tax rates for the full year and also a number of
discrete items, most significantly a tax return adjustment. And although large, these items are not unusual.
The tax adjustments were partially offset by $184 million of additional litigation reserves and again, if I adjust for the
two items I just mentioned, Other Corporate net income would've been about $100 million and we continue to expect it
to run at that level, $100 million plus or minus, going forward. And remember, both Treasury CIO and Other Corporate
results are likely to vary quarter-over-quarter.
Moving on to Net Interest Margin, turn to page 15, you can see firm wide NIM declined three basis points and core
NIM seven basis points in the quarter. Of note, our NII held up this quarter and in fact, it grew, despite this
compression.

There's obviously a number of items affecting NIM, first the negatives: competitive pressure and the runoff of
higher-yielding loans drove lower loan yields across the board, lower rates in Europe drove lower investment security
yields and the low rate environment continued to impact reinvestment opportunities. On the positive: increased hedging
and a change in mix reduced the cost of our long-term debt.
Hedge accounting had a neutral impact on NIM this quarter with some offsets in assets and liabilities. And going
forward, given the environment, we continue to expect modest pressure on NIM for the next several quarters.
So just turning on page 16 our final page, the outlook, we've covered most of these items already and we'll provide
more detail on our outlook at Investor Day, but we remain optimistic about 2013 and the continuation of market share
gains, positive loan growth and improving credit trends, all contributing to our results.
So thank you for joining us and with that we'll open up the call for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, there. Thanks. So over time we've talked back-and-forth about housing improving and you
were right, and it is improving but curious if you have any metrics for us on say, what's built into the reserve models
and how – what kind of sensitivity we can have if say, let's just say hypothetically housing improves 5% in 2013 and
again in 2014. Just I don't know if you can put metrics around it, but...?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We obviously have to make some assumptions going forward on housing prices, and they're not
that different than the assumptions you would see in most other big public – like Case-Shiller, et cetera. Right now they
have a modest increase in home prices in 2013 and 2014. I'll stick with just those two years, but if it was 5% better than
that, which is possible, that would run through our books in lower charge-offs and lower reserves and I – just, as a rule
of thumb, $500 million. For one year.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Got it.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's a very rough rule of thumb.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I appreciate that. From what I understand on CCAR this year, they're going to be taking – the
Fed is going to be taking a closer look at internal stress testing and all the procedures that go around that. And I think
we're going to get to see – you're going to be disclosing some of those results. I'm not front running what we're going to
see. I'm just curious, in general, are we going see that at the same time? Are we going to see it on a lagged basis? And
what you plan on disclosing?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, no we're required under Dodd-Frank to disclose our stress tests. Remember, we do – in
March. We do it almost immediately after the Fed's report and, remember, we do hundreds. The Fed is four. So we look
at multiple kind of stress tests and we're going to try to give you a full view of how we look at the company under
stress. I should point out, that a lot of you did it yourselves in the past. You were pretty accurate, some of you.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Jamie, maybe the last one, on things related to the Orderly Liquidation Authority. I know we
haven't seen the white paper yet, but there's been a lot of back-and-forth and I'm not a believer that we're going to get
the worst-case scenario that some people at the FDIC had thought about. But long story short is, as ironic as it is, every
bank has spent the last couple of years reducing their sub debt because Basel III doesn't count it. Now, shocker, we're
going to have to issue some more because OLA's going to want it. Just curious on how much prep you can do ahead of
that and what your expectations are over – in terms of a phase-in if that's going to be impactful in the near-term?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Just to give you a view, we have $200 billion of equity and $250 billion of unsecured debt, that's
$450 billion. That's a lot of capital before anyone else bears a loss. It's not clear to me that it's subordinated versus just

unsecured and it would take time to develop those markets. If a bank has 50-50 or obviously a change of the nature a
little bit over time. So it will take time to develop, but I think we're working with the authorities to get it right, to do the
analysis right, to have the right numbers. I think you have a little time before someone says it has to be this amount.
Remember, we've got Basel I, Basel II, Basel III, OLA, LCR, NSF and this new one. And we're going to be able to
accommodate all of them, just it'll take a little bit of time. I do want to point out that we fully intend, in 2013 – late
2013, to be at 9.5% Basel III and to be fully compliant with LCR.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, great. I'm good. Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So you all are about to start buying back
stock here in the first quarter and the share price is at about $45. Ironically, this is the price point historically where
there's been an indication of some price sensitivity. So maybe, I was hoping for an update on your thinking on that
front?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, we had done – given you some numbers in our annual report last year about where it's a
no-brainer to buy back stock, which I said is tangible book value. Tangible book value is now $38 or $39. So – which
has gone up – what is it, $4 this year, almost $5 this year? So we still think if you haircut earnings and buy stock at
these prices, it's probably still a good deal. We got permission to buy back $3 billion in the first quarter. Obviously, we
– it's going to be a little price sensitive and then CCAR will set what we can buy back for the next four quarters after
that.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I hope that answered your question.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Yeah, no, I think so. So basically, your – we can look at the tangible book value
growth versus the last comments and imply from there?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You can do the same numbers at today's prices. Discount – if you want to be conservative,
discount earnings, buy back stock and at the end of a two or three year period you'll have higher earnings per share and
higher tangible book value per share, even at these prices.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It seems like a pretty good deal to me. Particularly if you have a good company.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And you're not going to need the capital down the road. I'm not talking about for one year, but
down the road.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Fair enough. And then the $100 million to $150 million that's coming out of your legacy
costs, is that part of that $500 million per quarter that you all have highlighted in the past or is that in addition to that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. Think, Brennan, about it is as all in and we're expecting our run rate in the future to be I
think $300 million to $350 million, as I said. Excluding the items we talked about including IFR we're at $725 million.
We've got a ways to go, but it's coming down. Think about it as in there.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Good deal. And then the comp ratio in CIB is down this year or I should say maybe
full year 2012 about 2.5 percentage points from year prior. How should we think about the comp ratio in the IB on a
going forward basis? I mean have we hit a structural shift here?

<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, I think – let me just point out first off that our comp rate was 33%. If you, by the way, if
you added back some of the bonuses paid at corporate that don't show up as comp in the IB it would be like 35%. We
think that around this number is kind of an ongoing run rate. We've got – we have formulas. We don't pay out by –
necessarily by the formula, but we have formulas that are capital adjusted, risk-adjusted, et cetera, et cetera that – that's
what really guides it. And it is not – so it is really done at a much more detailed level and it'll bounce around that 35%.
I should point out that, again, we feel good that ROE in the Investment Bank was 17% this year. It was 16% or 17%
last year and the year before, and we're paying our people fair and well. I feel good about that. That's a good thing.
That's a good business model to have something like that.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure. But probably on the whole, upward comp pressure across the Street competitively is
probably nowhere near as it had been, so improvements and increased cost leverage is probably decently sustainable,
wouldn't you say?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yes. I think that's probably true, but other firms have ratios, 50%, 55%. Ours is already fairly
low.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We want to win in the business so we're going to be competitive in compensation and obviously
that'll adjust over time with – as competition changes.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then last one for me, as we start to move forward towards the central clearing of
swaps here late in the first quarter of 2013, do you have – maybe have an updated view of what this transition might
mean for JPMorgan's FICC business or your capital markets revenues for 2013?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: At Investor Day we'll try to give you a better view of that, so there are clearly some negatives
and we don't know all the rules. There are also some positives so we're in a position between custody and clearing and
our brokerage businesses to provide some of those services to – for investors, they can allocate capital properly,
transform the collateral and serve them better. So let the rules come out. Obviously, this is going to affect our revenues
a bit, but there'll be opportunities there too.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Terrific. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Hey, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Question on LCR. Jamie, you mentioned that you were going to be looking to be 100%
compliant by the end of 2013. And I wanted to understand, did the Basel release on LCR align with your sense of how
it's going to shake out in the U.S.? And I ask because the RMBS looks like it was very tightly worded. So I wondered if
there's any caveats to your comment that you'll hit 100% by year-end.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No. Here's my caveat. We are going to meet LCR this year, whatever it is. It doesn't matter to us
whether we like it or not. Now to answer your question, there was some changes in LCR. I think they were good, but
they still capped the benefit like mortgages and we have like almost $90 billion MBS. So government guaranteed MBS
is in what they call level II and therefore you're restricted in how much counts for liquidity. Now I – personally, I think
that's wrong, but it's okay. We'll live with it. We're moving on.
I don't know why the American regulators would agree to that. I mean government guaranteed MBS in a market you
want, where they are treated as liquid and remember they already have a 15% haircut. I could argue they don't need any
haircut, but look whether changes are made or not we're going to be compliant. It's not going to affect our earnings that

much.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just separately a small item, but on mortgages, you talked about the gain on
sale that came down in the quarter and that you're looking forward to that normalizing over the course of the next year
or so. Could you just give us a sense of how much we're talking about normalizing because we could go back to
pre-crisis and that has a much bigger implication on mortgage revenues than if you're talking about just before the long
end of the curve started to come down dramatically.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So hey, Betsy. We talked about the third quarter being – peaking at over 200 basis points. We
saw the margins compressing some 40 or so basis points in the quarter and we do expect that to continue in 2013 – not
at that level. If you go back in time you would see again with our margins more in the 65 basis points. I don't know if
that's where it ends but certainly we expect for that to be a theme through 2013 but with gaining market share we hope
to keep our volumes up, so...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: My own feeling is, obviously it'll normalize over time but it may not go that low because our
expenses are also going to be permanently higher. So to be in the business is going to cost more money. And obviously
that'll part of your – what you have to earn back.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. I get it. Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Ed Najarian of ISI Group.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Yeah, Jamie, quick question. Any update with respect to how quickly you expect your Basel
III risk-weighted assets to decline? We saw a little bit of a decline this quarter. Expecting more decline, but is there,
sort of, any change in the outlook for the pace of that decline or how you're thinking about it?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, so we – the number that Marianne showed you, the Basel III Tier 1 common was 8.7%. If
you look at what I call for the next two years passive mitigation – that's runoff and what I call normal models so we
still have to get certain models in there – and this is not arguing with anybody – just models that should be put in place
– that would add almost 1% to Basel right off the bat. About – I'm going to say $100 billion of that would be models.
$80 billion to $100 billion would be models. Part of that's the run-off of synthetic credit, which is obviously coming
down over time, so – and the other thing which I think you're going to see is we're pushing Basel III down – we have,
but we're pushing it down at a very detailed level. I think over time you'll see us drive down capital – Basel RWA even
more.
And there are things in Basel which I don't know what the future portends. We have $200 billion plus of operational
RWA in there now. That's driven very – and that's like $16 billion of capital. That's driven very high by obviously the
mortgage litigation and stuff like that, some of which will go away. So one day a lot – that $200 billion should come
down a lot, too. I just don't know the timetable for that.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up to that. You mentioned wanting get to 9.5% by the end
of 2013...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No, I didn't mention – we are going to get there late in 2013, whatever it takes.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay. Along with that, we see a number of companies sort of building a little bit of – 50 basis
points or something like that – as sort of a buffer on the buffer to account for AOCI fluctuation and things like that. For
you guys, maybe getting up to 10% or wherever the ultimate endpoint is, is that more of a 2014 event? Or is that also
something that you would like to get done this year?

<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're going to answer – to give you more feedback – maybe we have to have a buffer. We don't
know what the final rules are for capital. So you already have a conservation buffer. If you go below what happens?
Obviously OCI could be a big swing like if you model it – I forgot – we had modeled it like 300 basis points would be
$20 billion after tax or something like that, but you could handle that too, because it's going to come in over time. And
you can manage your balance sheet going forward, your stock buyback going forward. So we really need to see the
future rules to make that determination. If we need a buffer, we'll have a buffer.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Whatever that is, we're going to go there right away, too, but we just don't know what it is yet.
And we don't know whether CCAR's going to drive capital or the conservation buffer's going to drive capital or
whatever. And we don't know how the GSIFI exactly works, even though we know it's a 2.5%, we'll probably find
ways to reduce that over time. So we have plenty of capital. Right now far more than I personally think we need but we
have plenty of capital.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Well, I think everyone's trying to do math on how much capital you might return this year, so
all of those are – questions are...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, unfortunately that's a one-year thing, okay. And I should point out that – before you ask, is
that when we started the dividends, we said that the intent would be to increase them a little bit every year so you
should expect to see that. We're going to ask for less capital return from stock buyback than we have in the past. So I
can do $3 billion in the first quarter. We're going to do less because we've determined and this is a board-level
determination, too – that we want to get to 9.5% quicker and we don't exactly know how these stress tests work.
So we think under severe stress we'd have plenty of capital, but last time the Fed's numbers were very different. We
don't understand that so the way CCAR was done this year has even more volatility. Basel 2.5 is far more volatile in
how you calculate RWA, OCI and all that than the old Basel I test. So we're being a little cautious, which I think is
what, obviously, the Fed expected people to do.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Erika Penala of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Good morning. Some of the pushback that I've gotten from some investors on your strong quarter
is on the provision rules overall. But I guess I want to follow up with Glenn's question because clearly CIB is
unsustainable from a provision basis, but it seems like there's still a lot of leverage left on the provision side from CCB.
So, Jamie, was your comment that if house prices were up 5% over what's in your model, the additional leverage from
provision is $500 million per year?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, let me just separate the two. In Consumer, credit card is near the end. There could be more,
but it's near the end. It's really Mortgage. Mortgage reserves are going to have to come down as charge-offs come
down, and charge-offs are going to come down. Okay? That's not – we're not trying to manipulate earnings or anything
like that. They are going to come down. The portfolios are smaller, housing prices are going up. We just don't know
exactly the pace that they're going to come down. But remember, they're half of what they were a year and a half ago,
and my guess is in a year and a half or two from now they'll be half of what they are today, which implies that reserves
will come down. We have $5 billion left; that'd imply it'll be $2.5 billion. So there's nothing magical there. That's
what's in the numbers. It's really a matter of timing, et cetera.
And on the CIB side, it was really – we had one or two big recoveries, so we did have, what was it, $400 million? But
Marianne also pointed out there's some other negatives that could book to the CIB, too. So you're right, we're not going
to have much reserve takedown in CIB, but the other negatives won't be there either. So it's a little bit of a wash in CIB
too, from other non-reserve-related stuff.

<Q - Erika Penala>: Got it. And in terms of CIB activity levels, I think that the investor base did expect some strength
this quarter, more than seasonal. I guess, could you give us a sense of whether or not the strong fourth quarter showing
is sort of a harbinger for activity levels finally picking up in 2013?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I wouldn't call it a strong fourth quarter showing. And we kind of made an assumption that the
last two weeks of the year are pretty dead in terms of activity, and we were a little bit wrong about that.
But here's what I'd say. And activity now is continuing – it's usually strong in the first part of the year. We don't know.
But I personally believe that this has been, and I've been consistent about this, a cyclical, not a secular, change. We deal
with 16,000 investors. Investable assets are going up; they're not going down. Global trade is going up, it's not going
down. High net worth assets, I'm talking over 10 years. And so, there's a need that people have to buy and sell
securities, et cetera. So I think the underlying trend is up, and obviously spreads will compress over time. They have,
by the way, for 20 years, and that'll continue. And now we've got a bunch of model changes, not models, but like
business model changes from swaps and derivatives and regulations. And we'll adjust to all of that.
But there's a chance you're going to wake up one day and it'll be a boomer year. And no one is going to predict that,
either. There's a chance, if we happen to go into recession, that it'll get worse. But my attitude is, I think we're very well
positioned in the business. It's very broad-based between FX, rates, credit, securitized products, commodities. It's very
global, Emerging Markets, driven by research, which as Marianne mentioned, we're number one. So over time it'll
grow. I just can't predict what it's going to do next quarter.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Okay. And I just wanted to sneak one more in on Card. We appreciate the color on sales volume
in Card, and I think there's a thesis out there that if the U.S. consumer is taking home less because taxes are higher, but
the underlying economy is okay, then that could potentially translate into receivables growth finally. Is that a
reasonable leap to make as we look at receivables growth for next year?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yes. Look, I think the American economy, I would say the table is rather well set. Consumers,
businesses, housing and small businesses, they're all in pretty good shape. And I think we need good policy and good
fiscal policy, yes. So we expect to see – we've had, which I think you mentioned, we've had runoff in consumer too.
Remember we – in Card, from WaMu and some other stuff, and we're running off certain businesses and certain things
we got out of. But you can start to see a little bit of growth now going forward in outstandings. Good growth in
spending, a little bit of growth in outstandings.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Got it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yes, hi. Marianne, it looks like your adjusted expenses ex litigation and IB comp
came in around $49 billion or so for the year. Do you have an outlook for this number in 2013? Are you looking for
some improvement in that above and beyond what you saved from the foreclosure settlement?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so hi, John. We'll do that for you at Investor Day in a lot of detail. I think the way to think
about our adjusted expenses going forward, you should think about them being flat to down in terms of direction, and
we'll go through all of that for you in February.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Is that the right number, like flat to down from around that $49 billion or so level?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, around $50 billion.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Okay. And then that excludes litigation. It looks like litigation for the full year
came in around $3.7 billion. That's down from $4.5 billion the year before. Do you expect that trend of declining
litigation expense in 2013?

<A - Jamie Dimon>: One day, we hope.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We don't, yes, we won't, we can't predict the litigation expense, I'm sorry.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Not clear yet. Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The one part I do want to reiterate is that obviously that one's going to be lumpy and could be
ongoing, except the part relating to mortgages and we've done a lot of work on and we're hoping that we're properly
reserved there and we're not going to see a duplication of that. And the last couple of years of litigation, a lot have
related to mortgages. Not all of it but a lot of it.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And then on the buybacks, the first quarter is usually a big issuance quarter for you on
shares but knowing you have approval for $3 billion of gross repurchases, do you expect to have a net reduction in your
share count by the end of the first quarter?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You got me there. I think when the – if we buy back $3 billion and what we issue, I think what
we issue amortizes in over time as we issue it so my guess is it will go down a little bit in the first quarter. When you
issue restricted stock, it doesn't immediately go into fully diluted. That goes in as it amortizes. And remember this stuff
amortizes over three years, generally.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So in 2012, your share count didn't go down. That's because you suspended the
buybacks but it didn't do enough in the first quarter to take the share count down. I assume you'd like to see it decrease
at some level?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: If we spend the whole three billion, my guess is it will down, yes.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And then when you say you're going to ask for less, just to clarify, you mean you'll
ask for less than $3 billion per quarter?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yes.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Last thing, on risk weighted assets, it looks like your assets were up 2%, but
Basel III RWA came down. What drove that delta? Are we starting to see the mitigation take effect?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, I think John, in part that's it. I can get back to you with more specific details, it did come
down slightly in the quarter. It does reflect the combination of our full understanding of all the rules plus some model
changes and everything else in the quarter and BAU activity, but we can you more details.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And one more thing. Your net interest income grew in the fourth quarter
despite the NIM headwinds and the runoff. And I understand your NIM percentage outlook, but I guess what helped
you grow NII dollars this quarter? And do you think you can grow NII dollars in 2013?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, I mean, so we're continuing to grow our deposits very strongly. We're continuing to
grow our loans very strongly, so core loan growth up 9%, so all in all we're generally holding pace with NIM
compression and hope to do the same next year, plus or minus.

<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Just first, a factual question. How much were fourth quarter performance fees in Asset
Management?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: They was better by over $100 million versus the fourth quarter last year.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then -
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The fourth quarter of last year wasn't particularly good, by the way, so...
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. My main question is, does the CIO incident change how JPMorgan is run? And as you
said, you've had record net income, 15% return on tangible equity. I think you've said in the past, someone at JPMorgan
at least implied that the CIO incident shouldn't change things. On the other hand, you had the new cease-and-desist
orders, regulatory actions by the Fed and the OCC, and this change in reporting format is the most radical that's ever
been put in place since, Jamie, you've been CEO. And then all the changes in management. You have a new head of
Consumer, Commercial, Investment Bank, International, CFO, CIO. So on the one hand, you highlighted the record net
income. I guess my question goes to sustainability of the results over the next several years, given how many people
have changed, the change in reporting format and the regulatory action. Maybe it's like if you're driving on the Long
Island Expressway and you get a ticket for going 80 miles per hour and then you drive 50 miles an hour. Is that just
completely off?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Completely off. Let me tell you where – you raised a lot of subjects so let me do them one by
one. Obviously when you have a problem like "the whale," you have mistakes, which you should acknowledge and
then fix. So we obviously fixed CIO totally, 100%. People in it, reporting, risk, controls, committees, guidelines and we
don't do synthetic credit there at all. Okay? But some of those mistakes obviously scared us, and we wanted to check
everywhere in the company.
So we're fixing certain things across the company. Not that they're bad, they're not disasters, but they require fixing.
And so when you have an accident like that, you want to say, we're going to use this to get stronger, better, smarter,
tougher. And we have to and we're going to obviously meet every demand of the regulators. So we've got real resources
doing it. We've already done a lot of it. We're going to continue to do more, so yeah, there were changes from "the
whale."
Number two, we're in business to build the business over time by serving clients. That's what we do. We do it every –
we take risks, you take risk when you make loans, you take risk when you invest money, you take risk when you build
systems and branches. But that's what we've been doing consistently, and I hope you see in the underlying numbers,
more branches, more bankers, more custody, more trading, more products, more services, more countries, happier
clients. In every business. Record results in Commercial Banking, Asset Management. A lot of cross-sell in that, and
we're going to do a lot more to describe to you the competitive benefits that we get in this company, because the
different business units work together and things like that.
So that part of the business hasn't changed. That's why we're here. Even CIO has always been doing that, investing
assets conservatively, both – because I was watching something on TV today to earn a return – you have to earn a
return on your assets. The thought that you're not going to try to earn a return on your assets is ludicrous to me, and to
manage asset liability exposure, generally conservatively. We obviously made a mistake.
And the third thing, the reorganization, that was around – and I want to do a lot of this for you – around the client. That
was – if you said rebuild the company from the ground up, you probably would've organized it around the clients, not
necessarily by product. It's not that we were bad or banks were bad or anything like that, it's that companies acquired
mortgage companies, they acquired credit card companies, they acquired retail branches. The power of that franchise is
extraordinary. 40% of our retail branches own credit cards that are our credit cards today. Okay? A big chunk of our
mortgage sales come out of the branches. Most of our small business is served out of the branches. Middle market is
served out of the branches. The branches are becoming an enormous competitive advantage for Asset Management.
The Commercial Bank couldn't survive without them.

So all we did is say, put together those businesses under one roof where you want to have – you want to treat the client
the way they want to be treated when they come in the front door. Same thing for CIB. The same client set in the
investor side and the issuer side, the corporate side. So we go to any country, we serve the big companies, we serve the
sovereign wealth funds, we serve the governments. We serve them out of TSS and we serve them out of the Investment
Bank. All we're doing here is better coordination, which we think will have more cross-sell and, believe it or not, lower
expenses. Plus, it'll help us deal with the new regulatory environment, so both of these things are going to help us deal
with the new regulatory environment to have consistent standards across all of the business, et cetera. So that's why we
had the reorg.
And management changes, you went through the litany of changes. But just remember, Daniel Pinto has been in that
business his whole life, Mike Cavanagh has been here for many years and was already running TSS. Doug Petno has
been running the Commercial Bank for several years now. Gordon Smith and Todd Maclin, we did a little bit fast when
we told people. We told people we were going to put that under one roof. Marianne Lake has been the Controller of the
IB and the CFO of the Consumer Bank. All the people in these jobs have been here a long time, and they're very good.
I mean, I think it's an exceptional management team. It is too much turnover. But again, the way I look at the turnover,
if I have 15 people on the Operating Committee, you should assume that 15% to 20% every year will turn over. Some
years will be zero, and some years it'll be more. When you have reorgs and stuff like that, it's a little bit more.
Hopefully we're going to have stability. We've got a great management team. They're working on a lot of different
things. Most have been here a long time.
And part of it, part of it relates to – remember if you were on my Board of Directors, you would be asking me – in fact
instructing me to make sure you were putting in place, in the big jobs, the people who have to be tested to see if they
could do my job. That is – I mentioned this many years ago – that is job number one. That takes precedence over all
other things. So sometimes it leads to turnover, I'm sorry.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I guess we'll hear more at Investor Day next month. But what are you watching for, since there's
so much rotation among top managers around the same time. What are you looking for to ensure that this current team
will work?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, look, I – you don't know – you should get to know them, but you can evaluate their quality,
their integrity, their brains. Remember, Mary Erdoes has been here a long time. Matt Zames, who's now Co-Chief
Operating Officer, Frank Bisignano have both been here a long time. So these are long-tenured, very good, respected
employees, and so I know it's going to work. Obviously you have to make that evaluation yourself.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. Then last follow up. Does your positioning to ask for less than $3 billion per quarter in
buybacks have anything to do with the regulatory actions that recently came about?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Not really, but the CCAR does have this qualitative aspect, which is – I don't exactly know what
that means but not really. It really related more to the desire – the stock price is higher and the desire to get to 9.5%
quicker.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Everyone's been doing it, and obviously, we shouldn't lag. That's all.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: And also, Mike Mayo, because you had me do a little work after one of your reports came out
about stock price, so do this yourself. Take Bank One's stock price from the day before I got there to today and take
JPMorgan's stock price from the day we announced the deal to today, compare it to the S&P, the bank index or all other
major firms, and it's actually rather good, and it outperformed both cases the bank index by a long shot. In both cases
the S&P, not by a long shot but by a significant margin, and almost most other financial companies. So obviously
something's been working a little bit here.
Opportunities – I think the opportunities are fabulous. So next year we're going to focus a tremendous amount on
regulatory requirements, these consent orders, getting things done, but also just organic growth. Small business,
Marianne mentioned, is up almost everywhere, partially in Florida and California where WaMu gave us the opportunity
to do that. We opened our 1,000th branch in California. We're still going to open net over 100 branches this year.
Our credit card has been growing. The Chase Private Client, we've gone from 250 branches to 1,200 Chase Private
Client. That number is going to go up and I don't know if you – I don't know if that's public. Okay now it's public. It's
something like 2,000 end of next year. It's really working, so it's growing dramatically. Our mutual fund complex has
been growing. TS&S the global, actually not TS&S, the Global Corporate Bank has opened multiple branches overseas.
We've gone from 120 Global Corporate Bankers to 286 or something. It's going to be north of 300 and it's working. If
you look at investment banking revenues out of the Commercial Bank, when we first got here we talked I think it was
like $450 million, this year it hit almost $2 billion and we think the opportunity to continue to grow is large.
So in almost every single business we see very good opportunities to grow and obviously we operate in a difficult
world of financial services but the Investment Bank has been – Marianne went through the numbers, but we don't see
why you can't continue to grow that around the world and serve more clients in more places like Colombia or some of
the emerging markets. You know, in Commercial Banking we opened branches in non – states we don't have branches,
which have been focused on kind of larger clients and international. That's working well. International Commercial
Bank is working well and all these numbers are in here. You and I should go through it soon. They're all pretty good.
And you're going to see us continue to focus on growing those businesses in a quality way.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Just as a separate issue, you've obviously responded to the orders from both the OCC and the
Fed. Are there any kind of impacts while those are out there until they kind of deemed them to be kind of fully dealt
with and what's the timeframe for that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, I think you should look at we're already fully engaged in meeting all of those consents and
other regulatory demands. Remember we have changing rules and requirements. We also have a lot of items that the
regulators have asked us to focus on, the consent orders. So yes it's a tremendous amount of resource but it's not going
to change numbers you see. It's just the people involved, a lot of people involved in risk, credit, legal compliance, audit,
HR all are really involved in getting a lot of this stuff right and we have to do that, of course, and people in the business
too, of course.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning. A couple of questions in the Mortgage Banking business and as you think
about the mortgage asset. The first one is, what's your appetite either now or as you look forward to actually
portfolio-ing some of the mortgages you originate?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so, Matt, you will have seen that we pretty much portfolio all the jumbos we originate
right now. We price them to great returns and we would continue to do that. We like that asset. I think overall across
the firm we did $5 billion of jumbos this quarter and so you should expect to see that continue.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: One of the things you learn to live with a little bit is that you could put a mortgage on your
balance sheet and earn 375 or 4 if it's jumbo or something like that – it doesn't have OCI. It holds more capital but it
might be a wiser thing to do than taking the gain on sale and then buying an MBS at 2.25. So there are all these
opportunities to think through how to manage in the new world properly both for the client and for the shareholder.
And that's – go ahead.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: That's really where I was getting to because I think you have one of the shorter MBS books
out there. Obviously you have a strong mortgage origination platform and as we strip out the legacy residential
mortgages what you're left with is not a huge number. So just trying to gauge what the appetite might be there to...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It may be – and that may change over time and get bigger. So we are doing a little bit more and
right now it's the jumbos. We've done a little bit like C-pluses and stuff like that but there may be others.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then maybe somewhat related, as we think about just the underwriting standards
in the mortgage business...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I should point also that we would much prefer loans than securities. Like in Commercial Bank,
Credit Card, et cetera. So the reason we have securities is because we can't generate that kind of loans right now.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: As we think about underwriting standards in the mortgage business, we can see the average
FICO scores that the banks do collectively that Fannie or Freddie back still quite high. There's been some good
progress with dealing with the legacy issues not just for JP Morgan but for the industry as a whole, got the new guides
from the CFPB, home prices going up. What else do we need to see for banks to loosen underwriting standards in
mortgage a bit?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think that QRM was a really big start and well thought through but it also needs to coordinated
with Basel III, some these NPR rules, this whole thing about OCI. So all these things are going to affect mortgage little
bit and a lot of players involved in that who have to coordinate it. So – but I do think over time it'll open up the
mortgage markets. How rep and warranty is going to be handled, et cetera.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: QRM, skin in the game. I think securitization will be important. So if I was the government I'd
want to get QRM and securitization rules fixed as quickly as I can to allow people to start.

Our next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning. Maybe a question for Marianne. Marianne, I noticed that the global liquidity
balance was up about $50 billion quarter-over-quarter to just a little bit under $500 billion. Is that in line with your
guidance that you're going to meet the LCR requirements by the end of the year or is there something else going on
there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, Matt, I would say that's broadly in line with that. We have excess cash and excess capacity
at central banks and that's what that reflects.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: They're two different numbers but they move in same direction.

Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning. Could you tell us what the duration of the securities portfolio
is?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We do break it out.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We disclose it but we haven't disclosed it for the fourth quarter.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: What was it last time?
<A - Marianne Lake>: 1.3.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So it's like interest duration. So it's probably about the same.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And I may have missed it – I may have missed this so I apologize...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The other thing – the important – I think the way look at those are – we would benefit from rising
rates. So I've always said that that portfolio is subordinated to the interest of the company. It's very short. You could
extend that duration to earn a lot more income but then we'd be hurt by rising rates. So and we break out that, the
earnings at risk from rising rates if the whole curve goes up 100 basis points is about a $2 billion plus pre-tax. And that
comes through the investment portfolio and loan repricing, et cetera.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: How much would you estimate at the long end of the curve would you need to see the long
end of the curve go up to mitigate the margin pressures so that you could actually see maybe margins not go down?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I can't – offhand it's hard for me to say that, but I think I'm going to guess, but it's like 30, 40
basis points. It's not a lot to neutralize it. To just eliminate – right. Something like that.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Correct. No. I agree. Yep. The other question and I apologize if you guys already gave this
answer, but what was the gain on sale of mortgages this quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The margin?
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Or the dollar amount?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I think it's so – I think it's in the supplement. I'm afraid I – yes.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We've got to get back – it is in the production revenue.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. It's in production revenue which I think was close to $800 million.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: And the – what was the spread? Like 3% or – the revenue spread?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No. Revenue was over – was 3, 3.5.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So it's like 3.5 times 50. Actually it's unclosed, not a...
<A - Marianne Lake>: We can do that. We'll do the math for you.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And then coming back to the return of capital, Jamie, I know there is a stock price
you're not going to want to buy back your stock. I'm not asking for that stock price. But let's assume for a moment,
bank stocks do well this year. Your stock gets to that level where you're not real comfortable in buying it back. Would
you guys consider as the excess capital builds up on the balance sheet and the Fed limits your regular dividend to
maybe 30% of earnings, would you consider special dividends as an avenue to give back that excess capital if you feel
it's not – you're not comfortable buying back the stock at the price at some future level?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yes. Well, first of all, it's a board level decision and in some ways it's a nice problem to have.
But the way you set the question up, you almost have no option. If you can't buy back stock and you can't raise your
dividend, all you have left is something like that. So we'll get there when we get there. Again we need to see all the new
rules and how we're going to apply like this conservation buffer. We may know more by Investor Day but when we
know more we'll let you know.

Our next question comes from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Yes. Good morning. A couple of questions. First one, on the latest reorganization, I
guess that comes really in the light of having completed the integration of both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. It
makes complete sense. But have you actually set any targets in terms of the – both the revenue and cost synergies you
think you might achieve in the medium-term? That's the first question.
And the second one was on the $80 billion to $100 billion of RWA you think you can shed by reworking your models.
Something, ironically, you've been pretty critical about in the past in terms of the European's view on that. But can you
just tell me, is it getting more difficult to do that in the market we're in at the moment when we are getting some
pushback from Basel on some of the risk-weighted asset calculations or are you finding it pretty straightforward to
actually negotiate that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yes. So the first one is obviously we do budgets and stuff. We put targets in place about things
we'd like to accomplish. So that's in our numbers – how we look at it. We're not going to disclose it to you, but I did
say that we do think it's going to enhance revenue and reduce expenses a little bit. So the little bit that's in there for the
CIB and a little bit in there for consumer. And we're going to disclose more at Investor Day about cross-sell and how
we look at it and where we think we can benefit, et cetera.
And if you look at risk-weighted assets we're up to – our balance sheet is $2.4 trillion. Okay? We've got $200 billion of
money deposited at central banks around the world or in repo, very short-term investments, $350 billion in AA
securities and $400 billion in securities borrowed or resales. We have a really, really liquid balance sheet. I just
mentioned $750 billion, almost $1 trillion of very short-term stuff that's sitting there on our balance sheet on the asset
side and our risk-weighted assets are now $1.65 trillion. Okay?
They've gone up dramatically because of Basel 2.5. Some – the fact we don't have certain models in place, but we
accept it. So some of the benefit arguably is just going to be – I'm going to call it run off. Some is from models that
regulators expect people to design and put in place that we don't have yet. We either don't have the history or we
haven't done the modeling. And that's most of – a lot of this around credit related, synthetic credit type stuff,

securitizations and things like that. So we're going to put those in place and that's not arguing with regulators. They
would expect us to do that over time. Obviously, regulators – I know they're going to look at how people do models
around the world and they want it done fairly, et cetera.

Our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: I wanted to ask a detailed question about the mortgage repurchase expense. You were
able to show this quarter that you had a reduction in the reserve of $249 million and only experienced $196 million of
losses. So you actually met – brought down the impact there, and in your outlook, you talked about being able to offset
future losses with release of reserves. So I wanted to ask that question first. And I have one more follow up after that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Sure. So to think about repurchase. Both sides of that, we do them separately, so repurchase
losses I told you will see demands down significantly, you will see the outstanding pipeline down significantly. We've
seen cure rates improve, so I realize off this sub $200 million and it is what it is and it's a factor, a feature of activity
obviously and it can vary a little. On the repurchase reserve side, it's obviously model driven and we use inputs
including things like cure rates, so it's not going to be a perfect offset. In this quarter it happens to be slightly more and
over time, over the next few quarters we think they could largely offset but you might see some small pluses or
minuses.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: So we should see, we've kind of gone through an inflection point here where you think
the demands are coming down in improvement of what you're seeing overall, that that drain should be somewhat
mitigated going forward?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. And I would say that we're in constant dialogue with the agencies and you know
obviously people ask about behavior and we're in constant dialogue. We think we understand the direction it's going.
We feel good about where we are right now and you know we'll continue to monitor that.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then as we look into 2013, I was trying to take a little bit of your outlook and just
kind of create a net progression. If you look at the $1 billion that you basically highlighted in margin compression, you
have a natural offset that you've explained in the servicing expenses of about $400 million. So if you take your current
run rate of operating of $1.35, annualize that to $5.40, you've probably got somewhere between $0.07 and $0.10 worth
of negative that comes out of that from netting out the positive that you have in the servicing expenses from margin
compression.
If you then move incrementally for growth, if you offset a lot of the margin compression with loan and deposit growth,
then you're being able to generate about $1 billion of incremental just growth in overall balance sheet. If you look at
expenses savings and then some reduction in shares, you can kind of look at how you would layer in towards, you
know, something like 10% kind of growth next year as you kind of mirror those kind of big moving pieces. So, just
want to make sure we're tracking those and if you had any other thoughts about incremental opportunities to create EPS
next year?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: There's a lot of stuff to respond to there. I think you can call later and get a little more feedback
about some of the stuff you said, call Sarah Youngwood at Investor Relations. But you went through a lot of the stuff
that's accurate. You know, obviously we're in an environment, the environment changes all the time but we have
growth plans everywhere. So it isn't like we're sitting on our laurels and just looking at, you know what's going on,
NIM compression and stuff like that. So, yes, we expect to grow earnings next year. We may be wrong, but that's what
we expect.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then I guess, Jamie, the bottom line is that you have product growth to offset margin
compression but then you've got share repurchase and some efficiencies to create incremental growth. I guess that's the

Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning. Can you give us an update on where you are on the synthetic portfolio? I
know you probably don't want to give a dollar amount, but is it mostly gone and what the timeframe is of that, even if
it's a modest drag, just having off the books completely?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's – I think we had said earlier on July 13, we hoped it would be almost a non-issue by the end
of the year. I think we're getting there. I think from the day, and we're not going to give you any more detail than I'm
about to tell you, so don't ask. We had a modest loss in the fourth quarter. There's no reason to have any losses going
forward. The risk from the day the Investment Bank got it, and they've done a good job continuing to de-risk it, are
down I'm going to say another 50%. So obviously there's still risk. It's still a portfolio that has got the average duration,
I'm going to say is 2, 2.5 years left, so if you did nothing, you know, it's going to diminish dramatically over time. But
we – I think we've got it well-controlled at this point. There could be some volatility because of the nature of it. It's got
some idiosyncratic exposures in there but we think we're fine. We don't think it's anything that anyone needs to worry
about anymore.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe on the deposit growth. I think you were up on a
period end basis $54 billion. Is there any way to kind of get a sense of how much of that is sticky? Or was that just sort
of fiscal cliff concerns? Or was it the TAG, the TAG-related deposits? Do you have any sense on what was driving that
and if it's just more sustainable organic growth? That would be helpful.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You've got to do it a little bit by business because I think in consumer mostly sticky but there's
probably a little bit of TAG. You guys had an estimate for that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Like $5 billion plus or minus but mostly those deposits we would consider core and sticky.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Right. And then TS&S is a lot of seasonal, year-end deposits so it bounces all over the place.
Asset Management I'd put in the sticky category. Commercial Bank has been kind of flat but it's sticky.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. That's helpful.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's flat because their loans are starting to grow and it's huge. In our Commercial (sic) [Bank] we
have $190 billion of deposits. I think that number was $100 billion 3.5 years ago.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So they have a lot of money there. We actually expect that might have come down one day as
companies start to grow and expand more aggressively, which would be a good thing.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hi. Good morning. This first question is a little bit short-term, so forgive me. But the CFTC,
as somebody mentioned earlier, did push back the timing of some of the OTC reforms which affect the central clearing.
And I guess my question is, from your point of view, all other things being equal, should we expect stronger fixed
income revenues as a result of that in the first half than we otherwise might have?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: That's a would've, should've, could've. I don't know, Guy, the answer to that question. I think if
they'd been put in place – it depends how they would have ultimately been put in place. So they were delayed so they
could get more work on how it gets done. I think if they'd been put in place for JPMorgan where the rules constrained
us overseas, but didn't constrain other companies overseas, we would be down from what we might now have. If the
rules were put in place such we can complete freely in Frankfurt, London, Singapore and Shanghai; my guess is our
U.S. revenues would've been down a little bit. Our international revenues would've been up a little bit.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's actually real helpful. Thanks. My other couple of questions have to do with
your outlook slide. First of all, in Corporate/Private Equity, I just want to make sure that there's no distinction that I
should read in. When you talk about Treasury and CIO, you talk about the net loss of $300 million plus or minus,
specifically in the first quarter. When you talk about the Other Corporate $100 million you don't mention a timeframe.
So does that mean that you expect more potential variability over say the course of this year in the Treasury and CIO
number than the Other number, which is more of a run rate?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No. Let me just – so Private Equity is $8 billion invested. We expect to earn a return on that and
we obviously have been getting a great return on it. So that's lumpy, but it should be more than $50 million on average.
Treasury, think of treasury as NII. It's fairly predictable – the NII is fairly predictable by quarter. That number will go
down a little bit. That's just how we allocate capital and funds between all the business units and then how we invest
the assets. So we can change that tomorrow by having longer duration of our investment portfolio. The only – the
lumpier part of Treasury and CIO is when we have mark-to-market gains or securities gains. That bounces around a
little bit. And again, some of that's discretionary. So we don't look at that as – we should almost call a net loss it's just –
and that number I think that the 300 will come down over time, not go up for a whole bunch of different reasons which
I won't go through right now.
And then the Other Corporate, well that has net allocations, BOLI, COLI, taxes, all of these lumpy items and we're just
trying to tell you it should be plus $100 million – it should be on average 100, but it's on average $100 million plus or
minus a couple $100 million because of lumpiness of those items. Like corporate taxes are lumpy for a whole bunch of
different reasons. And so our numbers would be $100 million on average and we always explain the difference if
there's ever a big difference there.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So if I add the two together, and obviously we know there's lumpiness, but just adding those
two numbers together at face value, we're talking about a quarterly loss of a couple of hundred million. You used to
guide to quarterly earnings of, I think it was $100 million to $200 million on that kind of combined line. So if I was
trying to assess what the swing had been relative to a few years ago, how much of it would you say is just the
compression of net interest margins and how much of it is moving away from some of the, pardon the word, but exotic
investment strategies that CIO used to...?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's got not a damn thing to do with exotic investment strategies. Zero, nada, nothing, okay? The
bulk of those assets always invested conservatively, AA plus, we had to do it around the world, accept deposits around
the world, et cetera. Nothing to do with that. It's all got to do with some of the NIM compression that shows up there
because obviously invested portfolio yield has gone from – it's down a little over 2%. It was 4% three years ago and
how we allocate capital and things like that. The changes you've seen, some of them are the differences due to
regulatory changes of B-3, RWA, stuff like that. So we'll try to make this a little bit clearer going forward. But on
average, that number will come down, not go up over time.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's fair. And then the final question I have is just on the firm-wide right below that.
You talked about capital allocations a moment ago. It sounds like your LOB return on equity targets are, like you say
here, are going to come down for some units and therefore overall, but the corporate guidance is the same. So does that
mean that basically all this change just is because you're allocating more capital out to the business units and you'll

have less at the corporate parent? That's the only real change?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yes. When we allocate the new Basel III operational capital and all that, the capital allocations
will go up mostly to the CIB by, I'm going to say, 20% or so and to the Commercial Bank by 20% or so or maybe a
little bit more than that. And then – I'll just change the return targets of those units. They'll also be very healthy. They'll
just come down. The company will be exactly the same.
So we just – we want – and I think when we allocate all this stuff intelligently, we'll actually probably end up driving
better returns over time as people learn how to manage a little bit differently. So we'll be allocating – again at Investor
Day well show more. We'll be allocating out, think of it as everything at one point, LCR, GSIFI, Basel III, Basel II,
whatever comes down the pike we allocate out so our managers can manage through it.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. That's great. Thank you very much.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I mean all – and the only thing we haven't decided permanently is how you look at each business.
Because my thing has been – this is open for debate, is that the business should be capitalized the way its competitors
are going to be capitalized so they feel free to – they're free to compete in that category. I think the people lump their
capital ratios around their competitors. That can be very hard for someone, for example, to be, for example, run with
7.5% capital and all their competitors are at 10% or vice versa.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So you're going to try to move both capital and cost allocations more to each unit being on a
standalone basis. Is that right?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No. No. Cost is cost. We don't – it's nothing to do with that. I'm talking about capital, saying we
may capitalize the Commercial Bank at 8.5% and the Investment Bank at 10%. It may not be 9.5% for everybody
because they have to operate, they have to compete in different environments, but we just haven't figured out exactly
how to do that yet.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. Thanks.
