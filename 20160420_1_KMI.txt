MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the
presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you
have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.
Now, I'll turn the meeting over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Sean, and welcome to the KMI First Quarter Investor Call.

I'll start the call, and before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean; and our CFO, Kim Dang, I'd like to give you a quick
overview of our strategy at KMI.
The first point I would make is that this quarter's results again demonstrate that we remain a strong generator of cash,
even in these chaotic times for the energy sector.
Second, as we've said previously and at our meeting in January, we do not anticipate any requirement to access the
equity markets for the foreseeable future. We also do not see any requirement to access the debt markets for the
foreseeable future, except for rollovers in years subsequent to 2016.
We've again reduced our expansion CapEx. Steve will take you through that for 2016, and we expect that trend to
continue in subsequent years through both high grading our projects and entering into selective joint ventures. We
expect to fund the necessary CapEx out of our cash flow and continue to improve our debt to EBITDA ratio, thereby,
preserving and strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet.
As our cash flow achieves those objectives, funding our CapEx and strengthening our balance sheet, we will obviously
have excess cash which we will then use to either raise our dividend, purchase our shares or for new projects and/or
acquisitions, but only if they're solidly accretive to our distributable cash flow per share.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to hit on three topics before giving you some segment highlights for the quarter. First an
update to our capital projects and our expected growth spend for 2016, an update on our outlook for the balance of
2016 and some thoughts on our counterparty credit risk.
With respect to the capital update, we announced today a reduction in our project backlog of $4.1 billion. So from
$18.2 billion down to $14.1 billion. The two biggest adjustments are the removal of the Palmetto Pipeline Project,
which is a reduction of $550 million and the market portion of the NED project, which is a reduction of $3.1 billion.
With respect to NED, we worked very hard. This is our northeast direct project serving or that would have served New
England markets. We worked very hard to get customer commitments on the project. And while many of our LDC
customers did sign up, we did not receive enough contractual commitments from electric customers to make the project
viable. So we will fulfill our obligation to consult with our customers over the next 30 days or so, but this project is not
economic, so we're removing it from the backlog. In both cases, NED and Palmetto, based on all the facts, we believe
this is the right outcome for our investors.
To be specific, the return on the NED project, at the level of commitments that we have, would be less than 6%
unlevered after tax. That's clearly not viable, and we are far better off having that cash available for other uses. Whether
that's continued and even accelerated delevering, other investment opportunities or returning value to shareholders. We
value our New England customers and continue to believe, along with many others, that additional capacity is needed
in the region, but we'll have to look for other ways to serve some part of those needs. We didn't get there on this one,
and the action we're taking is undeniably the right call for our investors. We previously wrote off, I'll remind you, our
NED supply project, and we never had that one in the backlog.
On the Palmetto Pipeline, essentially the Georgia legislature prevented us from getting eminent domain and also
prevented us from getting other state permits. We were making good progress with land acquisition, even without
eminent domain, but we needed other permits which Georgia has now put a moratorium on. We needed environmental
permits, for example, which they've now put a moratorium on until mid-2017. So as a result, we are not moving
forward with Palmetto. We had some other small adjustments to the backlog, including putting about $160 million
worth of projects and service during the quarter. We had some cost changes which netted to a reduction of $254 million
in the overall backlog, and we had some other scope, additions and removals which essentially offset each other.

So looking at the bigger picture on our capital project spend, we continue to high grade our capital investments to
ensure that we're securing our investment-grade credit metrics and maximizing the returns we get for the capital that we
do deploy. We're aiming to reduce spend, improve returns and selectively joint venture projects where that makes
sense. We reduced our expected 2016 spend by an additional $400 million, to $2.9 billion. So that compares to the $3.3
billion that we projected in January for 2016, which in turn, was $900 million down from the $4.2 billion that we
projected in our preliminary 2016 guidance which we sent out last December. So we've continued to work through our
backlog and high grade where we're spending our capital.
With respect to joint ventures, as we discussed at the January conference, we'd be pursuing these where they made
sense, that is, where we could share the capital spending obligation on a particular project with a third party, get paid a
reasonable value for having originated the opportunity, et cetera. Those processes are competitive and confidential, so
only going to be able to give you limited details. But the summary is that the process is going well, and we currently
expect to achieve the results that we built into our plan. We're also taking care to not be dependent on any one
transaction. These processes can be unpredictable, and we will be in a position to back away from a given transaction if
acceptable value does not materialize.
Overall, as we complete projects and further high grade the backlog, as Rich mentioned, we will free up cash that we
can use to reduce debt, return cash to investors in the form of buybacks or dividends or invest in attractive projects or
acquisitions, or some combination of those.
Now for the 2016 outlook update, we have looked at the potential impacts for the remainder of 2016, due to continued
weakness in the sector. We now estimate on a full-year basis for 2016 a negative impact of about 3% to the EBITDA
that we showed in January. But because of our ongoing efforts to high grade our capital spend and to pursue the joint
ventures where they make sense, we expect to meet our investment grade credit metrics, notwithstanding the 3%
reduction. That 3% EBITDA reduction translates into a 4% reduction in DCF. As the year goes on, we will try to
mitigate that negative, but we are not assuming in this outlook any dramatic turnaround for our producer customers by
the end of the year as some analysts have predicted.
Now we're not happy about any negative to plan, but I think when you put this in the context of the dramatic production
declines, particularly in the Eagle Ford which is down 28% on oil from its peak and 50% on gas, and credit
weaknesses, our business is really diversified and insulated from the full brunt of the weakness in the producing sector.
So here the two main contributors. A little under half of the deterioration is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes
and those flow-through both our midstream group in the gas business unit and also in our Products Group. And again,
this is all comparing to our original outlook, so this is not a year-over-year look. This is versus our January outlook that
we presented at the conference. So a little under half, attributable to the Eagle Ford. Another 20% is attributable to the
coal customer bankruptcies. So there are a lot of other pieces and Kim will take you through some additional details,
but those are the two big chunks contributing to the degradation in the forecast.
While the current year outlook for North American energy production is experiencing weakness, we're still bullish on
the longer term. We believe that we'll continue to see more of our North American energy needs met by North
American energy production, that we'll grow our exports. We've already been growing refined products, natural gas to
Mexico. I think we'll continue to see growth in natural gas and natural gas liquids exports. And those long-term trends
are good for North American energy, midstream companies like Kinder Morgan.
Okay. The third general topic is counterparty credit. We've been monitoring counterparty credit very closely, but
beyond monitoring, we've been taking action. We've been calling on collateral, putting other credit support
arrangements in place. A few points about our particular circumstances. Given our diverse business mix, we've got a
very broad and diverse customer base. We've got producer customers, of course, but we also have integrated energy
companies, gas and electric utilities and industrial users of our services. We're not exposed to any single sector
commodity or service. That diversifies our exposure which reduces our risk.
Our top 25 customers constitute 44% of our revenue, and of that revenue, 85% is investment grade. Of our total
revenue, about 75% is investment grade or has substantial credit support, and 86% is rated B or better. In our business,

real exposure is more complicated than simply looking at our customer's ratings. In many cases, the rights our
customers hold are valuable to third parties or essential to the revenue-generating activities of those customers, and
therefore, will be needed on an ongoing basis by the customer or, in the worst case, a debtor in possession in
bankruptcy or a subsequent purchaser.
We analyze all of those factors and mitigation to get to our credit concern list. Our identified credit concern list
amounts to about 5% of revenue and about half of that is mitigated by credit support or underlying resale value of the
capacity that the customers hold. And those numbers, that 5% and that half of 5% include Peabody, the Peabody
bankruptcy, which we're now reflecting. So the going forward number is less than that. We're reflecting Peabody, the
Peabody bankruptcy in our forecast update.
So in the segments, a few highlights, looking at the first quarter of 2016 to Q1 of 2015. The overall summary is this. On
an earnings before DD&A and certain items basis three of our five business units grew year-over-year. Gas was up 4%,
Products Pipelines was up 17%, Terminals was up 2%. Kinder Morgan Canada would have been up year-over-year, but
for the effect of a weakening Canadian dollar, and CO2 was down 21% as a result of lower commodity prices and some
lower production.
On Natural Gas Pipelines, we had very strong performance on TGP and the contributions from our Hiland Midstream
acquisition. So we split the Hiland acquisition between our Midstream business unit in Gas and our Products Pipelines
for the Double H pipeline. So contributions from really, really strong performance on TGP and the contribution from
our Hiland Midstream acquisition that we made in the first quarter of last year. Those two things more than offset
weakness in our other midstream assets and in our western pipelines. The Midstream weakness is largely gathering and
processing in the Eagle Ford and on a year-over-year basis, gathering in the Haynesville. In the West, year-over-year
growth on our EPNG system was more than offset by weakness in Cheyenne Plains, WIC, CIG and TransColorado as
the fundamentals for basis pipes out of the Rockies continues to degrade.
Natural gas needs for transportation and storage services we believe should grow over the medium and long-term as
power generation exports including LNG and exports to Mexico and petchem and industrial demand continue to grow.
Over the last two years, the Gas Group has entered into new and firm, new and pending firm transport capacity
commitments totaling 8.2 Bcf and I think, importantly, about 1.8 Bcf of that was existing previously unsold capacity.
And we currently estimate that we move about 38% of the natural gas consumed in the United States on our pipelines.
Moving to the Product segment. The 17% year-over-year growth in segment earnings was driven by growth in KMCC.
That's our crude and condensate pipeline out of the Eagle Ford and the full quarter operation of the first splitter in the
Houston Ship Channel. We have both splitters up and running in the Houston Ship Channel. We also saw a good refine
products transportation growth, 2.3% increase year-over-year. And while Eagle Ford volumes have declined overall,
and we are projecting some decline on our assets as we look forward, we have seen volumes grow on our KMCC
pipeline as projects have come on. And we think that's due to the pipe's in a great position. It's serving a great part of
that market. It has good upstream and downstream connectivity and good contracts. Now we think we've just started to
see some flattening in that pipeline, but if you think about what's happened in the Eagle Ford overall, what we've done
on this pipe is essentially dramatically grow our market share out of the basin on that pipe.
CO2, we saw earnings before DD&A declined 20% year-over-year to $223 million for the quarter. Production net to
our interest was down 7%. And I will point out SACROC was down, but Jesse can confirm this, but I think we had our
highest quarter probably in the fourth quarter of 2014 at SACROC, and then our next highest was in the first quarter of
2015. So a very strong quarter in 2015 that we're comparing to our 2016 performance.
The CO2 Group has, well, I'll also mention price. The weighted average realized price has declined about 18%
year-over-year. Of course, that's a big part of the explanation for the downturn on a year-over-year basis.
The CO2, on the bright side, the CO2 Group has been very diligent in reducing costs and husbanding our capital to the
very highest available return opportunities. And I will say, perhaps somewhat counter intuitively, third party demand
for CO2 under our arrangements with them has stayed strong. We're roughly flat year-over-year on CO2,
notwithstanding the deterioration in commodity prices.

Moving to Terminals, Terminals was up 2% year-over-year. Growth in this business came from expansions and
acquisitions which slightly more than offset the weakness in our Bulk business, and that being driven primarily by
bankruptcies of our coal customers. Most of our Liquids Terminal business is in refined products, and we've continued
to see high utilization and generally good pricing on roll-overs and renewals there. And we continue to have a very
strong outlook for the great Liquids Terminals positions that we've built in the Houston Ship Channel and Edmonton.
Kinder Morgan Canada, the Trans Mountain Expansion project. So, again, this is under long-term contracts with
customers. The three key areas of focus for us remain getting the NEB-recommended order and the cabinet-level Order
in Council from the federal process, consultation and accommodation with First Nations, and thirdly, satisfaction of the
BC government's five conditions. We're making progress on all three.
With respect to the NEB, we got our draft conditions last August. We believe that they're manageable, but we did seek
some important changes, particularly around the time required to approve certain portions of the build. We now have
the outline of the further process to be conducted by the federal government during the Order in Council process, which
is expected to result in a final order. They've scheduled a final order for December 20 of this year. We're making good
progress and meeting the consultation and accommodation obligations we have with the First Nations and we've added
mutual benefit agreements that bring us to a number – a majority of the bands that are most directly affected by the
project actually supporting the project.
On the five conditions, we're still working on those. We are engaged actively with the BC government on those. The
BC government is also going to be conducting an environmental review under their provincial process. We expect that
both of those things will be concluded within the same timeframe of the federal process. Maybe not the same day but
within the same general timeframe. And we have this project in the backlog and we are aiming for a 2019 completion,
end of 2019 completion.
And that's it for the segment updates. With that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share. That's consistent with our budget and the
guidance we gave you in December of last year. But most importantly, we generated $954 million of DCF in excess of
our dividends which, as Steve and Rich pointed out, insulates us from the challenging capital markets and significantly
enhances our credit profile.
Now let me explain what I mean when we say significantly enhances our credit profile. If you compare our coverage
ratio, and that's DCF divided by the dividend, in the first quarter of last year, which was 1.2 times, versus the 4.4 times
in the first quarter of this year, we have significantly more retained cash flow, approximately $750 million, and
therefore, we have no capital markets risk to getting equity raised. In addition, our previous funding policy was to fund
our expansion CapEx, 50% equity and 50% debt. Now we're using 100% retained cash flow and, therefore, our balance
metrics will improve more quickly than under our prior funding models.
Before we get to DCF, let me point out a couple of things on our GAAP income statement. You will see that revenues,
net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share are down. As I say in many quarters, we do not
believe that these measures or changes in these measures are necessarily a good predictor of our performance. We have
some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not. In
addition, these numbers can be impacted by non-cash, non-recurring accounting issues or what we call certain items.
For example, if you look at revenues, revenues are down $402 million, or 11%. However, if you strip out the certain
items with the primary certain item impacting revenues being the CO2 and the mark-to-market on our other hedges,
revenues would be down $316 million. When you compare the $316 million to the $359 million reduction in cost of
goods sold, gross margin is actually up. Again, that's largely because we have some businesses where both revenues
and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices.

With respect to net income, if you strip out the certain items – and I'll go through those with you in a minute – net
income before certain items was $446 million compared to $445 million for the same period in 2015, or essentially flat.
EPS before certain items – and here, when you do EPS, earnings is defined as net income to common shareholders, so
after the payment of the preferred – EPS before certain items was $0.18 versus the $0.12 that you see on the page for
the first quarter of 2016, compared to $0.20 in the first quarter of 2015. So while stripping out certain items from
earnings does help, we still believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate, which we
measure as distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow per share.
So let's turn to the second page of the financials, which I believe will give you a clearer picture of our performance. We
generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.233 billion versus the $1.242 billion for the comparable period in 2015.
Therefore, total DCF was down approximately $9 million. So essentially flat between the two periods. The segments
were up by $28 million, as Steve mentioned, or 1% with the increases in Natural Gas and Products, which combined
for an increase of $85 million, slightly offsetting the $58 million reduction in CO2, which was driven largely by lower
crude price.
The $28 million increase in the segments was offset by a $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividends. If you
remember, we issued a preferred stock in the fourth quarter of last year. Now there are other moving parts, but if you
take the $28 million from the segments offset by the $39 million, that gets you a decrease of $11 million versus a
decrease in DCF that I mentioned of $9 million. So that gets you almost all of the change.
DCF per share in the quarter was $0.55 versus $0.58 for the first quarter of last year. DCF per share was down slightly
due to the additional shares we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet.
Therefore, despite an almost 30% decline in commodity prices versus the first quarter of last year, our performance was
relatively flat and we believe that this demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified
platform of primarily fee-based assets.
There are a couple of certain items in the quarter that I want to highlight for you. Certain items in the quarter totaled a
$235 million loss on a pre-tax basis, but a $132 million loss on an after-tax basis. $170 million of the pre-tax loss was
driven by the write-off of costs associated with the NED market and the Palmetto project, which as Steve mentioned,
have also been removed from the backlog. $85 million was associated with losses on asset disposals and impairments
in four of our business segments with the most significant items being in CO2 and Terminals. In CO2, it was primarily
associated with the write-off of a CO2 recapture plant due to lack of expected volumes, and in Terminals, it was due to
lost business at three of our Bulk Terminals. We also, there were certain tax benefit of $103 million, and that's
primarily just a tax impact of the certain items at approximately 35%.
As Steve mentioned in his comments, we currently expect EBITDA for the year to be approximately 3% below our
budget and DCF to be approximately 4% below. Now, for the first quarter, we did better than that with EBITDA about
2% below our budget and DCF about 1% below our budget. But we believe our outlook is consistent with the current
environment and producer decisions and we are not assuming any improvements.
Let me give you a little more granularity on expected segment performance for the full year versus our budget. We
expect Natural Gas Pipelines to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of lower volumes
mainly in the Eagle Ford. The other factor impacting our Natural Gas [indiscernible] for the full year is the delay on our
EEC/SNG pipeline expansion project as a result of the FERC certificate being about three months later than we
anticipated.
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. We expect prices to be essentially in line with our $38 per barrel in our
budget and cost savings to offset any weakness in oil production or CO2 volumes. We expect Terminals to end the year
approximately 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the Peabody bankruptcy. We currently expect
Products to be about 6% below its budget, primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H
and Double Eagle. Right now we are projecting KMCC to be slightly below its budget for the full year due to higher
book taxes but remember that book taxes, while they impact the segment, have no impact on EBITDA or DCF.

With respect to interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx, on a combined basis, those items are expected to come
in slightly positive to budget, or said another way, generate a favorable variance with the positives on interest and
sustaining CapEx more than offsetting the negatives on G&A and cash taxes. The negative variance on G&A is driven
by lower capitalized overhead as a result of the lower expansion capital that Steve mentioned, and interest expense is
expected to be lower than budget due to lower LIBOR rates.
And with that, I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with debt of $41.555 billion and EBITDA for the
trailing 12-months is about $7.4 billion, which results in a debt to EBITDA of about 5.6 times, consistent with where
we ended the year last year. And as Steve mentioned, we still expect to end 2016 at 5.5 times consistent with our
budget. Debt was up in the quarter, an increase in debt of about $330 million since the end of last year.
So let me reconcile that for you. We generated DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned a minute ago, of $1.233 billion. We
spent about $700 million in CapEx, we spent about $245 million roughly on acquisitions, with almost all of that being
associated with the BP acquisition, and we contributed about $44 million to equity investments. So about $990 million
roughly attributable to our expansion CapEx program. We paid dividends of $279 million and then there were working
capital and other items that were a use of roughly $300 million.
When you look at the use of working capital, over $150 million of that was associated with the crude interest. And
when I give you the DCF figure of $1.233 billion, that has three months of accrued interest in it, but we make interest
payments twice a year. We make them primarily in the first quarter and the third quarter, and so we make cash interest
payments in the first quarter attributable to six months. So, you have a working capital use associated with the
incremental six months of cash going out the door, which is different from the three months of accrual that's in DCF.
The other working capital use in the quarter was primarily associated with property tax and there's probably about $100
million associated with that. Again, we have about three months of property tax accrual in the quarter. By the time you
get to the end of the year, you have 12 months of accrual, but a lot of our property tax payments are made for the full
year in January. And therefore, relative to DCF, you have a working capital use in the quarter. In future quarters, you'll
have a working capital source. And that gets you to about the $330 million increase in debt.
And so with that, I'll turn it back to Rich.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. And at this time, Sean, we'll take questions that people may have.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Jeremy.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Hi. Good afternoon. I was just wondering if you – as far as the guidance reduction, what were
the different drivers there? If you could walk through that just one more time for us, that would be helpful.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, I'll start with the two big pieces and then Kim has some additional detail. But as I said
about, just a little under half of it, a little under 50% of the reduction is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes than
what we had in the plan. So I talked about volumes being up year-over-year but versus what we had in the plan, we had
lower Eagle Ford volumes. And that impact, that's trying to sum up everything. So that is on our Eagle Ford gathering
system itself, on our DK header line and processing facility. It's also volumes that were entering into our Texas
intra-state system that we expected to be able to move on that system and collect transport fees. So it's kind of from
end-to-end, almost, on the Eagle Ford volumes through our Texas assets.

The other place where we have exposure to the Eagle Ford volumes is in our Products Pipelines where we have the
KMCC pipeline and the splitter. We'd expected the splitter in our plan to run a little bit above its contract minimums.
We have good contracts with good protection there. It's running – we're expecting it kind of just to run at the
minimums, which are pretty good. I mean, it's a pretty high percentage of the capacity of the facility but we had
budgeted a little bit more there. And KMCC, we expect we're now going to start to see some volumetric decline on
that. Again, that's all versus plan. So that's a little – if you just say – and, look. There are lots of different ways to rack
up these numbers, but those factors, the Eagle Ford volumes as they impact two of our business units, amount to about
half, a little less than half of the adjustment, the another 20% is attributable to the coal company bankruptcy. So those
are the two very big pieces.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: That's great. Thanks for that. And then as far as the decision to take NED off now versus
later, can you just walk through the timing to it? And also, just if you'll look into high grade, the growth CapEx
backlog, are there any other items that are coming under closer scrutiny that you could point us towards? Or you feel
like where the backlog is right now is a good place for where you want it to be?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, so on the first point, and I want to separate that a little bit from the high grading
discussion because, look, we gave it our all on NED. We pursued customers hard; we pursued approvals hard. In the
end, the customer commitments just weren't there. Now that makes the project uneconomic, not surprisingly, and that's
why I wanted to specify the return for you. It's apparent. It's objectively apparent that the project is not economically a
viable project at that customer sign-up level. And so we said at the conference we were going to make a big push in the
first quarter to try to get customer commitments in and sell down some of the equity to customers. Not a lot of takers at
that return, as you might expect. And so we put on a hard push to try to get done, and it's just not forthcoming. We had
one significant prospective customer who determined to put their volumes someplace else. And that was a significant
negative for the project.
So that's how we got to that decision in the time that we're talking about now. But I want to go back and underscore,
again, from an investor standpoint, in light of that return, we are a lot better off with that $3.1 billion back in our
pockets and being put to some other use. The project wasn't going to produce the return that would be required to make
it viable because again, the contracts weren't there. We're better off having that money back. I think if you look through
the rest of the backlog, my guess is we'll find some bits and pieces here and there that we'll either save some money on
or we may change the timing of a little bit. Still think those are high probability projects though and ones that we want
to build out and do, and they contribute to our DCF per share growth that we're aiming to achieve by building it out.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And just to underscore, the average, the year one EBITDA multiple on the projects in
the backlog, excluding CO2, so as we said on CO2, we look at the projects at the time we enter into. I mean it's forward
curve at that time. And we target at least a 15% unlevered after tax return. But on the non-CO2 projects, the average
year one multiple – EBITDA multiple is 6.7 times.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. Thank you. And then one last one if I could. Just kind of curious how you guys think
about a high level now. As far as you know, with the backlog standing at $14 billion, the size of the entity as it is right
now, what type of EBITDA growth do you guys see yourselves being able to achieve? Is there anything different than
what you guys have communicated historically as far as kind of base growth that this business can throw off?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: One very simple way to look at it is to take the 6.7 multiple off of $14.1 billion and divide
that by the number of shares outstanding. And you can see what that works out to be. And it's $0.70, $0.75 per share.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: You take off the CO2 from the $14.1 billion.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Right.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And then you'll get roughly, it's going to be in the range of $1.8 billion. And all but
about $175 million is incremental to 2016.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. That's it for me. Thank you.

Thank you. Next question on queue is coming from Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Your line is open. You may begin.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: First question, just to follow-up on the discussion on CapEx, when I look at it for 2016
you've now revised it lower again, which I guess is good in this environment. You also mentioned that in terms of
pulling NED out, about how you're focusing on returns. And I think you made a general comment about just trying to
high grade returns and so forth. The change this year, how much is related just to the removal of NED and Palmetto?
Or have there been any improvements in costs? Are you able to beat up your contractors a little bit to improve returns?
And I was wondering if you can also talk about on a delta basis what the impact would be of the removal of NED and
Palmetto on the 2017 budget. I realize that – obviously that has not been presented, but just what the delta? What you
would have expected to have spent on those two projects in 2017?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I don't have the 2017 CapEx numbers. I think Palmetto, and speaking with respect to the
backlog, so Palmetto was about $515 million, and of course NED was about $3.3 million, so that explains most of the
backlog reduction. On the CapEx front, it's a mix of things. We had some spend for NED in there, but we don't really
have construction spend for NED in 2016. So that would not have been a huge component of the $3.1 billion. And
Palmetto was primarily a land acquisition and maybe the start of construction. So it was not just those, it was also, we
got cost reductions, we had other projects that we removed. As we said at the beginning of the year, we made some JV
assumptions as well.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We have one project the timings moved out on, so it's deferred a little bit.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, one deferral. So it's a whole mix of...
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Sure.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: So the cost reductions, is that something that we can see more of on a go-forward basis?
Because it was interesting you used the language of improving returns or if that's just totally about high grading?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It's a number of things. So we have seen – so a lot of our focus now is on build-outs of our
existing network. And we have seen some improvement in returns, partly because we've made some scope refinements.
Other cost reductions that, call it, more market-oriented that it's costing less to do things now than it did in the more
heated environment. And we've also added customers to some of our expansions. One example I'm thinking of is in our
Texas intra-states. So we're marching – so in other words, even within an individual projects, we're trying to march
returns up by doing those three things: optimizing scope, reducing cost and adding revenue.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. And then I was wondering if you can just sort of turn to Trans Mountain a little bit.
Obviously you took NED out because of returns issue. At this stage right now, is Trans Mountain at risk for the same
thing, regardless of what happens on the approval process? Are the returns that you expect at your latest update, does it
look – is it close to your return hurdle? Or is it well above your return hurdle? And I was wondering if you could
comment about some of the comments that the Canadian government made last week with respect specifically to
pipelines. Do you view that as a positive? Or do you just sort of continue your focus as is?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, huge, huge difference between NED and Trans Mountain. Trans Mountain is under
contract. That's an enormous difference. We were fighting to get NED under contract and didn't get there. Trans
Mountain has the contracts in place, 20-year contracts for 93% of the volume and the other 7% is on a 15-year contract.
So, long-term contracts. And, look, the overall picture in Canada is – notwithstanding very, very difficult net backs up
there, right? They're taking a very long view. The producers are taking a long view and they're finishing out projects

that they're well into. And the oil sands become a very stable source of production. It's not like the Shales where it
ramps – you get a high ramp up in the beginning and then it falls off rapidly. So there's an actual projection of an
increase in production in Canada at the same time that the transport options out of Canada are becoming more limited.
So our customers still want to do this project and we do too and the returns are good.
Switching to the public opinion or the governmental outlook, I would say just very broadly that the tone of the
comments in the public arena up there are improving. I think that there is a recognition that getting Canadian natural
resources to points where they can be exported and no longer dependent upon solely the U.S. market is a good thing
across Canada. And that's starting to show up as people are being constructive about, okay, we need to approve
projects. We want to approve them with – we want to have the right conditions and the right process around that
approval, but there's been a switch, I think, toward momentum, toward getting the project approved.
Now I'll say that with an important caveat. We don't know what their conditions ultimately are going to be in the end
and we'll have to make an assessment of that when it's all in. We certainly have a good handle on what the NEB
proposed conditions are going to look like, but we don't know what, if any, other conditions may be imposed. So we're
going to have to watch for that very carefully. But we've got good returns, good underlying customer support and
contractual support and an improving tone, I think, in the public sector debate.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. And one last final question, if I may. Earnings up year-over-year and if you take
out some of your negative charges related to coal bankruptcies, up a little bit more, I was wondering if you can break
down how much the delta is due to acquisitions, for example, like Hiland versus some of your growth projects coming
online, is that a good way for us to assess the returns relative to the CapEx that was spent last year?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I don't have a breakdown of what is attributable in aggregate to expansions and acquisitions,
but I think you can assume it's probably more than that year-over-year change.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah, But I think you can also just include the capital from the acquisitions in your
denominator if you're trying to get a return. We think about our acquisitions as investing capital and it's important to get
– it's as important to get returns on that capital as on the expansion CapEx.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Absolutely. I was just more trying to figure out if the returns were higher from your
organic versus your acquisitions and so forth, but – okay.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Generally, that is the case.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Generally, yes. In the acquisition context, you look a little differently at something that's
already up and running, already producing cash flow, versus a start-from-scratch investment and an expansion where
you're going to be putting money out before you see the cash in and you've got construction risk and other things to
take into account. So you generally aim for a higher return.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Right. I just wanted to see if that was the case, but I can follow up offline with David.
Thank you very much, guys.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Thanks.

<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Afternoon, everyone. Let's see. I'll start smaller line item, but interesting nevertheless, I

year into next year, and maybe some incremental contracts off that pipe?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Generally, we contributed $311.5 million. That contribution is in the original $3.3
billion expansion CapEx budget and is in the $2.9 billion revised. So all taken into account in our guidance. Generally
versus 2015, NGPL's EBITDA is increasing as a result of some of the expansion projects that it is bringing online.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. And, Kim, any expectation of incremental cash support there? Or does it look good
on a go-forward basis?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: No expectation for further contribution in 2016. And in 2017 and beyond, we'll just have
to evaluate that as we get there.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Fair enough. And then I think, Steve, you mentioned some other alternatives to getting gas
to the northeast other than Northeast Direct. Is there anything that we could look to or think about in terms of alternate
strategies there or incremental projects that may be possible?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I'll give you a couple things, but then – and Tom, if you have anything to add. I think we
haven't even – we've just barely started those discussions. So it's just too early to give you anything that's very specific.
I do think that one general observation is that the NED project had scale and so the tariff was better likely than what
smaller project development tariffs would be. So it's not likely to – it's not going to be anything that's going to add up in
the end to an NED-sized project, it'll be bits and pieces here and there. Tom, is that...
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, that's a fair assessment. We'll just have to work with particularly our LDC customers
and see what we can do on an expansion of the existing PTP system and see if there's something there that works. But
clearly there's need both in the near-term and ultimately we believe in the long-term in the region, but we'll just try to
scale up with that demand as it develops.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. Good color. And then as a follow-up on that one, this is a big picture question, not
Kinder-specific, but just generally about Northeast infrastructure, any comments that you care to put out there in terms
of projects that are needed? But contrast it against producer balance sheets and the ability to kind of back stop those
projects, do you see any issues over the next two or three years in terms of getting gas out of the basin?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, I think it's obviously harder for producers to commit. And we're seeing that in our
business to commit to large expansions to move gas out of the basin. I think on the other side of the – of the other end
of the pipe, I mean, we think and a lot of other third parties have pointed out that the New England market needs
natural gas and needs additional natural gas. And so we think that need is already there. But there is a regulatory
process that has to get sorted out up there for how the power part of the business is going to procure the needs for their
generating assets. And that's been a work in progress. It hasn't – and who knows when they ultimately get that resolved.
So there's definitely less producer push activity for anything large. And we think on the demand side, infrastructure is
still needed, but they've got to come to terms with how it can get contracted for.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: That's all for me, thank you very much.

may begin.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian D. Gamble>: Good afternoon. Wanted to start on the NEB projects since you just finished up chatting
about that. When you mentioned essentially the commitment level not enough from the electric customers, was there
any single reason, Steve, that you can point to as kind of the biggest reason for non-commitment? And then, any color
you want to give on why that one specific customer that you mentioned went in a different direction would, obviously,
be helpful just to get a little flavor for what's going on up in that market?

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I'm not sure I want to get into that customer's particular thinking and thought process and
the choice they made. I think that the main thing from our standpoint is we needed that and we needed additional
sign-up. And the insight into why we didn't get it, we don't think it had anything to do with quality of the project. It was
a good quality project. We think it relates to the thing I closed the last answer with which is that the processes up there
just have not fully formed in a way that will allow the electric generation load that needs firm natural gas infrastructure
on a long-term basis to get approved and costs passed through. And so I think those are the two things that really kept
us from getting where we needed to go on the electric part of the business, not because there was inferiority in our
proposal.
<Q - Brian D. Gamble>: Great. And then on the impact to the 2016 outlook, you walked through the Eagle Ford
volumes and where they're hitting your system. I guess stepping back from that, why do you think those volumes are
lower? Do you think from your previous expectation, it's lower activity level in the basin?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes.
<Q - Brian D. Gamble>: Or do you think that's getting lower contribution from existing wells because essentially the
decline curves are higher? Or is it a combination?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It's really lower activity. I mean I think the rig count there is 40% below what we were looking
at and thinking about in October. And so it doesn't mean it can't come back at some point. There's an oil window.
There's an NGL window. And all this is associated production, the gas that's coming out is associated gas. But I think
that takes commodity price recovery for people to come back and start deploying rigs and completing wells and the rest
of it.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And it's a basin-wide phenomena. I think you gave the figures at the start which you might
give again, the decline both in oil...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, oil was down 28% from its peak, gas, 15%. And so they're big, big declines. I mean,
again, I think KMCC's resilience has been surprising. And it's really driven by the fact, and you see this in the Bakken,
too, that there are some places which are really core that there's still some activity going on. And that's kept KMCC at
relatively lofty volume levels, comparatively, but the overall basin is in decline and will be until there's price recovery
that draws the rigs back out.
<Q - Brian D. Gamble>: And what type of rig changes are you expecting from where we are today, is that baked into
the new guidance?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We just kind of assumed that things did not improve and built in a, kind of an observed decline
rate going forward. And so we didn't – so our numbers don't translate into rig counts. Our numbers are just like a
continued decline rate, an extrapolation from current decline rates.
<Q - Brian D. Gamble>: So assume that Eagle Ford production from essentially current levels continues to degrade
throughout the year?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah.
<Q - Brian D. Gamble>: And then you touched on some of the progress from the JV standpoint and gave a little color
there. I really just wanted to kind of touch on big picture, nothing specific, but the general attitude of third parties since
the beginning of the year, any color you can give us on any changes that you've seen? Any improvements? Any people
that are more pessimistic than they were? What direction are they trending?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, I think all we can say is that the response to our JVs has been positive, and as Steve
said, that we anticipate to getting completed what we talked about earlier in the year and what we have in our forecast.
<Q - Brian D. Gamble>: Great. I appreciate it, guys.

Thank you, sir. The next question on queue is coming from the line of Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Your line
is open. You may begin.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Darren. How're you doing?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Good afternoon, everyone. I'm doing fine. Thanks, Rich. Hope you're doing well. Two
quick questions for me. Kim, the first one on gas pipes, regarding that contract renewal deterioration that you all had
discussed a few quarters ago, if you back out the Eagle Ford and the SNG expansion project issues, how much of that
2% segment profit shift is coming from areas where recontracting is an issue like in the Rockies on either WIC or CIG?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Okay, so you're asking about the 2% versus our plan? Down for the year?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Right. Correct.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: There is less than 10% that's coming out of the Rockies pipes, and it's primarily
associated with CIG.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. And outside of any of the intrastate systems, just across the aggregate asset
landscape, is there any other material recontractings, FERC or otherwise, that we should be watching over the next 12
months?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think, I'll probably refer – in our conference presentation, I think we had a sensitivity over the
years. And this would be in, I think this was actually in the appendix, right? Yeah, Darren, we've got those, we have
those numbers in – here it is. Yeah, so 2017 total GPG and this is stated in terms of our share of recontracting exposure
0.7% 2017 and 1.3% 2018. And I think, you know, look that's probably attributed fair amount to the Rockies' assets.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. And then last question either for you, Steve, or Rich. With regard to this common
theme of being focused on return for equity holders here and obviously recognizing the ability to fund 100% of the
growth projects with retained cash for the next few years, that being at the top of the priority list, what is the
quantitative target on leverage that you're looking to achieve before you consider enhancing that equity value, and also,
your preference between share buybacks, dividend increases or maybe a balance between both?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, let me answer the first question first, and that is we remain consistent with what
we've said previously that, as we promised the rating agencies, that we would be in the range of 5.5 times going down
to 5 times debt to EBITDA and we would anticipate achieving the bottom end of that range on a going forward basis.
With regard to the second thing, that will be a decision that we'll make as that cash flow comes to fruition. And at that
time, we'll just look at all the factors and see what makes sense. I think it's an enviable position to be in. I feel that way
as the largest shareholder, and we'll look at it. If it makes the most sense to buy back shares at that time, we'll buy them
back. I can tell you, if the price were where it is today at $19, we would buy it back. But we'll see where the price is
and see what the market looks like and whether we'd benefit our shareholders in a better way by buying back their
shares or by raising the dividend. But we'll have the capacity to do either one if we want to do that once we get more
funding of our capital projects done and once we get our balance sheet in the shape we want to get it in.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Thanks, Rich.

<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Hey, guys. Thanks for the update on the backlog numbers. From my mind it makes sense on
those removals, but when I'm taking the lower backlog now, and thinking about looking in a little longer term towards
2017 and you know, especially with your comments you just made, Rich, in terms of getting to that five times number,
do I now have line of sight on getting to that? Maybe in 2017 timeframe or am I thinking a little too ahead of myself
there?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well we'll just see how everything comes together, and we want to get these joint ventures
closed. We want to look at all the high grading, we want to see exactly what comes out over the remainder of the year,
but certainly, we're getting closer to getting to that happy sunlit meadow where we can afford to make those choices.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Okay. And then when I'm in that happy sun meadow at the end of 2017 on my numbers that
means in 2018 I could have those conversations which you had mentioned in the beginning of the call, more
strategically around growth and buybacks, or deciding out on longer-term additional incremental projects and stuff like
that, right?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think that's right.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Okay. Perfect. And then my next question is, we've had a bunch of conversations with peers
or you had a bunch of peers out there as well talking about contract written negotiations you know, in lines of maybe
giving up on fees and returns for longer-term contracts or acreage dedication. Can you touch on what you guys are
seeing on your side?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Interestingly, we're kind of in a net positive right now on the contract renegotiation front.
We went through a process on our Hiland Midstream assets of, I think the easiest way to think about it is we, we had a
new deal to enable us to hook up more production up there, and that was advantageous to the producers as well as to us.
We fixed our fees, and took commodity exposure off and the producer wanted back, wanted to have the commodity, the
commodity upside, but the bottom line for us is we improved our position on a, on a 2016 basis, and improved our fee
recoveries on those, on those renegotiated contracts. So we're up, so far, this year. Now other, you know, other
customers do approach us in the Gas Group, occasionally on contract restructurings. So far, we haven't had to do
anything that we didn't want to do, meaning finding something that had mutual benefit, finding incremental volumes
that we could put on. At the same time, we made some concession that they wanted. So I think they've been generally
win-win situations, Tom, and so, I think, a pretty good story so far for us.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: And we've done some enhancement.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: And we've done credit enhancement. This is part of the trade too.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: And can you maybe talk in terms of credit enhancements? I know you mentioned earlier
about conversations with customers, asking them to post some more collateral, just how those are going? Have you had
any resistance on that side or just any color on that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We've got, we pulled a lot of collateral in and we've also done some other alternative things.
We have interactions with customers sometimes in a number of places, where we can put netting arrangements in place,
for example. Some of our producers, the cash flows through us before we net their recovery out. And so we have other
ways of kind of enhancing our credit position. And I think, to me, at least, the instructive number is what I said. We net
everything through, count all of our collateral up, look at our position and the underlying value of the capacity. If the
customer decided they didn't want it and went into bankruptcy, we see our credit concern list amounting to about 5% of
revenue, and about half of that is mitigated. And as I said, that already included the Peabody, and so that's now out of
our forecast. So the going forward numbers are small. All right?
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Yeah. Perfect. Thanks, guys. And thanks for the updates on the backlog too. Very helpful
there.

Thank you. Next question on queue is coming from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs? Your line's open. You may begin.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Ted. How're you doing?
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Rich, doing well, thanks. Just on the Elba, can you walk us through the milestones that we
should be looking for? And I think you said you pushed out some of the timing on the CapEx for that, this project this
year?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, the big upcoming milestone is May, when we expect to get our FERC certificate. And a
milestone that just recently passed, that we I think mentioned in the Investor Conference, is we, well it's announced
publicly so our contract with IHI, so they'll be our engineering procurement and construction contractor. That's a good
milestone for us to get behind us. That takes care of a lot of the construction risk. So we're looking for our FERC
authorization upcoming in the next month, and we have our EPC contract behind us.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: And what do you need still left on the FERC certificate? And you have the EIA, I think. But
what's left, exactly?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: So they circulate it for inter-agency comment. And we had hoped that – in fact, Kim mentioned
the impact of the delay on our Elba Express and SNG expansions that are hurting the South Pipeline Group in 2016.
What happened essentially is FERC put together on the same timeline, all of the certificate discussions. So we ended up
with that delay as those projects were drug into the overall Elba conversation I guess you'd say. What they're doing
right now is they're getting inter-agency commentary. We've spent a lot of time with those agencies. We think we've
addressed, we think their concerns are largely addressed and that's the part of the process that they're in now. So we do
expect to get a 7(c) certificate in May.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay. Great. And then if I can just ask, again just coming back to JVs, it sounds like you're
still pushing forward there even though you've dropped the backlog a lot. I guess at some point, we are going to run
into a lack of growth potentially given – delays in Trans Mount and whatnot. How are you thinking philosophically
about that? Do you back off of that if anything else falls out of the backlog? One into JV these projects? And then if
you can give us a sense of the returns that your JV partners would look for on an unlevered basis?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Not sure I can give you one on the latter, other than to emphasize what Rich said, which is
there's a lot of interest out there. So there's a fair amount of competition for people wanting to invest in these. We're
maintaining flexibility. We think that the JVs that we're pursuing do make sense and making sense in two ways. One is
getting someone else to share the capital burden on the development end of it. But also, we do believe that we'll see a
nice promote, a nice compensation if you will for having originated the project and that helps boost our return on the
capital that we do deploy. So in other words, Ted, we think that these – the ones that we're pursuing make sense and we
expect to continue to pursue them.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Got it. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.

Thank you, sir. The next question on queue will come from the line of Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers Investment
Research. Your line is open. You may begin.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Not to beat a dead horse with regards to the JV funding, but Steve, I think in your earlier
answer to Jeremy, you kind of noted that NED was obviously expected to have some JV partner CapEx support. With
NED gone, can you quantify how much in terms of as yet uncommitted but budgeted JV dollars are left in the budget?

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, we haven't really included – we did attempt to get JV partners on NED, but we never
really included that in our outlook. As I said at the conference, we had kind of two place holder numbers, two place
holder JV opportunities and it won't match perfectly what we had in the original outlook in terms of which ones we
pursue, But we expect to meet our targets for what the JVs will do for us this year in terms of reduced capital spend.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. And in terms of juicing the returns on the CapEx you do spend because of your value
you get from originating the projects with JV partners, do you see this simply taking projects already earning 15% plus
and juicing it all the more? Or do you see it taking projects that initially may not have been up to those standards but
can be pushed to those standards with the JVs?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, I think we first start by looking at what we need to do for our balance sheet metrics. But
we do keep an eye on what the longer-term impact of the JV decision is. And we are picking projects that I think are
attractive returns and that other people will find to be attractive returns, but we think that we can make better use of the
capital that comes in from their participation in the JV, meaning them buying into the project and funding the CapEx.
We can redeploy that in any of the ways that Rich mentioned better. So I think it's kind of both thing that you were
saying.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. Great. I appreciate the time.
Operator
Thank you, sir. The next question on queue is coming from John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, John. How are you?
<Q - John Edwards>: Good, Rich. Thanks for asking. Just a couple quick ones for me. I'm curious how much the –
maybe I missed it, what the write-up amount was for NED and Palmetto?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: It was about $100 million on NED and it was $65 million, $64 million on Palmetto.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Pre-tax.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. All right. And so you're looking at that in terms of the – how does that flow through on
your budget? Is it you're looking at it as kind of a non-cash item? Or is it hitting the EBITDA budget? Is that part of the
3%? Or how should I think about that?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We've set that aside as a certain item. So you can see that on the certain items. On the
project write-offs, there's $170 million, and I just gave you $165 million of it.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. Great. And then I'm just curious. You've brought the CapEx number down to $2.9
billion. Is the bias here to reduce the CapEx budget more? Or do you think you're going to go forward here around this
level?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think we believe this is a reasonable estimate here, but we will keep looking at it. And ideally
what we'd like to do, John, is keep finding ways to save costs, improve scope, add customers to project to boost returns.
So we'll continue to look at it to improve it. We are authorizing small additional projects. They're very small. They
have very good returns. They're kind of build-offs on our existing network, but this number reflects all of that along
with the reductions that we've been talking about on the call. So I think this is a reasonable estimate. There's the
possibility of taking a little bit more out of it, but this is a reasonable estimate to use.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. As far as taking a little bit more out of it, do you think that's going to come more from
project deferrals or more cost reductions? How are you thinking there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think it'll be more within the project. In other words, we look at the project and it gets delayed
or deferred or we find a cost savings in it.

<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. And then with crude oil prices improving here obviously off mid-quarter, we're up about
50% or so, what's your read on customer mood now? Is it cautiously optimistic? People still resisting project proposals?
What's the read through you guys are getting?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think that they're being cautious about their next move. I think they want to see, generally,
they're wanting to see some additional recovery and see some stability in that recovery. I also think that as a group
they've made themselves very, very flexible. They are updating their outlook and updating their decision-making. It's
no longer an annual process. It seems like it's a bi-weekly process or something now as they're looking at things, which
suggests that when they do decide to turn things back up, they'll be able to turn them back up relatively quickly. But,
look, as I said before, people signing up for long-term multi-hundred million dollar or billion dollar infrastructure on
the producer side, I don't think that that's in the cards in the near term.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. All right. That's helpful. Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you, John.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question on queue will come from the line of Becca Followill of U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line
is open. You may begin.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Becca. How are you?
<Q - Becca Followill>: Good. Thank you. Believe it or not, there's still questions. Broad Run was delayed a year. Can
you guys talk about that a little bit, why the year delay on that project?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: That was the Broad Run Expansion project, yeah. So we have the first tranche of Broad Run in
and that's up and running. We talked to our primary customer there, Antero, about whether they still wanted to pursue
the expansion project. They did but they were interested in, and we were interested in, in a delay in it. So we mutually
agreed to a delay.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Perfect. Thank you. And then along the same veins of the answer to the last question, in your
CO2 business, at what point do you start to put capital back to work? At what kind of commodity prices do you need to
see?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We have capital going to work there right now. We just elevated the return criteria to, as Kim
said, 15% unlevered after tax or better. We actually approved a project today that had a 43% return. These are small.
The capital program on CO2 is now just a little over $200 million. But we continue to approve small program spends in
the CO2 group. And I think that the easiest way to think about it, Becca, is where we've got an existing flood that's up
and running and so what we're doing is using shared facilities, maybe adding an injector, converting a current
producing well to an injector, drilling a new producing well. Well we've got all the other facilities, all the central
facilities in place. The incremental, the return on the incremental capital spend that we make is still attractive.
Now if you're talking about a brand new CO2 flood and getting one of those started, that's a ways off. I think you need
to see a fair amount of oil price recovery before you start to see it – $50, $55. You need to see significant oil price
recovery before you start to see that.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. And then last question on interest expense, a certain item was $69 million in
interest expense. Can you help us out with what that was?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: On the interest expense, is that the fair value accounting? Okay. So, Becca, when we –
and that should be a recurring certain item that happens every quarter. When we acquire other companies and assume
their debt, we have to fair value that debt. And once we fair value that debt, then the interest expense that we recognize
is not the same as the interest expense that is on the note and the interest expense that we pay. And so we classify the
difference as a certain item.

Thank you, ma'am. Next question on queue is coming from the line of Matthew Reustle of Goldman Sachs. Your line is
open. You may begin.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Matthew.
<Q - Matthew Reustle>: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. I understand the stance on funding CapEx through cash
flows, but just given the recent strength that we've had in the credit markets, any reason you don't consider tapping the
debt markets out of that $3 billion you have maturing in 2017?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We'll continue to watch the market and if we think it makes sense, you know, we may
do that at some point. But obviously, we don't need to.
<Q - Matthew Reustle>: Got it.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We don't need to, but we have the ability to if we – if it looks advisable.
<Q - Matthew Reustle>: Okay. And then just thinking about the leveraging strategy more broadly, sitting at 5.5 times
at the end of this year with $42 billion in debt, just the simple math is you could take out $4.5 billion of debt and that
would get you to five times or it could grow $900 million of EBITDA. How do you see that mix between debt pay
down and EBITDA growth pulling out to get you to that five times?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Well I think it'll be a combination of the fact that we're funding everything with 100%
retained cash flow, so 100% equity and then EBITDA that comes online from the projects.
<Q - Matthew Reustle>: Okay. Thank you. That's all I got.
Operator
Thank you, sir. The next question on the queue is coming from the line of Danilo Juvane of BMO Capital. Your line is
open. You may begin.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Good afternoon. Hello. Can you hear me?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Thanks for taking the question. With respect to the 6.7 times multiple, are there opportunities
for you guys to continue to realize cost reductions and scope improvements to get that even lower?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, I don't think they're dramatic, right? But we continue – we look at our projects every
month within the business units. Certain of them are looked at every week. And we're pressing our vendors fairly hard
to get concessions on construction costs, equipment and materials. You know, we have found scope that it turns out, on
closer examination, we don't need or we don't need right away. So we can either defer or eliminate those. And it's just
part of our normal process to – I mean, we've amped it up a little bit here but it's just part of the normal review process
to look for those. But they're not huge. They may be material to an individual project, but not huge in the overall
scheme of things. But I think we'll keep finding them.

Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from the line of Chris Sighinolfi. We have Corey Goldman of
Jefferies. Your line is open. You may begin.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Corey.
<Q - Corey Benjamin Goldman>: Hey. How's it going? Just a quick follow-up to Shneur's question on TMX. It looks
as though NEB pushed its final approval back since seven months. Steve, can you confirm it's just a one-quarter delay
on the in-service there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We're still aiming for end of – think of it as very end of 2019. So we had been looking at late
third quarter and, yeah, it's about a three-month delay.
<Q - Corey Benjamin Goldman>: Okay. Got it. I think this was a question I asked on the third quarter earnings call,
but given that some of the shippers do have an opt-out if costs do begin to creep, is there a specified date that you guys
have in mind in which you want to decide a go/no-go before? Or do you think shippers would have a go/no-go decision
if and when those costs do begin to creep up?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Let me lay out what the process is. We'll be getting – again, we have – we're looking at costs
right now, but we'll have our final conditions and know what all of our obligations are going to be, we think, December
or January, right. It's December for the federal process to conclude and I think, again, about in that same timeframe
we'll understand where we are with British Columbia. And then after that we owe our customers an updated cost
estimate. So you're talking about, to your question about timing, that's really a first quarter of next year event.
We don't have an update on the 6.8 because we're still evaluating what we think the projects are going to cost us – what
the project is going to cost us and it will be a bit dependent upon the conditions. I think a couple things. One is that
there is some cost pressure. The Canadian dollar has weakened relative to the U.S. dollar. A lot of the goods and
services are provided in U.S. dollar terms so there's been some pressure there. There have been some conditions that
we've agreed to and that have been added over time which has put some pressure on.
But I think at the end of the day what matters is do the customers want the project? And we still have very strong
interest from our shippers in the project and we even have interest from shippers who are not currently – customers,
potential customers who are not currently shippers on the project. So, we talk about this all the time, but I think this is
still a project that our customers want.
<Q - Corey Benjamin Goldman>: Got it. That was helpful. And then, Kim, if you can, can you just – I think you guys
were alluding to some movement in the CO2 volumes as it relates to 2016 and perhaps beyond. Can you just provide us
and update on hedges and the prices there from the Analyst Day, if any?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure. In 2017, we have 51% hedged at $68. In 2018 is 36% at $72. 2019 it's 24% at $60,
and in 2020 it's 6% at $49.
<Q - Corey Benjamin Goldman>: Okay. And 2016?

<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: This year, this is for the remainder of 2016, we're 77% hedged at $60, $30, $55.
<Q - Corey Benjamin Goldman>: Got it. Okay. And then if you can, last question from me. If you can remind me of
the $14.1 billion gross CapEx that you still have, how much is that considered overhead?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: It's right here.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Is that 5%?
<Q - Corey Benjamin Goldman>: Is that 5%?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Is that right, 5%?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, 5%.
<Q - Corey Benjamin Goldman>: Okay. So it's not a huge amount. But would you recommend capitalizing that 6.7
times multiple you're referring to, kind of including that in there?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yes.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We're including that.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yes. We're including that when are determining that. We're using the full $14.1 billion,
which includes overhead, less the CO2 CapEx. And then that's the 6.7 times multiple on that capital.
<Q - Corey Benjamin Goldman>: Perfect. Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys.

Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from Ross Payne of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. You may begin.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Ross, how are you doing?
<Q - Ross Payne>: Rich, doing well. Thank you. And, Rich, thank you so much for your clarification on the leverage.
You guys are obviously going to get to 5.5 times by the end of the year. Moving towards the 5.0 times, can you speak
to what is the progression for 2017 and 2018? When do you need to be at 5.0 times? What do you expect in 2017 in
terms of your leverage metrics as well? Thank you.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah, I think, Ross, we haven't done a 2017 plan yet. And so I don't have a projection
for you for exactly when we will get to the 5.0 times. But I think over the next couple of years we will get to the target,
and that's what Rich was referencing. At that point in time then we'll make a decision what to do with excess cash flow
beyond that point.
<Q - Ross Payne>: Okay. And do the credit agencies have certain levels that they have in mind for 2017 and 2018? Or
have they just thrown out the 2016 and then a general migration to the 5.0 times?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Well, let me tell you kind of, I think that the rating agencies based on our conversations
with them our current – are comfortable with our current rating and our current outlook. And I think at this point we are
funding 100% equity because we're using cash flow. And what we've said is we are going to use that cash flow to fund
our CapEx and to improve our balance sheet. And until we get that balance sheet improved to the 5.0 times target,
we're not going to do other things with that cash flow. So we will absent our cash flow going away, which as we said
every year for the last 18 years that we have very stable fee-based cash flow, we will have that cash flow, we will
improve our leverage metrics. And once that happens, then we'll look at other uses for our cash.
<Q - Ross Payne>: Great. Well, Kim, thank you so much for the clarification.
