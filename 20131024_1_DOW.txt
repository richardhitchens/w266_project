And I will now hand the call over to Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris
Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
Turning to slide 4. This quarter was another solid proof point in Dow's earnings growth momentum and our focus on
executing self-help measures, both strategic moves as well as tactical interventions to achieve top and bottom-line gains
in a perpetually slow growth world.
Here are the highlights. Adjusted earnings per share grew 19% year-over-year, representing our fourth consecutive
quarter of EPS growth. We delivered $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations, a 27% increase year-over-year.
Year-to-date, we have generated an additional $3.1 billion of cash flow from operations versus the prior year. Our
strong cash flow and strategic actions are allowing us to fund our organic growth and additional shareholder
remuneration.
Our focus on debt reduction, $200 million in the quarter and $2.4 billion year-to-date, drove our net debt to capital ratio
down to 34.7% below the low end of our historical range. We delivered solid EBITDA improvement led by our
Performance Plastics franchise, where our high-margin market focus and cost advantage enabled us to deliver EBITDA
growth of more than 30%. And notably, our Coatings and Infrastructure and Electronics and Functional Materials
businesses also delivered EBITDA gains up 15% and 5% respectively.
We continue to be proactive, and as you've seen through our consistent and persistent actions over the last 12 months,
Dow has a number of key catalysts in place that are fueling momentum, enhancing return on capital and driving higher
returns for our shareholders. We have a number of strategic business transitions in motion, including the signed
transaction on our Polypropylene Licensing and Catalysts business. Today, we announced additional financial
milestones aligned with further actions we are taking to go narrower and deeper into attractive markets and profit pools
and deselecting portions of value chains that are no longer core to our business.
But first, I will turn it over to Bill for more detail on our financial and operating results in the quarter.
William H. Weideman
Thank you, Andrew. Turning to slide 6, sales increased 1%, or 2% on an adjusted basis, to $13.7 billion. EBITDA was
$1.8 billion and earnings were $0.49 per share or $0.50 per share on an adjusted basis. This compares with earnings of
$0.42 per share in the same period last year.
Now, moving to slide 7 where you'll see the key drivers of our results this quarter. We drove aggressive price actions
across all businesses. However, the full benefit of these actions was offset by higher and volatile raw material costs.
Equity earnings grew $147 million year-over-year, led by our joint ventures in Kuwait. Further, our cost reduction
actions continue to gain traction, reaching $320 million year-to-date, and remain on track to deliver $500 million in
EBITDA by the year-end and $1 billion on a run rate basis by year-end 2014.
Now, let me take a moment to dive deeper into price and volume trends on page 8. We saw strong performance in
emerging geographies where both price and volume increases drove revenue gain of 5%. We also delivered strong
revenue gains in key end-use markets, including Electronic and Functional Materials, Coatings and Infrastructure,
Performance Packaging, and Agricultural Sciences. Volume grew 5% in Latin America and 3% in Asia-Pacific,
offsetting currency headwinds in both regions. Developed geographies volume declined, primarily due to previously

announced shutdowns, weak chlorine chain industry fundamentals and a lighter feedstock slate in Europe.
Now, turning to the operating segment, starting with Electronic and Functional Materials on slide 9, sales of Electronic
and Functional Materials were up 5% as volume growth of 6% more than offset a 1% decline in pri5ce. Ongoing strong
demand for functional films and OLED materials in mobile devices drove volume increases in Dow Electronic
Materials. Function materials delivered gains due to healthy fundamentals in the energy and home care sectors.
Now, turning to Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions, which grew sales 6% year-over-year. This is particularly notable
given the significant headwind this sector has faced over the last several years. EBITDA and EBITDA margins were up
15% and nearly 120 basis points respectively, reflecting the benefits of our targeted cost actions as well as improving
conditions in the construction market. Sales gains were broad-based, with increases across all businesses and all
geographic areas. Dow building construction grew volume in all regions. Strong sales in architectural coatings drove
growth in Dow coating materials, and sales growth in Dow Water and Process Solutions due to healthy demand in
reverse osmosis technologies in Asia-Pacific.
Now turning to Agricultural Sciences, which reported third quarter sales of $1.4 billion, up 8% versus the same period
last year. Crop protection sales increased 10%, representing a new quarterly record. Seeds, Traits and Oils sales and
EBITDA declined as cool, wet weather in the Northern Hemisphere led to higher seed returns in the quarter.
Now, moving to Performance Materials, where sales were down 3% versus the year-ago period. Volume gains in Dow
Automotive Systems and propylene oxide and propylene glycol were more than offset by a decline in other businesses,
most notably epoxy, driven by weak industry fundamentals. We achieved price gains in most business units. However,
this was more than offset by higher raw material costs, leading to margin contraction in portions of the chlorine value
chain, particularly epoxy, chlorinated organics, polyurethanes and propylene oxide and propylene glycol.
Now, turning to slide 11. Sales in Performance Plastics were $3.6 billion, up 3% compared with the same quarter last
year, or 6% excluding the impact of divestitures. Double-digit sales gains were achieved in North America and
Asia-Pacific with strong sales growth in Latin America. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics delivered strong sales
increases in flexible food and specialty packaging. EBITDA for this segment was up 32% versus the same period last
year, driven by broad-based price gains across all geographic areas.
In Feedstocks and Energy, sales were $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year. Price was flat while volume declined
7%. Volume decreases were driven by lower operating rates and lighter feedslate mix in Europe. Limited product
availability and caustic soda associated with planned turnarounds in the Gulf Coast also contributed to the decreased
volumes in this segment.
Now, let me turn to our cash flow and balance sheet, where we have made great progress. During the quarter, we
generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations, a 27% increase versus the same period last year. Our net debt to total
capital improved to 34.7%, down from 36.4% last quarter. Since 2010, we have reduced gross debt by $5.2 billion.
We're also delivering steady progress against our previously announced divestiture targets. As you know, in October,
we announced the signing of the divestiture of our Polypropylene Licensing and Catalysts business. As our cash flow
and earnings continue to grow, we remain focused on our three priorities: rewarding shareholders, funding organic
growth, and further reducing debt.
Before I wrap up, let me provide a few additional comments for modeling purposes. We expect to see the normal
seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter. We expect strong margins will continue in Performance Plastics, where we
will continue to monitor propylene to ethylene margins as we enter the winter months. We expect to see ongoing
growth in Agricultural Sciences. We expect equity earnings will be in the mid-$200 million range, and our
restructuring costs reduction actions will continue to ramp as we move into the fourth quarter, and we expect our tax
rate to be in the 26% to 28% range.
And now, I would like to turn it back over to Andrew.

Thank you, Bill. Dow delivered another solid quarter and remains on a strong path forward. Our earnings and cash
performance demonstrate our ability to execute in the face of uncertainty, and the debt reduction, cost control and
divestiture progress Bill just discussed are further proof that we are deploying every tool at our disposal to effectively
control the controllable. However, the reality remains we are operating within a global business environment that still
has not stabilized where volatility and uncertainty are clearly the new norm.
So if you turn to slide 14, we anticipated this ongoing volatility, which has fundamentally changed the way global
markets behave and the way our business must be prepared to respond. This is why over the previous 12 months we
have maintained a steady focus on driving improvements in return on capital to release value and we have consistently
provided progress reports on this plan.
For example, at our Investor Forum in 2012, using ROC as our lens, we shared our view on segment-specific plans to
enhance value. We then followed this with a closer look at how our focus on ROC was driving our investment
decisions and as a result, in the first quarter of this year, announced plans to divest $1.5 billion of non-strategic assets.
In the second quarter, we revealed additional work we had undertaken on underperforming units, unveiling plans for
broader portfolio optimization activities, mostly in the Performance Materials segment. And just last month, I shared
specific next steps with respect to these actions, including anticipated transactions within portions of our chlorine chain
and our commodity derivatives.
As a result of the steady ongoing focus and our deeper drill into ROC challenged business, if you turn to slide 15, today
we are announcing that we will accelerate our intermediate divestiture financial goal, moving from our initial target of
$1.5 billion, which is well underway, and expanding that to a financial milestone of $3 billion to $4 billion over the
next 18 months to 24 months.
The additional divestiture proceeds will come from the strategic decisions we are making regarding markets and value
chains within our chlorine portfolio. The decisions we have taken over these last many months have been underpinned
by a comprehensive analysis of the industries and markets we serve and our competitive position in these value chains
in order to determine the best market and portfolio combination to drive return on capital higher, invest in the right
markets and businesses and maximize shareholder value.
Turning to slide 16. Put simply, we are moving away from being all things to all markets and going deeper and
narrower into profit pools where Dow can extract value with our strong science and technology base and highly
competitive cost position. More than two-thirds or $40 billion of revenue of our businesses today are in the
high-margin attractive sectors such as electronics, packaging and agriculture, to name just a few. In these sectors, we
are working closely with customers to grow our technology and leadership position.
We also have roughly $10 billion of businesses located in markets where we expect demand to regain its pre-2008
crisis footing. These have strong underlying competitive advantages and are receiving further attention to enhance our
results. Our efforts are gaining traction. Take for example the Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions segment where our
costs and pricing actions, broader feedstock integration with our recently started up SAMCo JV in Saudi Arabia and
improving market fundamentals in construction, infrastructure and housing resulted in both top and bottom-line growth
for the first time in more than seven consecutive quarters. However, this analysis has also illuminated the fact that we
have businesses we believe serve markets that are not best suited for Dow long-term. In these businesses, we have solid
low cost competitive positions and are currently using a run for cash business model and have identified the path of
transaction as forthcoming for several.
So turning to slide 17, take for example our chlorine chain where today's downstream market choices drive our future
integration needs. Making these choices is not an all or nothing decision. While we are driving aggressive plans to
improve these businesses, we believe a different owner is better positioned to extract maximum value long-term from
portions of our chlorine and derivatives assets such as epoxy resins, chlorinated organics and the vinyls chain. Due to
the complexity associated with this collection of businesses, it may take multiple steps and structures to unlock the full
value of these assets. We're very conscious in the carve-out process not to leave any stranded costs and create negative
synergies. From a timing perspective, you can expect the scope to further crystallize over the next six months.

Turning the slide 18, specifically for the epoxy business, note that this has historically been a terrific business with
EBITDA margins approaching 20% and we believe that it is capable of becoming a strong business again. However,
recent and widely acknowledged industry overbuilding especially in China has been a significant headwind towards
profitability. In 2012, we proactively addressed these challenges head-on, shuttering non-performing assets through our
restructuring programs. And we are running this business in a low cost operationally excellent manner, leveraging our
advantage cost positions. The team is focused and aligned with both strategic and operational plans firmly in place to
deliver improvements. We are running a lean organization and running it for cash, streamlining our geographic
structure, driving clear accountability to gain share and increase earnings and prioritizing our R&D investment in favor
of reliably delivering core Dow products to the epoxy market, all firmly in place to aggressively further reduce
additional costs across the business.
And while we have a dedicated team focused on fixing and improving profitability by $100 million in the near-term, as
I mentioned in September, we are evaluating various options to reduce our participation in the epoxy-based value
chain. Put simply, we believe these are great assets. However, as we have carefully evaluated the markets serve by the
epoxy business, it is clear these markets no longer align with Dow's strategic priorities. Therefore, we are looking to
transact this business either via joint venture or a sale and we see this transaction taking place in the near-term. We
have and will continue to give you updates as we progress on this dual track plan.
Turning to slide 19 and to our polyurethanes franchise which serves a broad range of sectors. Here, we remain
convinced that through our chemistry and materials science capabilities, we can win in select end-use markets that offer
attractive growth. And as we go narrower and deeper into these strategically aligned markets, we continue to optimize
our participation across their value chains.
First, we have real [inaudible] (19:02) focus in the four key sectors shown on this slide, drilling deeper where value is
highest. Second, we are optimizing our participation in every step of the value chain. We are focusing on operational
excellence in our components businesses and rightsizing our systems business for new market realities, particularly in
Western Europe. We have shuttered six assets over the last 12 months and reduced structural costs through streamlining
the organization.
Going forward, we expect our cost reduction actions in polyurethanes to provide an additional $100 million of benefit
to the bottom-line. And third, we are investing for higher and more sustainable margins in the long-term by securing
attractive cost advantage feedstock positions through both our PDH project on the U.S. Gulf Coast as well as our
Sadara joint venture. Bottom-line, we are confident that the fixed actions we are taking now will deliver meaningful
improvement for polyurethanes and the longer-term fundamentals of our portfolio remain attractive for earnings
growth.
Turning to slide 20, these portfolio actions and many other previously stated self-help measures of the cost and cash
intervention type, complemented by value drivers such as Sadara and our new earnings streams, including the U.S.
Gulf Coast, plus new EBITDA from innovation totaled more than $3 billion of EBITDA in the near-term. These
catalysts, plus several external factors, including lower pension expense, leverage from higher operating rates and
tightening of ethylene balances, will allow our EBITDA trajectory to go north of $10 billion. These actions are in
motion and fully funded in our CapEx and expense plans, and therefore, we are confident that we have the projects and
programs to deliver this near-term earnings growth.
Turning to slide 21, in fact, when you combine our strong cash flow from operations with which we aggressively paid
down debt and reduced interest expense, the cash generation from our embedded catalysts, which I just mentioned, and
finally, the cash from our accelerated divestiture targets, this company is well-positioned to execute against our stated
cash priorities, reduce interest expense from the balance sheet, fund our organic growth agenda, and reward our
shareholders.
So let me now turn to our outlook, where the global economic recovery has been hesitant and growth has been slow and
spotty at best. On slide 23, despite a number of positive underlying market fundamentals, political uncertainties in key
regions continue to hinder economic recovery. China is stabilizing. And looking ahead, we see fundamentals improving
for stronger growth in 2014. However, heading into the fourth quarter, we have yet to see a clear uptick in holiday

export demand.
A weaker yen is bolstering exports in Japan. The resulting increase in industrial production momentum is positively
impacting industries, such as automotive. We view a corresponding uptick in consumer and manufacturing confidence
as a positive catalyst for business investments in the region. Conditions in Europe remained soft, however. In our view,
the market has found bottom, and we expect to see more positive singles in the near-term than in the previous three
years, especially in the northern zone countries.
Volatile currency conditions are driving cautious purchasing patterns in Latin America, especially in Brazil. However,
the fundamentals in particular for agriculture and packaging remain quite strong in this region. And finally, despite
recent paralysis in Washington, the U.S. is, on the whole, demonstrating stable albeit slow growth with demand in a
number of key end-use markets, including automotive, durable goods, residential new construction, agriculture and
packaging. We remain concerned that the ongoing dysfunctionality will cause U.S. GDP to slow versus the original
2014 forecast of 3%.
So against this backdrop of uncertain and a volatile global environment, we are focused on controlling what we can
control and we will continue to demonstrate significant progress. These self-help measures serve as a strong bridge to
the new EBITDA streams that will start surfacing in a big way once our Sadara plant starts up in 2015 and the other
aforementioned value drivers kick in.
We remain squarely focused on three key areas: selecting and winning in the right markets, going deep, not wide;
adjusting our portfolio and driving unrelenting financial and operating discipline using ROC as our lens, and
distributing surplus cash so as to maximize shareholder value. With our intense focus on higher operating performance,
coupled with the ongoing ramp-up of our self-help measures, we have all the right levers in place, and we will be
undeterred in our actions to further increase shareholder returns.
With that, I will turn things back over to Doug for Q&A.
Doug May
Great. Thank you, Andrew. Now, we will move on to your questions. First, however, I would like to remind you that
my comments earlier regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our
prepared remarks and the following Q&A.
Lorie, would you please explain the Q&A procedure?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Yeah, good morning and thanks for taking my call or question. With regard to the debt load
that you're carrying, you've dropped the debt load pretty significantly with all the cash flow that you've been generating
and now you're talking about divesting $3 billion to $4 billion. So I guess can you walk us through how much further
you expect to bring down the debt load, and then at what point might we start to see cash getting returned to the
shareholder in a different way, whether it's share buybacks or a bigger dividend or what have you?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Sure. Hi, John, this is Bill. You are exactly right. As you know that our net debt to total
cap has come down significantly due to the purposeful actions we've taken over the last four or five years reducing debt
by $5 billion. And you are right. As Andrew pointed out in his comments, with both our expectation of strong cash
flow generation plus the proceeds, we'll have a lot of flexibility going forward. If I think of debt, John, this is the way
that I think of it. It's not so much that I'm shooting for a specific target on net debt to total cap. We will continue to

reduce debt, but it's primarily to reduce interest costs which will increase our earnings and will give us the flexibility to
return that more to shareholders. So as you think about our debt, we will continue to bring down debt. It will be focused
on our higher cost percentage debt but it's primarily to liberate more earnings.
At the same time, we will also fund our growth projects that we've laid out. But clearly, as you pointed out, we're going
to have a lot more cash to return to shareholders, both in terms of increased dividends and share repurchase. So we're in
a very good position and the key message is we have a lot of flexibility going forward.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Just to add, John, I mean, accelerating share repurchase and address the dividend.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Great. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, on the $3 billion to $4 billion of
divestitures coming, it sounds like some of the businesses are really struggling right now, some are maybe doing at
least okay. How should we think about the earnings power of those businesses and the potential loss of that as you sell
them over the next 12 months to 18 months or 18 months to 24 months?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: So, John, the scoping here matters a lot, and as you know from our previous conversations
with many of you, the electrochemical unit, the chlorine part of that unit, feeds a lot of our value-add businesses
downstream. So decoupling the commodity pieces such as epichlorohydrin, such as chlorinated organics, such as
vinyls, if you decouple it and think about those, we don't actually lose a lot of EBITDA, because we would not strand –
that's my comments on my prepared remarks. We're not going to leave any stranded costs.
The vinyls chain is quite well off here in the United States. PVC guys are enjoying a good domestic market as well as
exports based on low cost natural gas. So between caustic soda, chlorinated organics and Epoxy, these are basically
single-digit EBITDA in the Dow context. And frankly, we will basically see an improvement in our [indiscernible]
(28:32) because we'll be less commodity, and frankly, the EBITDA on our second quarter earnings call is there for you
to see and it's basically $5 billion of revenue and roughly $450 million of EBITDA.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Could you decompose the volume decline in North America a little bit for us? So you were
down 2% and, again, that's your most cost-advantaged region. It shouldn't have had as much impact perhaps from
margin pressure from higher feedstocks, but maybe decompose that a little bit in terms of where the volume weakness
and was it up excluding chlorinated products in North America?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: So, look, price/volume in North America for plastics was at its max. So the unit that did
very well, plastics, was up by about 9% on price and down a little bit on volume, and that actually tells you a North
America story, that and the seeds return in ag, which was commented on the call on our prepared remarks. If you look
across most of the units that were strong, EE&FM were up 8%, driven by functional materials. C&I was up 5%. So
really, the one you highlighted, which was the Performance Materials chlorine chain, specifically, epoxy, was the one
that was most affected plus a little bit on the Feedstocks and Energy unit because of a caustic turnaround.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Okay. And why would you expect the normal seasonal decline in the fourth quarter when you
seem to be entering it with a little bit weaker trends than normal?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: You mean the Performance Plastics or in general, the volumes?
<Q - John E. Roberts>: I think it was a general comment about expecting a normal seasonal decline in the fourth
quarter.

<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. Well, Q4 for Dow has always been on our mix, the slowest of our four quarters.
That's because the December month factories shutdown and not just in the United States but around the world. That
comes to the comment on exports out of China. If the Chinese go into December running, then that comment will
change. But typically, what we see is a slow December. In fact, the second two weeks of December are almost
non-existent.

Our next question comes from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments.
<A - Doug May>: Hi, Peter.

and we think we know where it's going. But it sounds like your outlook for the 2015, 2016 period is a lot different than
what Wall Street has incorporated in their earnings estimates. And you've been talking this $10 billion EBITDA target.
How much better could it be in 2015, 2016 because there have got to be a lot of pluses coming out of the bad period
that we're going through?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes. Hi, Peter. The slide that refers to your point, 2015 is literally around the corner. I think
the closer 2015 gets here, the startup of Sadara and the startup of our U.S. Gulf Coast PDH unit as well as, of course,
the second project we have down on the U.S. Gulf Coast, post-St. Charles. St. Charles is up and running, doing great as
slide 20 indicates, the Louisiana ethane flexibility project, which is the conversion down there of the naphtha cracker to
crack more ethane. Those are all going to hit 2015 timeframe without much of a global economy tailwind behind it. If
you say the global economies are around a 3%, 3.5% number, all things being equal, there's also a polyethylene plastic
cycle in front of us as well, which is one of the things that's on slide 20.
So we believe quite confidently in the $10 billion number 2015 and on. And between now and then, it's really a
bridging over by being aggressive portfolio managers on commoditized underperforming units. Therefore, John
McNulty's question, taking out lower ROC will improve the ROC of the company, release value as the 2015 catalysts
hit. Sadara starts up, U.S. Gulf Coast starts up, and an ethylene cycle occurs as well as our DAS Enlist launch. This is
north of $10 billion, Pete.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: You didn't mention ag in this. From the outside, it looks like you could have a heck of a good
ramp-up in your ag chemical earnings over the next couple of years.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes. So I mentioned Enlist just then, but I can definitely tell you that we believe ag will
double its value from here in these next several years based on those launches. It's doubled in value in the last three to
five years. It's got the seeds, traits and oils businesses about to approach breakeven. We'll release a lot more value once
that is no longer in negative territory. Enlist itself is an accelerator. SmartStax has done really terrifically, and then all
the ag chem launches that we put out there, which have been – whether they be herbicides or insecticides – have been
knocking it out of the park, but Dow's earning power is greater than $1.4 billion in 2015.

Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, Dave.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Andrew, of that $10 billion in EBITDA, how would you break down between
the commodity-sensitive earnings and more value-add earnings in that number?

<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: So I was just at the plastics exhibition at K. Every three years we have big participation in
that as most plastics guys do. What's very notable about our plastics mix today versus the three-year ago K is the
disappearance of all the commodity plastics. And our customer base there that was there in droves, when they looked at
Dow, they saw packaging, specialty plastics, specialty elastomers, all high-value plastics which are far less commodity
sensitive. And the way we think about plastics today is value-add and the low-cost feedstock piece we're locking in
through U.S. Gulf Coast and Sadara has way less volatility. We are de-emphasizing the naphtha and oil molecule in the
plastics mix. As a consequence of that: way more reliable earnings and way less sensitivity to volatility in the $10
billion. The increment from $8 billion to $10 billion, north of $10 billion, has way less volatility or way lower beta than
the previous Dow of three or four or five years ago.
And the way I also view that is we're running at a very high EBITDA number right now, equivalent to what we had in
2005. We have the Rohm and Haas businesses all performing well, coatings and infrastructure has hit its stride, we
have EM and FM doing great. And so the Rohm and Haas businesses have really brought down our volatility. Our ag
business has brought down our volatility, and we've changed plastics so it's less volatile. And we're getting out of the
volatile pieces like Epoxy, like commodity chlorine. So that answers your question, I hope.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: It does. And just lastly on Q3 and Performance Plastics, sequentially what was the delta on
maintenance and turnaround costs in Q3 versus Q2 Performance Plastics?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Do you have the number, Bill?
<A - William H. Weideman>: It was down. I don't have the exact number in front of me, but it was – the turnaround
third versus second was in the $20 million to $30 million kind of range.

Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays Capital.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Good morning, Duffy.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Good morning. I wonder if you could flesh out a little bit more, Andrew, you talked about $5
billion in sales from the stuff that could be separated, $450 million in EBITDA, and we increased the potential
proceeds about $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. On a sales multiple, that looks like 0.3 to 0.5 times, which feels pretty light
for those businesses. Can you just walk through what some of those might look like if those numbers are right? And if
that $3 billion to $4 billion is selling everything or if there are some JVs built into that as well?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, hi, Duffy. You probably answered your own question. I mean certainly that is not –
you should not equate that $5.5 billion of revenue roughly with the $3 billion to $4 billion at all. Because, firstly, the $3
billion to $4 billion includes the $1.5 billion we had already talked about. The increase of roughly $1.5 billion to $2
billion is only part of the scope of that $5.5 billion. And frankly, includes joint ventures. And so there are structural
topics in there like MLPs, there's some infrastructure, there's some energy assets. We're not done. That $3 billion to $4
billion is today's number. We've got more work to do. This is not a simple carve-out. We are working hard on that. You
saw us do Styron. When we finally formed Styron, separated it, and then had a lot to say about what we wanted to do
with Styron. It obviously consists of a lot of businesses that you weren't even expecting. So you should see us continue
to go down that path. We're working on modules, modules within that $5.5 billion and over time you'll expect to get
more updates from us.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Okay. Thank you. And then on DAS, it seemed like some more cost running through some
returns. How much of the returns was actual DAS seed versus how much of that would have been maybe license seeds
that came back and you had to eat some of that, and how healthy do you think your seed business is set up for next year
with some increased cost running through the corn seed business in the U.S.?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, Duffy, let me answer that. So from the seed return standpoint, that was really
driven from the wet and cold weather in the Northern Hemisphere, primarily the U.S. It wasn't any specific, I mean,

licensing or anything like that. It was really just due to returns due to smaller acreage in terms of plantations.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Mostly our seeds.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, exactly, our seeds. So going forward, we expect actually the seeds in the ag
business to bounce back in the fourth quarter, and actually, we believe we're going to have a strong 2014. So this is just
a little bit of anomaly actually this quarter due to seed returns, again, due to wet weather and cold weather we had.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: And I would say we see Q3 therefore as an anomaly, the bottom-line. And you should take
nothing from what happened in that quarter vis-à-vis Q4 or 2014.

Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Good morning. Andrew, some of these chlorine derivatives are underperforming and you upped
your divestiture target. If that's the case, I mean, how do you think about the chlorine longer-term? Do you think Dow
wants to be in the chlorine business?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: All right. It's a terrific question, P.J. when you consider the context of your question for
many people on this phone, in fact, all of us, we have 117 years of history in chlorine. This management team is very
driven to put financial strategic criteria against every part of our portfolio. And the strategic criteria around chlorine has
been and now for the last five to seven years around value-add chlorine for our downstream businesses like, for
example, ag chemicals. As we did the Mitsui deal, Dow-Mitsui Chlor-Alkali, it was indicative to us that there were a
lot of people out there that really wanted to play in the vinyls chain for PVC, particularly when they saw the low cost
shale gas. So we consider it a valuable asset, but no longer maybe valuable to us because of the other criteria, which is
to de-commoditize our earnings and really invest in IP and the value-add. So therefore, we can move some of that
capital off of our books.
And frankly, that is driving us now to actually achieve, in essence, the de-volatilization of our earnings as well as
taking down some capital and reallocating that capital to better market choices. Commodity chlorine, others can do that
and they can play in PVC. For us, we will use our chlorine at competitive cost for our value-add, but we have market
choices, for example, the Plastics Packaging business; for example, the ag business; for example, electronic materials
business, where we would rather put Dow's precious capital for greater shareholder return. So it's frankly, we're
drawing the line higher up on ROC and higher up on a lower beta in terms of volatility of earnings and then going
deeper in certain markets.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: And just quickly on these divestitures, you have several of them lined up.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Do you have the deals in to handle that? And then secondly, how do you maximize value? Do you
have a standardized auction process that you will run through? Thank you.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes. I use Styron as a great indicator. We've done $8 billion of divestments in these last
five years. Remember, we did some of them in the middle of the crisis. We have an incredibly good team on the
carve-out side, very focused teams on, for example, epoxy right now. Epoxy has a very focused group of people. We
brought in one of our leaders from the Pacific, Pat Dawson, brought him back and given him that full-time job to run
epoxy, run it for cash, run it for maximized value, and then over time, we'll transact. And this is the sort of thing we've
got in place. Bill's got his M&A team, we've got our joint venture teams, and we can parallel process this and execute
against these divestments without interrupting our valued growth activities.

<A - William H. Weideman>: If I could just add to that, P.J., as Andrew mentioned, we have a different team working
on those. So we have a team completing and exceeding the $1.5 billion, we have a team specifically focused on the
chlorine derivatives, specific focus on epoxies. So we've done very much a divide-and-conquer approach here.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: One more add, by the way, sorry to beat on about this, but it's a powerful question. As you
saw with plastic additives, we also are going to pull things off the market if we don't get the value that we believe
they're worth. This is not a fire sale. This is not a need for liquidity. This is not a need even for the balance sheet. This
is a decision to allocate capital at its highest value for our long-term profitable growth.

Our next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Hey, good morning, Bob.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Good morning. Andrew, I wanted to ask a little bit about the cost savings initiatives. It sounds
like they're really going to ramp up in the fourth quarter. I think your slide suggests going from a $320 million
delivered to $500 million delivered achievement, which means a big chunk in the fourth quarter. So I wanted to make
sure that math seems right to you and maybe get granularity on how it ramps that much. And when I look at the
corporate expense line, in the last several quarters, it's been down nicely every quarter and this quarter it moved up, or
sorry, it didn't move down nearly as much. So it was more flattish. So is there something unique and specific to this
quarter there?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Hi, Bob, this is Bill. So your math is right. So year-to-date, our cost savings is $320
million and at the end of the year, we said $500 million. So if you do your math there, we'd expect in the $180 million
kind of range. And the reason is that continues to ramp up as part of the people reduction where we've eliminated about
70% of those positions, and so that will – the additional reductions coming in the fourth quarter, plus the full impact of
the workforce reductions we've done. But your math is exactly right. So you can expect that to ramp in the order of
magnitude of another $180 million in the fourth quarter.
As far as the corporate segment, there's lots of different things in the corporate segment. You've got insurance and other
things in there. But actually, it's right within the range that we had provided there. You're right. It's about flat with a
year ago. As I recall, it was like $218 million this quarter, which is really in line with. And going forward, you should
expect that to be in the $200 million to $250 million, but more on the lower side. And as we go forward, in 2014, you
will continue to see more cost reductions that will impact corporate too, so...
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: And then, Andrew, I think you mentioned epoxies was once upon a time a pretty bright star
with nearly 20% EBITDA margins. To try and figure out how much you might get if you were to monetize that, can
you give us a sense where margins are today?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes. So they're single-digit EBITDA percent margins, and so we really have seen
overcapacity and if you look at China, they have built a lot of their conversions of epico – from acetylene plants,
epichlorohydrin plants, really was done without market dynamics which is not atypical of Chinese state-owned
enterprises. So whether it's Asian producers in epoxy like the Taiwanese or the Chinese in epy and [indiscernible]
(46:24), they've oversupplied that and the wind energy business disappearing because of loss of subsidies, particularly
in Europe and the U.S. I mean these have been big dynamics that have come in a hurry. By the way, just slide 18 on the
second quarter deck has the specific EBITDA number, but a high-single digits. So the consequence of all this, Bob, is
really, you really don't want to put a lot of R&D against a commoditizing business. Dow has really good assets in
epichlorohydrin, the two low cost assets in the world; one in Germany, one out in Texas.
Those assets can be run for cash as long as you don't burden them with extra cost structures downstream. There are
other producers out there who are way more downstream than us that choose to do the value-add downstream. I believe

those businesses will commoditize with time. So in terms of getting value, I think there's also an equal chance that this
should be a combination with someone else, because of these industries hurting as much as a pure sale. Having said
that, our focus is to run it for cash, improve the value and then take it from there.

Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Hey, just talking about cost savings, I really liked the ad that
Accenture took out on your behalf in terms of using chemical symbols and so forth, so very eye-catching. On the epoxy
side, Andrew, you're saying that it could very well be a JV as well but that would still leave you vulnerable to the
volatility of that business. Or would you be thinking that if you were to do a JV that the amount of synergies that could
be taken out would be such that the overall negative part that epoxy is putting into Dow portfolio would be mitigated
somewhat?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. I think the way you should think about JV is not, Frank, is not unlike the Dow-Mitsui
Chlor-Alkali JV, where – that one's a pure 50/50, but that was a big synergy play based on brownfield investments we
had that we could incrementalize the new build. This case, the synergy is we have two very low cost upstream assets,
so somebody else who has a lot of downstream assets, so that could be restructuring.
So I don't want to foreshadow the actual deal, of course. But in essence, there would be synergies available. And then
over time, we don't have to be even a 50% owner. We could even start out on a low ownership. This thing could be a
beautiful part of somebody's private equity portfolio. This could be even a spin-out as a standalone epoxy business.
These niche specialty chemical companies that are run with a very low cost base and with some value-add but very
focused, I mean, this could be very attractive to some small portfolio somewhere.
So long story short, as I said, it was a great business. It can be a good business. But for us, it's way too volatile and
given where we are in terms of our portfolio allocation process, it's a good time to look at better owners.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right, terrific. That's helpful. And I guess I wanted just to ask the question, obviously, with
the balance sheet getting healthier and healthier and getting even more healthy with these asset disposals and so forth.
What are your thoughts about possibly going on the other side of the aisle and doing some acquisitions in more
specialty type businesses and bolstering strategic parts of Dow?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: So I'll let Bill maybe chime in, but I think I'm probably going to make it redundant by
saying look, Frank, we're going to focus all of this balance sheet work on our shareholder. We've built a portfolio that
has been tremendously hard to build over these last five to seven years. Our shareholders have been extremely patient.
We're going to release value, and Bill is going to take down interest cost for releasing earnings but that's releasing
value, and we're going to gear this to our shareholder. It's very important that we keep getting better, not bigger. And I
think this is the march on ROC. Did you want to add anything?
<A - William H. Weideman>: I think I would just add, Andrew, we just don't feel there's a need to go out and do any
M&A. We've made that clear but I'll just reinforce it one more time. We have enough growth things that we've laid out,
U.S. Gulf Coast, et cetera, that we'll fund, that we think will do much better returns than we could ever get in an M&A
deal.

<A - William H. Weideman>: Oh, hi.
<Q - Rob Walker>: Hi, guys. I guess what was your global operating rate in the quarter? And I guess post your
divestment target, what would that rate increase to?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, the operating rate in the quarter was 82%. And I'm not sure I understood the
second question.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Post-divestment, what will it be?
<Q - Rob Walker>: Yeah, looking a few years out, how much could that operating rate be higher so you...
<A - William H. Weideman>: I don't know, Rob. Obviously, up from where it is today. And so but we would – it's all
going to depend on the scope and obviously the economy and stuff. But I would say definitely higher than it was today
and in the third quarter it was 82%.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, and notably by the way, the plastics chain is running in the early 90%s and the
crackers are all running in the low 90%s. So different parts of the outfit are running below obviously 80%. So where
we're taking out capacity and where we are divesting is in the parts that are running below 80%. So therefore, Bill's
mathematical answer is correct. It should go higher than 82%.
<Q - Rob Walker>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Doug May>: Maybe time for one or two more questions, Lorie.
<Q - Rob Walker>: Yeah, I guess just excluding the businesses you're targeting for divestiture, any sense how the
remainder of the business performed in the quarter and what would be the return on capital of that business roughly
versus your current level, say, by year end 2015?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Just real quick. As far as how the business has operated in the quarter, I mean, we made
those comments during our thing. But Electronic and Functional Materials had a good quarter, up year-over-year, very
solid EBITDA returns. Coatings and Infrastructure, as Andrew mentioned, we're starting to see that business improve.
And so year-over-year improvement and we believe that trend will continue. We believe we are going to start seeing
now year-over-year improvements there. Ag was a little bit of an anomaly this quarter. We expect it's going to bounce
back forward.
Performance Materials delivering very strong earnings and we expect that will continue. And Performance Materials,
as we've highlighted, that one is where our – we're really focused on improving returns there. And then Feedstocks and
Energy was down a little bit, but that was all really related to the feedstock slate in Europe. So most all of our
businesses, with the exception of Performance Materials, did actually quite well in year-over-year comparisons.

<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: It's a great question. So, Mark, if you go back to Dow's integration strategy over decades,
chlorine, ethylene, propylene, and then benzene and aromatics, all form the foundation molecules. We took a big
decision five, seven years ago around the aromatics part, right? So you can see that was Styron. And that was not an
easy carve-out but one that we could pull off without stranding, adding negative costs and hurting our strategy going
forward on value-add. So now you're correctly addressing the chlorine piece, because we've got ethylene, we've got
propylene, and we believe those are essential molecules for our value-add. That integration will never change based on
the current portfolio.
But certainly on this portfolio piece, we're now looking at which are chlorine derivatives that are commoditizing.
Remember, this is not of our own volition. We are basically seeing overbuilding going on. If there was a medium-term
structural fix, we probably would have recommended it by now. But in essence, the chlorine vinyls piece of this has not
been our strategy for some years ever since we basically let the Shintech contract go the way it did. Why? Because we
wanted PVC, they work. So other companies are in PVC so that always made sense. We could pull that off without
really hurting our chlorine integration strategy. So now we're doing the next layer of it, which is there is epoxy resins,
there's chlorinated organics. These are commoditizing. We believe we can pull it off without changing the integration
strategy.

for corn – target for corn?

And our final question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Andrew, it looks like exports are starting to exert a bit more pressure on propane. Can
you speak to that market and how it's influenced your feed mix, propylene derivatives, and whether or not it's had any
impact on your Performance Plastics profitability?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: It's certainly in the quarter and in this next quarter, the propane run-up is a mismatch
between fractionation capacity coming on and export capacity being built, so the exports played a factor into the rise in
propane. But at the end of the day, it doesn't change the direction arrows here in terms of – Kevin, in terms of the
market being long globally for as far as the eye can see. So if you export into a globally long market, it'll keep the
domestic number down. We believe that the long-term price will trend higher with WTI, but on a lower ratio, probably
around 50% to 55% than in the past, because these new supplies out of fractionation will come, and over a meaningful
timeframe will outpace exports and other demand.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: And a quick follow-up, if I may, for Bill. How much might your pension expense decline
in 2014?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, so every 100 basis point increase in interest rate, which is about where we are
today is going to be a little bit – reduces our interest expense about $250 million. So if interest rates stay because it's
based on a discount – if interest rates stay about where they are today, you could expect our interest expense to be
down roughly $250 million next year and could be a little bit more. You also had the significant impact on our funded
ratio. Every 100% basis point changes our funding balance about $2 billion, so that's another data point.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Great. Thank you.

Yeah, I mean I would also like to highlight some of the questions that are being asked. Our commitment to get to north
of $10 billion is absolutely resolute. We have a medium-term catalyst for 2015. 2015 is not a far timeframe. In the short
timeframe, the cost and cash interventions that were asked about appearing in Q4, I mean, against all the volatility
that's out there, we believe the market is getting better. So 2014 should be better than 2013. And we believe that by
making the decisions we have on the bottom part of the portfolio in terms of ROC will liberate value and liberate value
to earnings off the balance sheet, and then keep raising, if you like, our shareholder remuneration.
So that's the storyline. We had a September volatility on hydrocarbons that we didn't give in the price increases but,
frankly, we believe that the year-on-year was very strong and we'll continue to execute against same.
