Sean M. Connolly
Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before we get into our second quarter
performance, as I often do, I want to take a minute and touch upon the big picture at Hillshire Brands with a quick
overview of our core beliefs around how we will create strong value for our shareholders over the long run. Hillshire
Brands is a growth-oriented food company with market leading iconic brands and when we talk about growth, we're
talking about both sales and profitability and to do so sustainably. Accordingly, we believe in a very consistent and
disciplined approach to brand building and innovation across our portfolio.
We also believe in improving cost efficiency in order to fuel our growth agenda. We've been unwavering in this regard
and we will continue to be that way. As a management team that is building a new culture, we're constantly working to
insure that cost efficiency is a mindset and not a program. We are now more than halfway through the second year of
our plan to build an agile, consistently performing food company and we feel very confident about the path we're on to
create a winner for our shareowners, employees, and other stakeholders.
Now, let's jump into Q2 and our outlook for the year. I'm pleased to report strong results in the second quarter of fiscal
2014, as both sales and EPS grew at rates higher than we previously expected. To do this we had to effectively manage
through a much more challenging input cost environment than we originally envisioned and we will continue to have to
navigate this dynamic throughout the second half of the fiscal year. Our actions will include the launch of our most
exciting innovation slate yet and backing it with increased marketing support. When you add it all up, we now expect
full year EPS to come in near the high end of the previously provided range.
As you know, we're committed to building momentum on our brands as we move through the back half of the fiscal
year. The first half of this year was important in terms of laying the foundation for that momentum. We expanded
distribution on innovations we launched late in fiscal 2013, we also introduced additional new products into the market
and you see several of them on the left side of this slide.
And we continue to support our brands with solid MAP investment, including robust advertising programs on Jimmy
Dean and Ball Park. We also recently reactivated advertising on Hillshire Farm lunchmeat, which comes on the heels of
a very successful period of trade merchandising that grew household penetration, an impressive 2 points. And finally,
we continued to expand our unique Aidells in-store sampling capability with a particular focus on the new gourmet
chicken meatballs that are performing very well.
The bottom line is, these programs continue to have an impact and what you see on this slide is multi-outlet sales
results from the retailer scanner data. Overall, you see very solid performance in the quarter with Jimmy Dean and
Aidells continuing to lead the way. We're also beginning to see trend improvement on challenged businesses like State
Fair and Sara Lee Desserts, which is encouraging.
As I did last quarter though, I want to remind you that as we take pricing to help offset inflation, some of these trends
may be pressured in the months ahead. Nevertheless, we clearly like what we see.
Now, you just saw the relatively stable performance on Hillshire Farm lunchmeat on the previous slide. This slide helps
put that performance in perspective. From a volume shipment standpoint, Q2 was flat against a very strong 6% increase
in Q2 last year. The key takeaway here is that Hillshire Farm lunchmeat has rebounded nicely from the self-infected dip
we encountered in the back half of last year and importantly, the brand is now shifting its marketing mix back to our
preferred approach of focusing on advertising and innovation, not trade promotion and the consumer appears to be
tracking with us.
Now, let's get into the facts on inflation. We expected input costs to be higher this year, but not anything like what
we've experienced. The increases we've seen in the pork and beef markets exceeded all of our forecasts and have driven
major cost increases. As I told you last quarter, this is no longer a first half concept and versus our last call, we now
expect second half inflation to be even higher, which will clearly pressure gross margins versus what we envisioned at
that time.

The net of this is threefold. First, we will continue to be relentless on costs, both tightening our belt on discretionary
spend and continuing to deliver our formal cost programs. Second, we're taking broader pricing actions than we
anticipated last quarter. Those actions are underway now and we will monitor them carefully with our very capable
integrated margin management team. By the way, that team does expect elasticities to be a bit less favorable than what
we experienced in Q2. Much of that pricing was on seasonal items that we believe benefit from higher loyalty
associated with the holiday recipe usage of the products.
That leads me to the third action we're taking, which is to mitigate this elasticity effect in the back half with increased
MAP support and a very robust innovation slate. Regarding innovation, recall our long-term goal is to be generating
between 13% and 15% of our annual revenue from items launched in the prior three years. Historically, we hovered
around 9% on this metric and last year we improved that number to 11%, and in the second half of this year, we have
exciting new innovations coming on a number of our core brands and some new news from our Golden Island
acquisition as we build our presence in the very promising jerky category. We're looking forward to sharing more
details on these new products at CAGNY in a few weeks. I think you'll like them when you see them and I think you'll
like them even better when you taste them.
Now, before I turn it over to Maria, let me summarize what I expect in the months ahead. Clearly, we now expect to see
significantly higher inflation throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, and given a critical part of our margin
management strategy is to recover inflation with pricing over time, we are in the process of broadening our pricing
actions from what we did in the first half, but we don't rely on pricing alone. Our cost programs will make major
contributions in the second half as well.
And to keep our consumers with us through the current environment, we need to keep our brand presence very strong.
To do that, we have increased our MAP plan for the back half of the year and aligned it with a terrific innovation slate.
On guidance, we now expect EPS to come in near the high end of the previously provided range, which is clearly a
positive development. And last, but certainly not least, we remain highly active in our pursuit of winning acquisitions.
With that, Maria, over to you.
Maria Henry
Thanks, Sean. Good morning everyone thanks for joining us. Before I jump into the numbers, let me give you my quick
summary of the quarter.
Overall, we delivered strong financial results in a very challenging input cost environment. I think about our stronger
than expected earnings coming from three areas. One, our performance was better in some areas than we expected; two,
we benefited from cost timing; and three, we had expense favorability from items that can break either way in any
given quarter and in Q2, they pretty much all fell favorable.
On the performance front, Retail volumes were solid in the areas where we took price. Our Foodservice business
exceeded our expectations as we priced to offset input cost inflation and held our spending lower. And finally, our
organization did a fantastic job delivering strong supply chain productivity, being very mindful with discretionary
spending, and continuing to deliver on our cost efficiency programs.
Not all of the favorable items will repeat as I'll talk about in a few minutes, but I am very pleased with how our teams
are managing through this inflationary period, which we expect to continue at least through the remainder of the fiscal
year.
In addition to good P&L performance, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet to put to work to create
additional shareholder value.
Going to the numbers, our adjusted net sales in the quarter increased 2.1% on the 3.2% decrease in volume. Our sales
increase was driven by our Retail business. Our overall company sales growth was driven by pricing, which we took to
offset higher input costs and also by favorable mix in both segments.

Gross profit dollars and rates were down versus last year, primarily as a result of significantly higher input costs. For
the quarter, our adjusted gross profit rate was 30.5%. This is down from 31.4% last year when we experienced
significant commodity deflation.
Aside from the input cost, price, volume dynamic, our gross margin benefited from our productivity programs, supply
chain efficiencies and some expense timing favorability. The second quarter is also our seasonal high quarter, which
gives us leverage on our fixed cost base and helps our gross margins.
Our second quarter MAP investment was $33 million or just over 3% of net sales and down from last year's second
quarter. As we said before, our MAP rate will move from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, ranging
from innovation launch timing to competitive dynamics. So, this quarter's MAP level is lower than our average MAP
rate, reflecting a number of factors including our plans for a very strong second half MAP investment.
Our adjusted SG&A, excluding MAP, was down versus the second quarter of fiscal 2013 on tight cost management and
expense timing. Additionally, corporate costs were only $7 million for the quarter versus a more normal level of about
$15 million that we would expect. Lower corporate expense was the result of mark-to-market gains, lower spending,
and favorable expense items. Excluding significant items and mark-to-market gains or losses, we now expect to end the
year between $50 million and $55 million for corporate expenses.
Our adjusted EPS was up 6.5% for the second quarter, off of a very strong comparable in the second quarter of last year
when our adjusted EPS was up 29%. Year-to-date, you see that our adjusted EPS is down 8.2% on sales that are up
1.6%. The EPS decline is driven by a $31 million or 4.9% decline in adjusted gross profit as we did not fully recover
the significant commodity inflation we experienced.
As I said before, our goal is to fundamentally improve the profitability of our business from where we began. When
you compare our first half results with our fiscal 2012 baseline year as we do on this slide, you can see that we are
making progress. Our investments in brand building and innovation, which are fueled by our cost efficiency programs,
are clearly moving the centerline of our profitability up.
Now, let's take a look at the segments. Our Retail segment sales were up 2.7%. As you know, we took price this quarter
and we saw volumes hold better than we expected in some areas during the holiday season, so pricing mix offset our
lower volumes. The positive performance of our Jimmy Dean and Aidells businesses were somewhat offset by
continued softness in the challenged deli and bakery businesses.
Operating income was up 2.8% compared to an increase of 23% in the second quarter of last year. The Retail segment
is where the MAP timing plays out in the numbers, so in Retail, lower expenses in the quarter offset the lower gross
profit that resulted from higher input costs.
In our Foodservice/Other segment, second quarter sales grew 0.3%. Increased pricing and favorable mix offset a 6%
volume decline. The volume decline excluding commodity meat sales was 3.7% and was the result of a tough operating
environment and slow traffic in the restaurant channel. Excluding commodity meat sales, Foodservice net sales were up
0.7%.
Operating segment income increased 10.9%. The segment delivered an 11% operating segment margin, which is higher
than we expected. In some parts of Foodservice, we have contracts that enable us to pass-through pricing as input cost
rise. We did this, and so favorable price and mix offset higher commodity inflation, and the segment also benefited
from supply chain efficiencies and expense timing.
Similar to last year, though, we expect the second half operating segment margin for Foodservice/Other to be
significantly lower than the first half operating margin because of seasonal mix differences. And as we have said
before, the foodservice industry overall continues to be a tough space. And while we're outperforming the market and
taking share in some areas, we do continue to have modest expectations for this segment of our business.
Let me move on to cash. Our year-to-date adjusted cash flow was $38 million, including the cash paid for Golden
Island and $30 million of share repurchases. Our year-to-date EBITDA was 13.5% of net sales, and our leverage

remains low with $551 million of net debt. As of the end of the quarter, we had $397 million of cash and short-term
investments, and we are well positioned to execute the growth agenda that we've outlined.
Our capital allocation plan has not changed. Our first priority continues to be investing in the business. Our investments
in brand building, innovation, capability development and efficiency programs are targeted at creating long term,
sustainable growth and profitability, and to-date, we are very pleased with what we are seeing from those investments.
In the quarter, we repurchased $20 million of stock as part of our expectation of repurchasing $200 million through
fiscal 2015. And finally, we continue to pursue M&A opportunities to drive additional value.
So, based on where we are half way through the year, we are refining our fiscal 2014 guidance. We continue to expect
sales to increase slightly for the fiscal year. This outlook incorporates the expected benefit of increased MAP and
robust innovation launches mitigating the volume impact from broadened pricing actions.
We now expect EPS for fiscal 2014 to be near the high end of our previous range of flat to down mid-single digits. This
incorporates the sales estimate I just spoke about and our expectations that input cost inflation will continue to pressure
our gross margins in the second half. We now expect that our second half gross margin rate will be similar to the
average of the first half.
Additionally, we expect SG&A and corporate expenses to be higher than they were in the first half because of expense
timing and also our expectation that some of the favorability that we have experienced will not repeat.
Before I close, let me comment on taxes. You see in the tables in the back of the earnings release that we recorded a
significant tax benefit in our reported results. This relates primarily to the reversal of a state tax valuation allowance in
the quarter. There will be additional details in our 10-Q, which we plan to file later today. I will note, however, this
does not impact our adjusted tax rate, which we expect to be 35% to 36% for this year.
So, with that let me go ahead and turn it back to Sean.
Sean M. Connolly
Thanks Maria. I'll wrap up our prepared remarks with this. Clearly, I'm pleased with the quarter, but I'm most pleased
by the tangible progress our team has made to build a winner for the long haul. We've always had great brands. Now,
our improved capabilities are enabling us to unlock the potential of our portfolio, in particular, I'm proud of the clear
eyed and objective approach our team takes to their work. Whatever comes their way, whether it's a new opportunity to
drive sales growth or an inflation challenge that requires pricing and tightened spending, they don't blink. Rather, they
jump on it and they make it happen, and I'm confident that clarity and agility will serve us well for a long time to come.
With that, Operator, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A

Thank you [Operator Instructions] Thank you our first question comes from Ken Goldman. Your line is open and State
your Company please.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: JP Morgan. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Maria, couple questions. Can you quantify the input cost headwind you're seeing now versus
what you saw a quarter ago? And if you can provide some detail about what in particular has risen so much? I'm seeing,
at least, in the data that we have, sows up a little, beef trimming is up a lot, but pork trimmings, they really have been
flat or down slightly since you last reported. So, I'm curious, what you're seeing there? And then if you could update us

on your latest perspective on PEDV, because summer hog futures have risen sharply on those fears, but spot pork
prices really aren't that high? So, I know there's a lot of questions in there, I'm just hoping for some more color on
commodities.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure, Ken. Thanks for the question. I did see your report. I think a couple of things. I won't give a
specific number, but since last time we were on the phone with you guys in October, when we looked at the remainder
of our fiscal year, so not just the second quarter but the remainder of the fiscal year, our input costs have risen versus
what we expected. The areas that are rising continue to be in beef and in sow and the outlook on PEDV, that one is
tough. We watch very closely the number of new reported cases on that and while we're very hopeful that one of the
vaccines that are being developed as people try to combat this will work, that remains a variable for the second half of
the year. So, what I can tell you is input costs are up for the full fiscal year versus last time we were on the phone with
you and it's mostly in those two areas.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Are you basing that mostly on what you're seeing with the hog curve when you take your
guidance up or are there other things that you're looking at there? I know you mentioned beef and sows, but beef and
sows have gone up. They haven't gone up that much as far as I can tell to drive your numbers up significantly higher.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. There's a number of factors that affect our outlook, so we look at our specific commodity
basket, of course, and we look at all of our various hedging positions that we have through the year and we look at the
curves and where they are. So, given our specific commodity basket, our hedging position, what we see going on in the
market, particularly with some of the variability around sow. We are expecting additional inflation for the year.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: All right. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, Alexia Howard. Your line is open. And state your company name.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Yes. It's Sanford Bernstein. Can I ask about the pricing dynamics, particularly in the
sausage segment? It looks from the consumer takeaway data as though quite a lot of price was put through and the
volumes, at least, in the data that we're seeing were quite weak, but it sounds as though the volume numbers that you're
seeing may not be so bad. Could you talk a little bit about pricing and competitive dynamics in that segment? Thank
you.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Sure, Alexia. Overall, we are the market leader in many of our categories and that means
that we decide when we believe it's right to take price and in many cases we are leading the pricing actions and we did
that in quarter two. As we do that, we model in what we expect to be the elasticity response to that, because as we've
spoken on previous calls, we've made a ton of progress in that area in terms of that capability. But of course, elasticities
are dynamic and one of the reasons they are not dynamic is because we are working so hard to try to strengthen our
brands and reduce elasticities over time. So, you never get it exactly right, but you put your best model in there and
then you track it accordingly. So, I'd say, net-net, overall, for the quarter, we saw a more muted response than we
would have anticipated and I think that's a good sign on average for our brands.
In terms of where we are with Hillshire and the sausage category, we feel very good about it. If you look at the baseline
trends in that category in the last year since we've been kind of refreshing that smoked sausage business, we feel like its
performing very consistently with what we'd expect. In any given window of time, you may see a competitor in that
category get more promotional for a variety of reasons, that will be their rationale not ours. And we continue to run our
play. Obviously, in general, we monitor and we'll continue to monitor like a hawk what happens in terms of volume
trends vis-à-vis the pricing actions we take. But thus far, moving through Q2 and now into Q3, we feel good about
where we are. We've got more pricing coming, obviously, per our comments today and we'll continue to watch it, but
whether it's sausage or other categories, right now, I feel good about where we are.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

Thank you. Next question is Andrew Lazar. Your line is open. And state your company please.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Barclays. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Maria Henry>: Hi Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Sean, sounds like, as you just said, your elasticities are a bit better than you anticipated, even
though you've been leading the pricing in lot of areas. So, even though I know you're broadening pricing from here, I
would think that as others maybe start to catch up on pricing in some areas where you had led maybe over the last
quarter or two, is more reason to think that maybe the elasticity stays a bit more muted potentially going forward?
And then it's only a quarter, but how much of this do you think is because you've strengthened the brands in a different
way than maybe the last time, you had to take a lot of pricing which was a bit tougher on volume versus I don't know,
the competitors following the pricing more quickly this time than last time? I'm trying to get a sense of how much of
that is structural versus not.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I think the first part of my answer here has got to be that we are much farther along in
terms of our brand positioning, our product innovations, our packaging than we were a couple of years ago. We've
made a ton of progress there and there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that that drives brand loyalty and our numbers
have been improving in that regard. By the same token, in the food business you got to remain somewhat humble. Your
work is never done. It's a competitive space. The consumer is stressed right now. So, I think there is some underlying
improvement in elasticities and what we've seen, but we also compete in very competitive categories and it's not out of
the realm of possibility that we'll see competitors go for a volume grab here and behave less rationally than we've seen
in the recent months.
So, we have to reserve some flexibility to respond and we also have to be pragmatic about how much better our
elasticity is. I made a comment that is a bit of our judgment at this point around Q2 elasticities and how we think they
were more muted than what we'd expect in the back half. Part of that is judgment. That's more of the art of figuring this
out and what we're talking about there is when you're buying Jimmy Dean roll sausage to go into your Thanksgiving
stuffing, our conclusion is you're probably less likely to roll the dice and trade down to a lower price product than if it's
just a random Saturday morning sausage consumption in March. So, that's where we are not precise in our modeling
and that's more of our experience and our judgment driving that outlook, but we think there's absolute legitimacy to it.
But overall, I think structurally, we're in a much better place and frankly, no matter what happens from here out, we're
going to continue to work and plan this way because we believe this is absolutely the right way to run the railroad.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks for that. And then with sales being expected to be up, I think, you said slightly for the
full year – obviously, more pricing rather than volume, where do you think -- it's still a guess here, but where would
volume come in on the full year? In other words, you'll have some elasticity, of course, as you broaden out pricing, but
you'll be shipping in and trying to kind of make up for some of that, as you said in the prepared remarks, with a lot of
the new items that you're really coming out within a bigger way in the back half of the year. Would you still expect
volumes to be lower year-over-year by a bit or is that likely to be somewhat positive given the new products as well?
<A - Maria Henry>: Yeah, Andrew, we're still expecting volumes to be lower on a year-over-year basis in the second
half.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it. Thanks very much.

<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: BMO Capital Markets. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: After you take the pricing actions, what percentage of your portfolio that has the higher
input costs will be covered by the pricing actions?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, we don't get into specifics, Ken, on our pricing plans in terms of how broadly are we
going to take them, because that kind of tips our hands in what is a very competitive environment, but in general, our
principal on pricing is that we expect to fully recover the inflation we face with pricing over time. And the way it
works, and the way it's always worked for us is pretty straightforward, where in the deflationary times like last year,
earnings tend to get a boost because we don't pass-through a 100% of the cost relief, but inflationary times earnings
tend to be pressured because we don't fully recover 100% of the cost increase in any given year. That said, we aim to
cover as much of it as we possibly can, which means, if the input cost inflation is broad-based then we will look to
make our pricing similarly broad-based.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Let's take an environment and say, 6 months to 12 months where PD virus becomes less of
an issue and the current sow price which is actually, I think, about 12% below where you had last quarter, if inflation
does actually come down, would you actually have to reverse your price actions and how much margin expansion
would you seem to expect to get?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: The way we've talked about that historically really remains true, which is, by and large, we
are not a pass-through business like that. The one exception to the rule tends to be our Foodservice segment, where we
do have contracts with customers, which pass through pricing when we see inflation rather quickly, but it also works
the other way around. On the Retail side of our business, I think our game plan right now in the eyes of our customers
would be characterized as heavily focused on innovation, and our customers are extremely pleased with that approach
from Hillshire because they are looking for innovation to stimulate their categories, and they want us to have the fuel
for that growth. So, they'd much rather see us put the emphasis into a continued stream of innovation – we call it a
funnel and not a tunnel, so it's a continuous stream of innovation as opposed to having a surge of innovation and then
falling flat-footed for a year.
So, on average, we'll look to hold on to the pricing we've taken in the Retail segment and put our energy and our
spending into innovation so we can continue to make our customers pleased with Hillshire as an innovator. Clearly, that
is category specific. And we will have competitors in certain categories that look to boost volumes and market share
should we come out of an inflationary period, go into a deflationary period. And as we've said before, if that happens,
we will defend the market-leading positions that we've built so carefully with vigor, but we'll be very rational about it.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Okay. My final question is on cash deployment. I think you've been quoted in some news
sources and saying that you would like very much to get an acquisition done. I thought it was by year-end and I'm not
sure if it meant fiscal year-end or not, but it seems like maybe the deployment of cash towards acquisition is a little bit
slower than you anticipated. Can you talk about what the acquisition environment is for you, has something changed at
all, are the prices too high? How do you think about it?
<A - Maria Henry>: Ken, I'll take that one. The acquisition environment remains very good. We're very positive on
what we're seeing in the market. We're seeing a lot of attractive opportunities for us of various sizes. As you know,
with M&A, we can't exactly predict the timing, but we absolutely do intend to be an acquirer. If you think about what
we've done on capital allocation overall, I think we've been very consistent. Our first priority is investing in the
business. We took our dividend up coming into this year. We announced that we intend to do $200 million of share
repurchases over two years through fiscal 2015. And so, we've got a very attractive balance sheet that gives us a lot of
flexibility and access to the debt market to react very quickly when we do have an opportunity to move on some M&A
activity, where we see things that we can bring into our portfolio to help advance our growth agenda, our margin
expansion agenda, as well as reduce the overall volatility of our portfolio over the long-term. So, nothing to update you
on today and it's hard to predict the timing, but we are actively looking at opportunities. We see a lot of good things and
happy that we have the flexibility to be in a position to move quickly when something is actionable.

<A - Sean M. Connolly>: If I could also build on Maria's comments here, the Aidells acquisition we made a couple
years ago continues to be a homerun for us. That is going exceptionally well. And more recently -- much more recently
we had the Golden Island acquisition, which while small, is very exciting in terms of really giving us an entry into a
very interesting category and that integration has gone absolutely seamlessly as well. So, we are quite active right now,
seeing what's actionable out there and also evaluating what makes sense economically and strategically. Our goal is not
to stockpile cash, but we do need to allow our highly disciplined approach to M&A to play out and we're rather bullish
about it.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Right. I appreciate. Thank you.

Thank you. Next question, Akshay Jagdale. Your line is open. And state your company please.
<Q - Lubi John Kutua>: Hi. This is actually Lubi on for Akshay from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Good morning.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning.
<Q - Lubi John Kutua>: I just wanted to follow-up on the earlier questions about the commodity inflation if I may.
Just could you tell us how much it was in this quarter and maybe in the first half so far? And then if you could give us
some sort of order of magnitude of how much your expectations have changed now versus where your previous
estimates were that would be helpful?
<A - Maria Henry>: Yeah. I'll take that one. In terms of the commodities, we don't give specific numbers, but if you
go back to looking at what we expected when we built our plan and gave our guidance in the beginning of this fiscal
year, and when you look at what our expectation is today in terms of commodity inflation, it is significantly higher.
And as I mentioned a few moments ago, when I look at what we thought for the remainder of the fiscal year back when
we were on the phone with you in October versus what we think today, those estimates are also higher. So, given our
basket, given our strategy on hedging, we've seen a tremendous amount of commodity inflation both on a
year-over-year basis and versus our expectation.
So, the fact that we are able to still be within the guidance range and near the high end of the guidance range on the
profitability despite the fact that we've had significant commodity inflation beyond our expectations, I think, is a good
result and an indicator that our business model is working and that the team is doing good job managing on the expense
side and being able to get in front of things and react very quickly, both in terms of pricing and in terms of cost
management, but it is significantly higher than we thought when we entered the fiscal year.
<Q - Lubi John Kutua>: Okay. Thank you. And then just in terms of the lunchmeat category, could you give us a
little bit more color on sort of what your expectations are for that business going forward? And I know you mentioned
in your opening remarks that the business has rebounded nicely and you talked a little bit about shifting marketing mix,
but just how should we think about that category going forward?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: The way you should think about the category is that it is an important business for our
company. Remember, when we started this journey, nothing had been done with that business in quite some time, so
we put a lot of effort into getting the fundamentals right, getting the product quality right, trying to update the
packaging, get some new line extensions in play and then turn on advertising. And as you saw in the deck today, it was
working nicely and we grew sales -- grew volumes last year, 6% in the second quarter and then we had a packaging
challenge in the back half of last year. The core business has rebounded nicely, but we have, obviously, bigger plans
than just to continue to nurture and be stewards of the core business and a lot of that is really around innovation. So,
what I can tell you at this point is that we'll have more exciting innovation on lunchmeat and we will have more to
share with you down in Florida in a few weeks at the CAGNY Conference.
<Q - Lubi John Kutua>: Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.

Thank you. Next question, John Baumgartner. Your line is open. And state your company.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Wells Fargo. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Sean, looking at Foodservice here,
pretty significant volume decline and I guess particularly versus last quarter and I guess in light of some of these new
products launching as well. Can you just go into that decline in a little bit more detail in terms of how temporary or not
temporary you're thinking that it's going to be?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I think you've got a lot going on in the Foodservice division right now. First of all,
you've got a sector that continues to be in, what I called last quarter, cyclical malaise, and that hasn't changed. And you
heard in Maria's comments today that traffic through the holiday season through the second quarter in the channel was
weak and that's certainly a contributor to it. But the Foodservice division is also not immune to elasticity effects and we
plan those in. So, overall, I'd say the business is, on the sales line, not too far off of what we would expect there and the
team has done an exceptionally good job with cost management, recognizing that, hey, in times of adversity,
everybody's got to up their game and make sure that we create as much flex as we can. So, I'd say, that business is
about where we'd expect it to be given the macro environment. And then I think as Maria points out, just the reminder
too on Foodservice that the margin structure in that business varies by season and we hit a seasonal high in Q2. And
what we expect in the balance of the year is much more consistent relative to the second quarter and the first half with
the changes we saw last year.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Then I guess in terms of the menu offerings and the growth in desserts, did you see any
indications yet that consumers are opening their wallets more for dessert or is it more just distribution gains that you're
getting in your pies business right now?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well it's a bit – there are some core strengths there because we have been innovating and we
always talk about innovation in context of the Retail division, but Foodservice team has been phenomenal in terms of
the innovation they've brought in the marketplace. They are doing that because they are trying to gain share. And
frankly, they have been gaining share. They've been gaining quite a bit of share in key categories like pies. This year
we had a big innovation on double stuffed-layer pie, it's the only one of its kind in the world and it's pretty provocative
stuff and it does help us gain share. But when you're gaining share in a shrinking market, you don't pick up a lot of
ground and that is the reason why our outlook for that segment remains modest for the months ahead.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Okay. Thanks, Sean.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: All right. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Next question Robert Moskow. Your line is open. And state your company please.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi. Credit Suisse. Sean, I'm just trying to step back and think about what you've learned
about the business over the last year and a half or so and one of the major assumptions that you had when you had the
operating plan was that sales could grow or the pace of growth could get up to 4% to 5% at some point and then also
that your MAP spending could accelerate rapidly to – what was it, 5% of sales. And what I've seen over the last 18
months is that the company's done very well, you've made a lot of good improvements within the organization, but the
sales growth seems to be very dependent on pricing and the MAP spending also seems to be dependent on what's going
on in the competitive environment and how much merchandising is necessary. I just wanted to know if have you had to
adjust any of those assumptions about how the business works? And if you have, how does it alter at all your outlook
for EPS power?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Sure. Well, first of all, our outlook, our midterm outlook is not changing at all and our plan
remains intact. Our philosophy here has been and continues to be the same, which is we're focused on brand building
and building the business for sustained long-term value creation, and our approach to innovation and MAP we believe

is exactly the right approach. And as you remember, when we got into this we said look, this is going to build. This is
not going to be like flipping a switch. We've got a portfolio here that we believe has been under managed and has been
neglected and we've got some fundamentals that we've got to work on to put the business in a position to perform.
And since the day we launched we've had two significant and unusual events in the last couple of years. One was the
drought and this year's PEDV. We clearly don't expect those kinds of events to be emerging every single year. So, I
would say, we are very pleased with the progress we have made against strengthening the core portfolio, especially
given the unique dynamics that we've encountered in the marketplace in the last couple of years. So, I feel very good
about it. And the one piece I always remind folks when we talk about growing at, at least, 4% with this portfolio is,
we're a $4 billion company, so when we're growing 4% in absolute dollars that puts our floor at growing $160 million a
year, which with the portfolio of brands we've got and the slate of innovations we've got, we think is absolutely
achievable. I think that number feels a lot bigger than it is for a company like ours and when you apply it to a $20
billion company, that's enormous pressure of growing that amount year-in year-out. But I think it's absolutely doable
for us and I think the progress we are making with the underlying structural strength of the brand amid some adversity
is indicative of that.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: And do you have a MAP target for this year? I know you're going to spend more in the
back half, but what is your target for the year?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Let me give you my perspective on MAP. I'm glad you asked that. We don't give MAP
guidance on an annual basis. What we have said is that by the end of fiscal 2015, we want MAP rates to be at about
5%. But we've also said that will move around from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons, and frankly, there may
be variability year to year depending upon the environment. The key is, overall, around MAP is, we're committed to it
and we're committed to it because it works. If you look at Q2, our MAP support level in Q2 was very meaningful. Our
GRPs were up in the high single-digits and the dollar spend was down for a few reasons and that may happen from
quarter-to-quarter periodically.
Let me give you the color on Q2 MAP. Three things in Q2 that caused the dollars to be down. First, as I mentioned last
quarter, on Hillshire Farm lunchmeat, especially at the beginning of quarter two, we still had a bunch of our marketing
money shifting above the line to trade, where last year it was below the line in MAP and that was intentional and that
was to help us recapture some of the lapsed consumers on Hillshire Farm lunchmeat and it was exceedingly effective.
So, we feel very good about that. Another piece of the MAP was pushed out of what was in the second quarter year ago
into the second half this year and the reason we did that was very pragmatic and that's we've got a huge innovation slate
coming in the second half of the year and we want to align our MAP spend with that innovation slate.
And the third piece of it is not inconsequential and you've been hearing a bit of this in the industry in general and I
would say, we're as good at it now as probably anybody out there. But as you saw last quarter, we have made huge
strides in getting more bang for our buck with MAP efficiency. So, we were in a position this year and this quarter is a
good example, where our GRPs were up 7%, which is not small on a significantly lower spend. That is an area that the
team has really continued to surprise us on the positive side and I think what it reflects is that MAP hadn't really been
scrubbed and optimized in quite some time, so there is more efficiency there than we probably originally expected.
But at this point our overall target of 5% by next year, that still is as good as anything. And what I want to also remind
our investors is that we invest our MAP on a very select number of brands. It's very focused on the few brands that
have demonstrated empirical evidence that the MAP generates a return. So, the way we talk about internally is, we
spend MAP on brands when they're MAP-ready, and over time, we expect more of our branded portfolio to become
MAP-ready. But until we get there, we're going to spend it in a very disciplined way because ultimately, we've got to
grow profit of this business so it's got to be good ROI. Hope that's helpful.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Well, I'd have asked for more detail, but I don't think that's possible. So, thank you.

Thank you [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Next question, Jason English. Your line is open. And state your
company please.
<Q - Varun S. Gokarn>: Hi. It's actually Varun Gokarn in for Jason. It's Goldman Sachs. One question on gross
margin. You mentioned that it was going to be roughly in line with the first half for the second half. You got some
good supply chain productivity in the first half. There was some expense timing benefits in the second quarter and then
you're seeing the level of inflation is supposed to be higher in the second half. So, given those headwinds, why would
you expect them to be flat with the first half of the year and what are the other drivers that are going to allow you to
achieve that?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. Let me take that one. The commentary around the gross profit rate in the second half is
driven by a couple of things. We had previously said that we expected our gross margins to increase as the year
progressed. So, given the changes in what we see in front of us, particularly on the input cost side, we wanted to make
sure that we gave an updated perspective on that. So, we've got higher input costs than we had expected. And the other
variable is really watching to see what happens to volumes as we have broadened pricing out into the market and to
watch the consumer reaction to the actions that we were taking. So, when we look at all of those dynamics, we think
that where we'll end is somewhere around equivalent to what we were able to put up for the first half.
<Q - Varun S. Gokarn>: Okay. Great. And then one just quick question on MAP spend. I know you talked about this
[indiscernible] (47:58) Sean, but in terms of the back half of the year, is it conceivable you have MAP spending up
year-on-year at any point, especially given the timing between the second and the third quarter?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: I can't give you a specific number, because I don't want to set a precedent for guiding MAP,
especially I don't do it by year, I'm not going to do it by half or by quarter, but I can tell you that our plan is not only to
have a robust MAP spend in the back half of the year, but it is also now to have a higher level of MAP spend in the
back half of the year than we expected a quarter ago. And the reason we're doing that is kind of similar to where we
were last year which when we said, look we're at the midway point of our year and we're ahead of what we expected.
We're going to take some of that over delivery to the bottom line. We are going to take some of that over delivery and
invest back in the business. We were doing it for different reasons last year, but the philosophy remains the same.
We're doing it this year into an inflationary environment, into an environment where there's more pricing, but again, it's
all about long-term sustainable performance. The more we can invest in these brands, particularly in times of
challenging macro environment, the stronger they're going to be over time, the lower the elasticities will be and the
higher the margins will be and that's what we're going to continue to do.
<Q - Varun S. Gokarn>: Okay. Great. Thanks guys. I'll pass it on.
