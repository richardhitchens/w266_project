MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Q2 2012 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kim and I will be your operator for
today's call. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this
conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations
and Communications. Ms. DeSanctis, you may begin.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thank you, Kim, and good morning to everybody. Again, thank you for joining us on this ConocoPhillips Second
Quarter Earnings Call. I'm in the room today with Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Sheets, our EVP and
Chief Financial Officer. And before I turn the conference over to those two gentlemen, let me make a few
administrative comments.
First of all, you'll notice we've provided a lot of new information with today's disclosure and, of course, that's to help
you understand the business better. We've provided segment data on each of our regions, in addition to some data on
our Corporate segment and I just want to let people know, Vladimir and I will be available after the call to help you sort
through those details as needed.
In addition, I want to remind you that our presentation materials, for the call today, can be found on our website and a
transcript of this call will be posted, again, to our website, hopefully by no later than tomorrow morning. And then
finally, if you'll advance to Slide 2, you'll note our cautionary statement. We will make some forward-looking
statements during today's webcast and actual results could differ materially from the expectations we share today. The
factors that could cause these results to differ are listed in this cautionary statement as well as in our periodic filings

with the SEC.
And now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ryan Lance.
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Ellen, and thank you all for joining the call today. As I reflect back and in mid-April, we laid out our plans
for the newly independent ConocoPhillips and today represents our first quarterly call to update you on those plans. So
I'm looking forward to your questions at the end as well.
So I'll begin my comments on Slide 3 and cover some of our key second quarter highlights. Strategically, the second
quarter was certainly an eventful one. Less than 100 days ago, we completed the spin-off of our Phillips 66 Company.
And while we were prepared for the event, it's really hard to know until that event actually shows up how things go.
But I'm pleased to say that I think we hit the ground running and I certainly couldn't be prouder of our employees. They
certainly stepped up in a pretty big way.
So in addition to completing the Phillips 66 spin off, we continued to make progress on our divestiture program. This
was a strategic program that's important for completing the repositioning of the ConocoPhillips and adding financial
flexibility to the company. In the quarter, we generated about $500 million of proceeds from asset sales in the North
Sea and we continue to advance our progress on other assets. We still estimate that our announced program will be
complete by mid-2013. I also include a point about our unconventional and our conventional exploration program as a
strategic highlight. We made progress in the quarter on these important activities with more to come in the year. And
I'll speak about our exploration activities in more detail in a moment because this is an important part of our plans for
the future and we have a lot going on in this area.
Operationally, the business ran well in the quarter. We achieved the high end of our estimated production range for the
quarter at 1.54 million barrels equivalent per day. Key production highlights include our ongoing strong performance
from unconventional assets in the Lower 48 led by our Eagle Ford development and from our oil sands in Canada. Our
major projects have progressed, notably our APLNG. And in the second quarter, we advanced that Train 2 towards FID
and recently announced that milestone. Both Jeff and I will cover some additional details about our operational
performance in later comments.
Moving to the financial themes, clearly our strong operational quarter was overshadowed by weaker commodity prices.
This translated to lower income and cash flow for the quarter compared to prior periods. It's important to note that our
diversified portfolio helped buffer some of the impact of weaker North American commodity prices. This allowed us to
generate $1.5 billion of adjusted earnings, or $1.22 of adjusted earnings per share. Excluding working capital, we
achieved $3 billion in cash from operations. What's important to note is that this cash flow number reflects the fact that
we had a number of high margin production, offline, due to planned turnarounds this quarter. In other words, the $3
billion should not be considered ratable. And finally, we purchased $3.1 billion of ConocoPhillips shares in the quarter,
representing a total of about 52 million shares. And through six months, we've delivered on our goal of repurchasing $5
billion worth of shares.
So in summary, we had a strong quarter, strategically and operationally, delivering on several important fronts. While
commodity prices softened, we stayed focused and delivered on things we can control to meet our commitment for
growth, financial returns and yield over the long-term.
So if you turn to Slide 4, I'd like to address the state of the business and put some perspective around the focus areas
and the priorities for the rest of the year and beyond. As I already mentioned, the business is running well and that's
absolutely key. We are focused on delivering our programs and plans, safely, on time, and on budget. Our major
growth projects are on track and these include our Lower 48 unconventional resource plays as well as our major growth
projects in the Canadian oil sands, the North Sea projects in the U.K. and Norway, APLNG and our Malaysian
deepwater projects. These are the major projects that will underpin our long-term goal to deliver 3% to 5% with margin
expansion at flat prices.

Aside from the major projects, the base business is also running well. As you know, second and third quarters are
typically high season for maintenance down time. So we have those activities well in hand. Finally, we continue to
starve dry gas drilling and divert capital to the liquid rich plays.
As I mentioned a minute ago, our exploration program continues to gain momentum. This is an aspect of the business
that we are reemphasizing in the new ConocoPhillips. And I'd like to give you some highlights of that. First, I should
note that when I talk about exploration, I talk about it through two lenses, a conventional lens and unconventional lens.
And we have a lot of activity in both our unconventional and conventional programs throughout the year and in this
second quarter. In the unconventional plays, we continue to test liquid rich opportunities in North America. We have
pilot programs actively underway in plays like the Niobrara, the Wolfcamp, the Duvernay and the Avalon.
We are also evaluating several other opportunities, some of which are associated with ConocoPhillips' massive land
position in the Lower 48 and Western Canada. With approximately 21 million net acres, much of it held by production,
we have access to some potentially impactful, unconventional plays. One example that I'd like to share with you this
morning is the Mancos Shale in the San Juan Basin. We are the largest leaseholder in the San Juan Basin today with
900,000 acres held by production. We have been actively reviewing our extensive data across the Mancos in the gas,
the liquids rich and the oil window and plan to test the play later in the year.
Other companies are actively testing the play now, which means we're effectively de-risking the play with other
people's money. If the play is successful, we have years and years of drilling activity ahead. It's opportunities like these,
in our backyard, adjacent to where we have operating infrastructure and experience in already held by production, they
are what create long-term running room for the company in this unconventional space.
Internationally, we're currently getting ready to pilot test our 11 million acre unconventional shale position in
Australia's Canning Basin.
Now let me move to the conventional side. We've made significant progress here this quarter as well. During the
quarter, we spud three non-operated wells in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. An appraisal well was spud on the
Shenandoah prospect and two wildcat wells were started at the Bioko and Coronado prospects. We continue to build
our deepwater prospect inventory in the Gulf of Mexico, largely focused on the Paleogene play. We added a significant
chunk of acreage late last year and as well, we now hold more than 325 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. Finally, earlier
this year, we added significant conventional acreage positions in Angola and in Bangladesh and we're undertaking
seismic activities in both those areas right now. So we're busy in the exploration area and we think this is an important
part of the business where we are very effectively positioning for future growth and taking advantage of good
opportunities as they arise. This combined with our 43 billion barrel resource base is providing optionality to our
growth.
On the business development side, we're very focused on completing our announced asset sale program. We have
targeted selling $8 billion to $10 billion of assets by mid-2013. We have several packages on the market today. When
we started this divestiture program we understood some of the assets would take some time to sell but overall I'm pretty
pleased with the progress that we're making. This year-to-date, we've sold about $1.6 billion of assets with several more
currently in the process. We're being patient, but we remain committed to getting the program completed but we'll do
that at acceptable prices.
With the year half over, and the spin off complete, we have scrubbed our capital outlook for 2012. We now believe we
have good visibility on the rest of the year and estimate 2012 capital spending to about be $16 billion. This includes the
impact of pushing out the expected timing of asset sales, some of which have quite a lot of capital spending associated
with them.
It also includes the impact of some incremental exploration spending I just mentioned, as well as some incremental
investments for infrastructure in the Eagle Ford area to ensure that we're not constrained in that development. Although
commodity prices have weakened for all of industry, we continue to believe that our growth projects are robust enough
to justify our planned investment at a range of prices. These are projects that will generate growth, margin
improvement and returns for the longer term. For this reason, we do not think it's prudent to reduce our capital at this

time given that we're investing for long-term value creation. So some of the questions we get, I hope this next slide
starts to address and it looks at our funding sources and the uses issues in a bit more detail.
So this slide lays out our current thinking on our investment priorities and the actions we'll take to fund our growth
programs and maintain financial flexibility over the course of 2012 and 2013. It summarizes our sources of cash on the
left and our uses of cash, by priority, on the right. On the sources side, we have cash on hand of roughly $6 billion
today, plus incoming cash from operations. And of course, cash from operations will vary according to price but we
expect to generate cash proceeds from asset sales of between $8 billion and $10 billion over the course of the next year
and we have balance sheet capacity if needed.
At consensus views of cash from operations, the sum of this column for 2012 and 2013 combined could be as much as
$40 billion without going to the balance sheet.
On the right-hand side of this chart, we have the uses for the cash listed by priority. Our top priority for spending is to
fund our dividend. We believe that a company our size should distribute about 20% to 25% of our annual cash flows,
through the cycles, back to our shareholders. Our next priority is to fund our capital program at roughly $15 billion
annual level. Over the next two years, the sum of our expected dividends and annual capital program is roughly $36
billion.
So in the current environment, we have sufficient sources from cash, cash flows, and asset sales to cover our highest
priority uses, funding our dividend and investing in our capital programs and modestly reducing our debt levels. We
think this allocation makes sense and creates long-term value for our shareholders. Higher levels of asset sale proceeds
or higher cash from improved commodity prices would give us the opportunity to consider additional share
repurchases. On the other hand, if prices were to cycle down for an extended period of time, we would adjust our
capital program and use the balance sheet capacity if needed.
So now, let me turn over the call to Jeff and he'll cover our financial and our segment reviews.
Jeff W. Sheets
Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. I thought I would start this portion of the call with a list of some of the
key drivers that underpinned our financial and operating performance for the quarter. These are drivers that either
affected our segments across the board or represent some noteworthy impact to our financials. The first is no surprise.
North American crude, bitumen and natural gas and NGL prices continue to trend lower and we'll have more detail on
that on the next slide.
In terms of production, our volumes came in as planned with solid performance across our portfolio. Ryan stepped
through a few of these, but as a reminder, our Lower 48 shale and Canadian oil sands achieved production increases
which were somewhat offset by unusually heavy planned maintenance efforts and the impact of dispositions.
Generally, operating costs were as expected and dispositions also had some impact on our financials and we'll cover
that as we go through the segments.
I'd also note that the format of the slides we're using this morning are quite different from our previous earnings calls
with a lot more information being presented about each of our geographic operating segments. What's also different is
that we'll be providing outlook information as we go through the presentation instead of all at once at the end of the
presentation as we have done in previous earnings calls.
So if you move to Slide 7, we'll start the discussion with a discussion of our realized prices. About 55% of our
production consists of liquids and about 45% consists of natural gas. Of the 55% that's liquids, about 30% is tied to
Brent or international prices which were strong early in the quarter and began to decline later in the quarter. The
remaining 20% of liquids is tied to North American crude markers, NGL or bitumen prices, and this production
continues to be adversely impacted by wide crude differentials.

On the natural gas side, about 45% of our portfolio, roughly 20% consists of international gas, that's gas outside of
North America, or LNG which actually enjoyed relatively strong pricing this quarter. And the remainder of gas consists
of North American natural gas which of course continues to be challenged.
On the right side of this chart, we have presented the second quarter price realizations compared to prior periods. This
highlights the commodities that were weaker versus stronger in those periods, and our overall price declined about $6
from a year ago and about $5 from the first quarter. The key take-away from this slide is that we benefit somewhat
from a diversified global portfolio. About 55% of our mix was not affected by weaker North America pricing. As our
major projects come on line, our production mix shifts more to liquids and international gas, and this will help improve
our margin and cash flow growth in the future.
So let's move to Slide 8 and talk about total company production. As Ryan mentioned, our production was 1.54 million
BOE per day, on target with our expectations. This was down 97,000 BOE per day from the same period last year. At a
high level, you can see that this decrease can be bucketed roughly a third to dispositions, Vietnam, Statfjord and Alba,
about a third to downtime in Australia, Alaska and Canadian oil sands, and about a third to natural gas declines in
North America, driven by decreased activities and curtailments. However, what is also shown is that our growth offset
base declines, accounting for over 110,000 BOE per day compared to last year; the bulk of the growth coming from the
Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian and oil sands assets.
In a moment, I'll provide more detail on production by segment. Let me first give to you some guidance for production
estimates for the rest of the year. We expect third quarter production to be between 1.475 million BOE and 1.525
million BOE per day. Most of the expected drop from the second quarter to the third quarter is due to planned down
time in Alaska and the U.K. Our full year production estimate is now expected to be between 1.565 million BOE and
1.585 million BOE per day, and this includes the impact of dispositions.
Now I'll turn to our adjusted earnings on Slide 9. This slide shows the seven new reporting segments for our company.
We'll go through detail in each of these segments in subsequent slides, and there's also additional information along
with historical data in the supplemental tables included in the press release. Although we operated well, our results
compared to prior quarters were adversely impacted by the combination of lower commodity prices and lower
production as we discussed on the previous slides. Lower 48 and Canada were affected by natural gas prices that were
down more than 50%, NGL prices down more than 20% and Canadian bitumen prices down more than 20%. The
biggest volume-related impacts to earnings were the asset dispositions in Europe, lower production in China and the
turnaround in Australia.
Our second quarter adjusted earnings were $1.535 billion versus $2.31 billion a year ago. Now I'll turn to the segment
slides, beginning with Alaska on Slide 10. Our legacy asset in Alaska continues to operate well and provide strong
earnings and production performance. Production was 215,000 BOE per day, down from a year ago. The lower
production was driven by natural gas field decline, partially offset by improved drilling performance and lower
unplanned downtime. In the quarter, we completed a major turnaround at Kuparuk on schedule and on budget.
Adjusted net income for the segment was $551 million, roughly equivalent to a year ago.
In the third quarter, we have additional turnarounds planned, which we estimate will lower sequential production by
40,000 BOE to 50,000 BOE per day. Looking forward, Alaska's segment, where we have opportunities to mitigate
decline from incremental exploitation opportunities and we retain the option for some longer-term projects such as
LNG export and ANS gas. However, future developments from Alaska are contingent upon some improved fiscal
terms. So next, we'll move to the Lower 48 and Latin America segment, which is on Slide 11.
In this segment, we continue to advance several high margin growth projects across our asset base. Total production for
the quarter was 441,000 BOE per day, approximately 16,000 BOE per day higher than last year. The growth over last
year was driven by our liquids rich plays in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian. And this growth was partially offset
by natural gas declines across the portfolio. Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian average production in the second quarter
this year was 61,000 BOE, 25,000 BOE and 51,000 BOE per day respectively. Our total production of 137,000 BOE
per day from these three plays was 54,000 BOE per day higher than a year ago.

So looking more broadly across the Lower 48 portfolio, liquids production was up 24% and natural gas production
declined 8%. This reflects our shift in capital to liquids plays and away from dry gas drilling. Although we saw
year-over-year production growth in the Lower 48, the net income results from the second quarter were lower due to a
50% drop in natural gas prices and a 23% drop in NGL prices. This reduced net income $119 million for this segment.
In the second quarter, we had a total of 31 drilling rigs, comprised of 17 in the Eagle Ford, eight in the Bakken and six
in the Permian. And we expect to maintain a total of 27 rigs through the end of this year. The majority of the acreage in
the Bakken and the Permian is held by production and we expect to have the Eagle Ford acreage held by mid-2013.
Based on the positive results we're seeing to date on these liquid rich shale plays, we expect that we've identified
extensive development potential over the next several years. As Ryan mentioned earlier, we are resuming high impact
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration and appraisal activities. We would expect to have some results by late this year
or early next year.
So next we'll move to our Canadian segment on Slide 12. Canadian production was 268,000 BOE per day in the second
quarter, up 6,000 BOE per day versus the same period last year, driven by a ramp up in oil sands production. New
production growth of 22,000 BOE per day was offset by natural gas asset dispositions, natural gas curtailments and
lower well performance, as a result of restricted capital investments in our natural gas fields. As you can see on the
production chart, liquids as a proportion of our total segment production increased compared to last year. Liquids
volumes were up year-over-year 19%, while natural gas declined 9%. Again, like the Lower 48 segment, the shift
should start to show up as improved margins over time.
So even though our Canadian business operated well, segment earnings reflected significantly lower bitumen prices,
increased WTI, WCS spreads and lower natural gas and NGL prices. As a result of these factors and given that 63% of
our total production in Canada is attributable to natural gas and NGLs, adjusted net income was a negative $94 million
for the quarter compared to a positive $82 million in the second quarter of 2011. It's important to note that this segment
has generated positive operating cash flow year-to-date. So even with gas prices at recent lows, the cash flows from this
segment are important sources of cash for redeploying into our growth programs.
The company's oil sands projects continue to perform well with production growth from Christina Lake Phase C and
Surmont Phase I. This resulted in an increased bitumen production of 20,000 BOE per day compared to the second
quarter of 2011. Additionally, the Surmont Phase II development and further FCCL expansion phases are underway
and should lead to further production growth over the next several years.
In May, we received approval from the Alberta government to proceed with the Narrows Lake oil sands project and the
project is anticipated to have gross production capacity of 130,000 BOE per day to be developed in three phases
starting in 2017.
So next, we'll move to the Europe segment on Slide 13. Second quarter production in Europe decreased by 42,000 BOE
per day to 236,000 BOE per day. This was primarily driven by a natural gas field decline in – by natural field decline in
Britannia, Ekofisk and J-Block, downtime and the Statfjord and the Alba asset dispositions. Net income in Europe was
$414 million, down $119 million from last year. Commodity prices held up in this segment relatively well compared to
the North American market and positive FX impacts slightly improved income this quarter. In the near term, we expect
volumes in this segment to decline. Volumes will begin to increase when the Jasmine project comes online in 2013 and
when additional North Sea projects, the Clair, Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II startup. And one additional point I'll remind
you is that the U.K. recently enacted legislation which restricts corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs to the
50% tax rate, retroactive back to March of 2012. And we anticipate that in the third quarter 2012 that our earnings will
be reduced by approximately $175 million due to remeasurement of these deferred tax liabilities.
So I'll turn to Slide 14 and talk about our Asia Pacific and Middle East segments. Production in this segment was
270,000 BOE per day, down approximately 85,000 BOE per day from the second quarter of 2011. This reduction was
driven by the curtailment of the Peng Lai production, the disposition of Vietnam business unit and by the safe
completion of a 41-day turnaround at the Darwin LNG project. At the end of the second quarter, Peng Lai was
producing 30,000 BOE per day, net. We are seeking approval for our final operating and development plan, but
continue to ramp up production under an interim production resumption plan.

Compared to the same period last year, adjusted net income decreased by $167 million to $789 million. This decrease
was driven by 24% lower volumes, slightly offset by improved LNG prices and lower DD&A. The second production
train at APLNG was sanctioned in July and project financing agreements were signed during the second quarter. The
project is on track for first deliveries of LNG in 2015. Concurrent with project sanctions, ConocoPhillips further
reduced its working interest in the project to 37.5%. In Malaysia, development continues on several projects including
the deepwater Gumusut oil field off the coast of Sabah, the natural gas Kebabangan Field and the oil fields at Malikai
and Siakap North-Petai. Finally, we anticipate beginning our pilot program in the Canning Basin, that Ryan mentioned,
in the third quarter.
So I'll move to our International segment on Slide 15. This segment includes our assets in Russia, Caspian and Africa.
Production was 112,000 BOE per day, up from 88,000 BOE per day a year ago. This increase was primarily due to the
restart of our operations in Libya, partially offset by declines in Russia. Net income was a negative $19 million driven
by lower crude prices, high taxes and foreign exchange impacts. And for the company overall, the FX losses on this
segment generally offset the FX gains that I talked about in Europe. As we've indicated in the past, we are actively
marketing some of these assets in this segment as part of our $8 billion to $10 billion divestiture program.
So the final reporting segment I'll talk about is on Slide 20, our Corporate and Other segment. Since this is essentially a
cost segment, adjusted earnings were a negative $225 million this quarter. Costs contained in this segment include net
interest expense, corporate G&A, environmental costs, some FX impacts and our emerging businesses costs. A portion
of the former emerging business segment that you will recall from the integrated ConocoPhillips is now included as
part of this Corporate and Other segment.
For guidance purposes, I would suggest using $1 billion annually for this Corporate segment, so roughly another $500
million for the second half of this year.
So next, we'll turn to Slide 17 and talk about our operating segment margins and returns. The four pack of slides on this
page summarize our key financial metrics for the quarter. In the short run, prices overshadow the operational and
portfolio improvement successes we've had as a company. Looking year-over-year at the second quarter, the drop in
income per BOE is primarily driven by the $6 drop in realized prices we discussed earlier. And our cash contributions
and our return on capital and cash return on capital metrics follow this same trend.
And before turning the call back to Ryan to close up, I'll go through our year-to-date company cash flow on Slide 18.
To date, we've generated $7 billion of cash from continuing operations which excludes an increase in working capital
of about $600 million. We've also generated $1.6 billion from asset sales. To date, we've spent $8.2 billion in capital
which includes approximately $500 million of deepwater Angola exploration and Gulf of Mexico leasehold. It also
includes heavier spending on the APLNG project than we expect in the balance of 2012. We paid $1.7 billion in
dividends, continuing the same dividend rate as the pre-spin integrated ConocoPhillips. Related to the repositioning, the
net impact, cash flow impact, of the spin-off of Phillips 66 is $5.7 billion. This is a combination of all of the operating,
investing and spin-related transactions for the operations of what the assets that are now in Phillips 66.
During the first two quarters of the year, we also repurchased $4.9 billion of our shares and that left us with $6 billion
in total cash at the end of June including $5 billion in restricted cash and $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
During the third quarter this year, we expected to begin using some of these cash balances to reduce our debt balance.
So with that, I'll turn it back it to Ryan for some closing comments.
Ryan M. Lance
Thanks, Jeff. And if you could turn to Slide 19, I'll try to wrap up a little bit. I think the takeaway that we'd like to have
for you all for today's call is that the business is running well and our plans are on track. The spin-off of Phillips 66 was
a big milestone for the company and it successfully launched ConocoPhillips as an independent E&P company.

Operationally, we had a strong quarter and that part of the business is delivering on our expectations. Certainly our
focus will remain on returning value to the shareholders through our dividends and by executing on our major projects,
our exploration programs and our asset sales. The asset sales are important because they generate proceeds that help
fund our high return growth projects.
And we certainly will keep a close watch on the macro environment and we believe the investments that we're making
today are going to position the company to deliver on our long-term value proposition of 3% to 5% growth in
production and margins with improving, absolute financial returns and combining a sector-leading yield.
So that wraps up our summary that we had today and look forward to questions from the audience.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we have a
question from Faisel Khan from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Faisel.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Good morning.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Faisel.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: On Slide 5, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks the amount of cash flow you
expect to generate from operations under consensus estimates. I just want to clarify that, was that $40 billion, did you
say, in 2012 and 2013?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: No, the consensus cash from operations is not the $40 billion, we think, per year, it's in the $12
billion to $14 billion range.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: $12 billion to $14 billion. Okay. Great. Perfect.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah. So you add the $6 billion in cash on hand plus what we expect to get from asset
dispositions is what adds up to the $40 billion, Faisel.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Got it. Okay. And on Peng Lai, assuming you can get up to full operatable capacity,
what is that potential number over the long-term? Assuming you can get all the permits in place and be able to get back
to producing in all those fields?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, I think you ought to think in terms of 110,000 barrels a day to 120,000 barrels a day
gross.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So net back to us in the 40,000 BOE to 50,000 BOE per day level.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Got you.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: And that compares to around 60,000 BOE per day before the events.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Understood. And then at APLNG, given your reduced working interest now in the
facility and also given the project financing that you have in place, what kind of equity contributions will you have to –
will you be obligated to make to APLNG over the next sort of year or two?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So what we'll find is that over the second half of 2012, that the project financing and the fact
that the additional interest that Sinopec is going to acquire as part of the final investment decision on the second train
will fund most of our capital requirements for the balance of the year. And then we'll see lower capital requirements on

Thank you. Our next question comes from the Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi, guys. Good morning.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Paul.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Good morning.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: I very much like your continued clarity and also, really truly appreciate the level of disclosure that
you give. It is admirable.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Thank you.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: On the basic question of the cash flows, just one point, you didn't say anything about growing the
dividend, but I assume that's your aim?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, certainly, I think our strategic intent we talked about, is delivering 20% to 25% of our
cash flows back to the shareholder, primarily through the dividend channel and so, as we grow our production, grow
our earnings, grow our cash flows, that 20% to 25% is intended to grow as well.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay. I understand. It's actually also a very interesting target, I was going to move onto that, that
the idea that you would give back around a quarter of your cash flows. I guess what we're all struggling with, as you
mentioned, the consensus cash flows right now are $12 billion to $14 billion annually, which even arguably I think is
on a relatively aggressive oil price forecast. So that's why it's helpful to see the uses of cash by priority. I guess what
we're struggling with is the extent to which, over time, you're going to have to cut back that capital program. Could you
just talk more, yet, more about the sensitivity of the program and how much you could potentially cut that back to
balance your cash flows over the longer term? Thanks.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, so a couple comments there, Paul, first, as we've talked about, the company is going
through some fairly significant production growth and growth that's occurring at fairly high margin. So if you think
about us going from a production level of 1.5 MMBOED to 1.6 MMBOED, up to the 1.8 MMBOED to 1.9 MMBOED
kind of level over several years, that adds significant cash flow. And then, as we've talked before, that regardless of the
price environment we're in, by virtue of moving the portfolio more to liquids in, as well moving it more to jurisdictions
which have lower taxes, we're going to see margin improvement.
So as we look out over the next several years, the difference between what we're generating in terms of cash and capital
and dividends, of course, shrinks over time. What we're trying to lay out for you this morning is that in this interim time
period where it may not be covered, then we have other sources of cash to balance that gap, and we think it makes
sense to continue to invest in the capital that we have. Ryan, I don't know if you want to comment on where we might
cut capital if we – in a really lower price environment.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah. Certainly if – so we have seen some drop off here from Brent at $120 down to arguably
$100 reductions over the last – through this last quarter. We still think Brent in the $90-ish, $100 range is probably
reasonable over the short term, but if we saw some cycling down of prices and we felt like they were going to be here
for two or three years, we would make adjustments to our capital program. We're doing some of that through our

disposition process, but we've identified some high capital-requiring assets that we would like to dispose of.
We've got capability to throttle back on some of our exploitation spend across all of North America, really across the
whole global portfolio and we would look at that as well. We want to continue some of our – what we think are the
high quality, high margin, high return major projects. We're not going to whipsaw some of those right now, being some
of our ones in the North Sea, Norway, the U.K., Malaysia. Some of those we'd like to continue going. But we've got
some optionality in the portfolio if we saw lower prices were going to persist for a year or two.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, I think we've experienced over time too is that if – as prices come down and the activity
levels come down across the industry, you'll get the same amount of scope done for a lesser amount of money as well.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Yeah. If I think about the relationship you have between the asset sales and the share repurchases
and the commitments you made essentially to buy back shares through the first half of the year, where are we sitting
now on buybacks for the rest of 2012 and into the first half of 2013 and knowing what you're saying about asset sales
and share repurchases? Because it feels like you might be in the position to actually pretty much stop the buyback now.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, we completed the $5 billion that we said we would fund through the first half of the year.
Our priorities have kind of shifted with some of the reductions in the commodity prices that we've seen over the last
quarter. So as we look out ahead, the asset sales and dispositions will be used to help fund our capital program. If we
end up getting an increase in dispositions above kind of what we're forecasting or if commodity prices ramp back up a
little bit then that would leave room for us to consider more share repurchase.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Is that saying that basically the share repurchase has stopped now?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, they have stopped.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: I got you. Okay. All right, guys. I've asked you plenty of questions. Thanks a lot.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Thanks, Paul.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Paul.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Good morning, everyone. Just – you've laid out how cash flow margins are going to rise and
therefore cash is going to expand over time. Just still running through these cash balance numbers. Do you have a
number, I mean a rough range, obviously you don't know what you're going to sell, but for the CapEx that is associated
with the disposals?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: If you looked at had we disposed of – a rough range, yeah. If we would have disposed of
everything that was on our – that they were contemplating as asset dispositions as of the beginning of this year, it
probably would have taken $1 billion to $1.5 billion of capital out of this year's capital program.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Right. And so that will free up that CapEx plus maybe once APLNG has got through to invest
more aggressively in shale?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, I think as we look forward over the next – right now, we would think that our capital
expenditures in 2013 are going to be in the range of $15 billion, and that includes, as you mentioned, a fairly – a
continuation of the aggressive investment levels we're doing in the Lower 48 in the resource plays.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And then obviously as you look through divisional disclosure, Canada is suffering, maybe you
could say Bakken and Permian are suffering from low realizations. Apart from others building pipes to help you get to
higher realizations on the production you're getting there, I mean, can you talk through your strategy to try and
maximize realization for those onshore assets?

<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, Ed, we talked a little about that in terms of the 2012 capital that we see clarity on for the
rest of the year, and part of that is spending a fair amount of infrastructure to help our realizations and make sure we
can move the product where it's getting bottlenecked and make sure we can get it sold. So, we're doing a fair amount of
that where it makes sense, where there's competition and where we can get to third parties for reasonable costs, we will
do that, but we're also focused on spending our own capital if we need to, building our own infrastructure to make sure
that we're maximizing the realizations.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Final one from me, you mentioned the Mancos. Any results you can share from them? And I
do see your permitting down in your acreage down in Southern Louisiana. Are there any results or targets that you're
probing there?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, none that I think we can disclose today, it's still a pretty competitive position. We wanted
to talk a little bit about the Mancos because obviously we've got a lot of that acreage held by production. So we're still
studying that and hope to have results later this year.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Thank you. I just wanted to clarify the stock buyback commentary. I think we've all
thought that future asset sales, those proceeds would be used to buy back shares. It sounds like it's not probably as
direct going forward. It'll be a function of what cash is available. Is that accurate?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, I think that's fair, Arjun.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: That's great. And then in terms of the – so, you're going to spend $16 billion in capital
this year. You have a $15 billion-ish number for next year and long-term. Does that contemplate the $8 billion to $10
billion of asset sales or would that $15 billion-ish kind of number come down once you're finished with your asset
sales?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: No, we think that, that's as we look at the portfolio, look at the opportunity set, look what
we've added in the North American unconventionals, we look out over time and $15 billion feels like a pretty
reasonable kind of capital figure if commodity prices hang in at kind of today's level or even a bit softer.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: That's great. That makes sense. And then just last one from me, some of the peer
companies in Australia LNG have had some budget increases. My understanding is you all had more of a contingency
built into your budget, but just wondered if you could comment on what you're seeing down there and how good you
do feel about the current budget? Thank you.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, I know we have seen some announcements. When we came out, we felt like all along,
Arjun, that a one-train project or a two-train project on Curtis Island was about $20 billion. That was our estimate a
couple years ago, and we haven't seen anything to think that that would be any different. I think the other projects are
just now realizing what it's going to cost on Curtis Island.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Great. Thank you so much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gammel from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Yes. Thank you. I had a few more on APLNG, if I could please. First of all on the upstream
program, I believe you guys are actually a fair bit ahead of the other projects that are going forward in Queensland. But
can you talk about what type of a forward drilling program that you need to have to match the upstream with the
downstream requirements, I guess in terms of number of wells to be drilled? And then also in terms of rigs that you
would need to run?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I might have to get back with you on the specifics with that, but I think we're running today, a
3-rig, 4-rig program, and feel like we've got, with the efficiencies that we're gaining and the number of wells we're
drilling on a daily and a monthly basis, we're ramping up the well count in front of the start-up of the first train. So
when the first train's ready to come on line in 2015, we'll have the supply ready to go. And then we're continuing to
drill because six to nine months later, the second train will come on line. So we continue to drill and have the upstream
capacity available for that.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Sure. And I suppose the logistics are obviously fairly difficult trying to match that number
of wells with the requirement that you have, so do you feel that the arrangements that you have commercially with the
domestic market and some of the other projects give you more flexibility in how you manage that upstream process?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, I think we're probably uniquely positioned there because we're selling over 200 million
BOE a day to the domestic market today and we've got the ability to de-water wells and throw wells into the domestic
market [ph] in knots (48:02). We've got a lot more flexibility to be able to manage our available capacity on the front
end to make sure when the plant is ready to go that we can deliver the gas to the plant.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: And then one more on APLNG, if I could, please. You mentioned that you have project
financing in place. Can you talk about, just in rough numbers, what percentage of the overall capital requirements will
come from the project financing facility?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: The project financing that was completed, well, the agreements were signed back in the second
quarter, is an $8.5 billion project financing, so it's sort of roughly 40% of the requirements.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Great. And, Jeff, how much cumulative cash flow would you need to generate to repay
whatever principal you have to do first and fund any contingency accounts before APLNG could start dividend-ing
cash back to you?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: The repayment of the financing happens over a long period of time, so as soon as APLNG starts
up, it'll start paying out a dividend.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Okay, so you wouldn't have any contingency account funding that would have to come in
front of dividend payments to the partner group?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No, that's going to be part of what gets funded overall with the project. So when we start up, we
will begin to make distributions.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Jason.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Thanks. Good morning. If I could tack onto the APLNG question. I'm just curious, you've
sanctioned the second train, obviously that's helped with scalability and efficiency and should improve overall returns.
I'm just curious, given the second quarter return on capital employed for the entire company at around 11%, do you
think this project will be accretive to overall returns?

Page 13 of 18
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I think APLNG will be accretive to overall returns in the long term, but it will be a challenge to
our overall returns in the near term and that's pretty consistent with all long-life projects where you end up putting a lot
of capital on the books up front and then you get that back over a long period of time. So, it's probably not accretive in
the short term, will be accretive in the long term.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Got it. Great.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: But it is – the issue there is the reason you've seen us dilute from our – or willing to sell equity
to a marketing entity to purchase a portion of the project and our willingness to be able to do that and that's caused us to
go from the 50% down to a 37.5% and we're looking for probably some opportunities for some further dilution at
APLNG.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay. Great. Thank you. The second question was on the exploration front. Ryan, I know
you gave us a few impact wells going down in the Gulf of Mexico. I was just curious, is there anything else globally
that we should be aware of that could be high impact and then I know you mentioned Angola seismic, could you give
us an idea when we may spud the first well there?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I think we're looking in Angola at the end of 2013, early 2014 for a well. We're in the middle
of capturing 3D seismic. I think we pretty much completed our initial program in Bangladesh. And we'll get that data in
so that well has probably been pushed out. The other one I would probably point out in terms of impact is we're at the
front end of our Poseidon appraisal program in Browse Basin of Australia, but that'll be probably a year-long five-well
or six-well program.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Doug.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Good morning.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: A couple of things from me. When you did the separation, Ryan, you projected or you laid out at
least projections that were assuming $120 Brent at that time. The margin improvement assumption of 3% to 5%, I
guess had that as a backdrop. If you had to reset, I'm guessing why you haven't reset your assumptions to what the
futures curve looks like right now and would that change the margin improvement? That's my first question.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, the – yeah, I know we continue to get some of those questions, Doug. I'd just remind
everybody, when we came out in April and we described that a little bit, we were trying to describe what current prices
were and how the margin would improve. The important part is, as we look at the portfolio and we look at where we're
investing the money, whether you pick $120, $100 or $90 oil or $80 oil, our margin is going to improve on a flat-price
basis and we believe the 3% to 5% is coming at a flat price.
So, it's not reliant on $120. So as we look at our plans today and we look at the investments that we're making relative
to the existing portfolio, our margins are going to be improving over the next three to five years. And we – the absolute

production growth and the margin growth is coming and we're investing in things that are changing the mix in the
portfolio and are changing the tax burden on the company as well.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it. I've just got a couple other quick ones, if I may. It's really related – I guess that's where
my confusion comes. It's related to that issue of mix. So when you look at Australia LNG, that's a very large part of
your incremental, organic growth. I certainly had discussions with your team about this, but the implied – the IRR you
presented on Australia LNG was showing 8% to 10% at your internal assumptions. Can you share with us how those
assumptions differ from your cash flow assumptions? In other words, $120 oil. Because what I'm trying to figure out is
an old oil price assumption with so much of your growth coming from APLNG, how does that then jive with the
incremental improvement in cash margin at 8% to 10% IRR?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So, maybe a couple clarifications there, Doug. So the 8% to 10% IRR is not what you would
have at $120 oil price. You'd be doing much better than that at a $120 oil price. So when we talk about margins, we're
talking about cash margins. So when APLNG starts up, you're getting a significant return of – you're getting a return on
your capital and you're getting your capital back as well. So the cash margins are going to be pretty robust on that
project kind of regardless of what price environment that we're in. So that will be a significant source of cash for us
upon the start-up.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: What I'm trying to figure out, Jeff, is – well, can you share with us what commodity assumption
does equate to 8% to 10%?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: That was more on a $90 tough-type price environment.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. So at $90 per barrel, would that still be accretive to cash margins?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yes.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Final one then from me is on the disposals, $8 billion to $10 billion. Can you give us
some scale of production and cash flow associated with those? And I'll leave it at that. Thanks.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: From a production standpoint, like we've said before, it'll depend upon the mix because there's –
in that $8 billion to $10 billion, there's a mix of assets that are currently producing and currently not producing. So
impacts on current production are probably in the 50,000 barrel a day type range and depending upon the mix, it could
vary plus or minus 25,000 barrels a day on either side of that. And then cash flows I don't think I have a number that we
can throw out to you on that.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Iain Reid from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Hi. Morning, guys.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Jeff, could I just go back to your comments on the U.K. part of the business. And you were talking
about the impact of the tax change on abandonment...
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: And you mentioned a number, which is going to affect, I think you said third quarter earnings. If
you just confirm what that is and whether it's a one-time charge? And what the kind of ongoing effect on DD&A could
be?

<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: That is a one-time charge of around $175 million and that just really reflects the fact that when
the U.K. increased tax rates earlier – well, it was last year, up to around the 62% range, they said they might be coming
out later with some restrictions on how much you could deduct on abandonment obligations. They've done that now
and so that only – you only get 50% tax relief on abandonment obligations. That mark of our deferred tax liability
down to reflect that change is what the $175 million would be. So it will be a one-time special item type event in the
third quarter.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: And there won't be any kind of ongoing effect on your DD&A per barrel rate?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: There could be some – no, no, no, there isn't because it's just...
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: That's just a – that's a before-tax item.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. And secondly on NGL pricing, there's going to be a fair amount of investments in
infrastructure, et cetera. I just wonder when you look at these very depressed prices you're getting in the Lower 48, how
long you expect those to have such a big margin to oil prices going forward? And whether you've thought about any
sort of hedging program for the – obviously it's not a great time to hedge now, but whether that was something which
you might want to look to protect in the future?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So, NGLs, as we pointed out, are around globally about 9% of our production and the Lower 48
and Canadian portion of that is like 6% or 7% of our production. As we look across over time, if you roll the clock
forward several years, our NGL production we would anticipate to be relatively flat and with – our growth is going to
be coming from crude oil production. So we don't have increasing exposure to NGLs going forward.
I think we see that the market is going to be fairly soft particularly for ethane in the near term which is what's really
driving down the overall price of NGLs, but that will get solved with all the capacity expansions that you're hearing
talked about in the chemicals side of the business right now. So we don't think it's a long-term phenomenon but that
kind of low NGL prices is going to attract additional investment.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. And my last one – I'm going to come back to APLNG, I'm afraid. The other guys have
announced big increases. Also they've talked about the translational effects of the Aussie dollar. And I presume when
you launch this project, you're looking at a much lower level of the Aussie dollar versus U.S. dollar. Does that $20
billion budget you have, do you cover this kind of big increase in Aussie dollar exchange rates? Because I believe that's
a fairly substantial portion of the overall CapEx denominated in local currency.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: It is. I mean, that number reflects our current estimates with where the market looks now on the
Australian dollar, but that continues to be – like with the other projects, that continues to be one of the larger exposures
we have on the project is if there is a further weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Aussie dollar.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: So is it fair to say you probably used up all the contingency you had initially on that project?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No. I wouldn't say that. I'd say that we feel like the numbers that we had out there now still have
contingency in them.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks.

<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Paul.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: First, I want to echo the earlier comment that I want to thank you for the expense disclosure,
very helpful and appreciate.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thank you.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: But just one possible request. It seems that you're going to break out the earnings by different
regions. Can you also break out your exploration expense in the future by the corresponding region? That would be
helpful in the modeling. And that, Ryan, in your presentation that you gave, the production and the margin
improvement target, do you have a proven reserve growth target?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, certainly, Paul, we expect over time to be more than replacing the production. So we
haven't come out and said exactly what it is, but it's clearly targets over 100%. It'll be lumpy and there'll be years when
it probably dramatically exceeds it and years when it'd be right at it.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Should we assume that you were trying to hold your R-P rates flat? Or that that's not really a
target?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I don't think about, Paul, trying to hold R to P flat. In fact, as we shift our investments in some
of these higher margin, the profiles of some of these investments, I actually expect our R to P will go down a little bit
over time, not a lot but will trend down versus trying to trend flat.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And just on the asset sales, just want to clarify, that $8 billion to $10 billion for 2012 and
2013, does it already include the $1.6 billion year-to-date? And also, do you expect a farm down on the APLNG?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So we do include – we think about that number as a 2012 and 2013 number. The farm down on
APLNG ends up being a contribution into the joint venture, so it's not an asset sale. So -
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. So APLNG is not included but the $1.6 billion year-to-date is included?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And since I got you, Jeff, that I think you guys have an [ph] open lid (62:34) in the second
quarter around 29,000 barrel per day. What region that has come from? And also as of the end of June 30, your guys
balance are still net overweight – [ph] over met (62:50)?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Paul, we'll have to get back to you on that. I don't have that right in front of me.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: All right.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: We'll get back to you, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Thank you.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our final question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Baber>: This is Guy Baber here in for Jeff. Thanks for taking my call. I was hoping you guys could talk a
little bit more about current and planned activity levels and what you're seeing in the Permian Basin? And specifically,
wondering if you had any update with respect to pilot programs in the Avalon and the Wolfcamp? Any comments there
will be appreciated.

<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, yeah, we've got quite a bit of activity going on. As Jeff described earlier, we have seven
rigs running in the Permian Basin. And those are all targeting some of the existing conventional opportunities that we
have, but largely focused on the unconventionals. It's mostly liquids investments in all of the Permian. So we're active
in piloting and drilling both the Wolfcamp and some of the other plays in the Permian Basin. So, yeah, we're pretty
active there right now.
<Q - Guy Baber>: Okay. Thanks. And I also had a strategic portfolio management-type of question. But, Ryan, as you
look at the existing portfolio, are there any gaps or areas where you're lacking exposure now that you would like to
enhance your position in? And then relatedly, internationally, the focus has largely been OECD geographically to limit
risk and that's worked well for you all. Should we assume that that remains the case going forward? And would that
preclude you from potentially entering some of these international plays that may offer significant long-term resource
potential, but do carry a higher-risk profile? And I'm thinking of some plays like East Africa for one or even Kurdistan
region of Iraq. Any comments there would be appreciated.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, I mean, as I look at the portfolio, I'd say we're more after low cost to supply
opportunities, whether that's gas or oil, where we can make a competitive rate of return within our portfolio. As I look
at that, today, you see our heavy focus on unconventionals in North America because we see a lot of opportunity that
are working well. We've got a great position, and so a large part of our investments are going there. But internationally,
I'd say, as you see from our exploration, we're growing our deepwater position and that's not only in the Gulf of
Mexico, but also Angola and the subsalt opportunity there, Bangladesh. We're offshore Sabah Island in Malaysia, so
you'll see some things that we're doing in the deepwater. We think the liquids-focused deepwater investments make a
lot of sense.
So I think as we think about it, going around it's really opportunity by opportunity, but looking for a good low cost to
supply and looking for areas. So even, playing the Barents Sea in Norway makes sense to us right now. And you've
seen us capture some acreage positions up there. So in terms of holes, I don't think we have a hole that we're really
trying to plug; we're just really focused on value and focused on returns, making sure that what we do go after and
capture competes well within our existing portfolio. As you said, we're largely OECD today. So we can take on a little
bit more risk in terms of political risk in something like that if we think the returns are going to be competitive.
<Q - Guy Baber>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the comments.
