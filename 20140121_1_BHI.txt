Hello, my name is Lorraine, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to
the Baker Hughes Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. All the lines have been placed on mute to prevent
any background noise.
After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Trey Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed.
Trey Clark
Thank you, Lorraine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Baker Hughes fourth quarter 2013 earnings
conference call. Here with me today is our Chairman and CEO, Martin Craighead; and Peter Ragauss, Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation and the earnings release that was issued earlier today can
be found on our website, at bakerhughes.com.
As a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide predictions, forecasts and other
forward-looking statements. Although, they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of
future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review our SEC filings for a
discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, reconciliation of operating
profit and other non-GAAP measures to GAAP results can be found on our earnings release and on our website at

Thanks, Trey, and good morning. I'll begin my remarks with a brief review of our 2013 results.
We ended 2013 with revenue of $22.4 billion which is a record for Baker Hughes. Our revenue growth in 2013 was
almost entirely driven by the Eastern Hemisphere where we continue to build critical mass in a variety of key markets,
particularly Africa, the Middle East, and Russia Caspian. The Western Hemisphere was marked by activity declines in
several markets, particularly the United States, Brazil, and Mexico where rig counts and well counts are below 2012
levels.
In Latin America, we adjusted and realigned our business to account for lower activity levels. And as such, we were
able to exceed our margin objectives for the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the actions we've taken and the steps we
continue to take will position this segment for better profitability going forward.
In North America, the ongoing overhaul of our U.S. Pressure Pumping business continues to gain momentum. As such,
we saw margins increased in all four quarters last year, and we expect this to continue. Outside of Pressure Pumping,
our other product lines posted solid results, particularly our Completion Systems, Artificial Lift, and Upstream
Chemicals.
An unexpected operational challenge occurred last year in the fourth quarter when our Iraq business experienced a
significant disruption resulting in a complete shutdown of our operations. We took immediate action to ensure the
safety of our people, and I'm thankful to local authorities and our customers who provided assistance. With additional
security measures in place, we were able to resume activities by the end of December. The short-term losses in Iraq are
disappointing, but the well-being of our people will always take precedence.
Our Middle East/Asia Pacific operation progressed very well in 2013, Iraq disruptions notwithstanding. Revenue in this
region grew 24% over the prior year, and margins expanded from 10% into the mid-teens.
2013 also saw the rapid growth of several important young technologies. The AutoTrak Curve rotary steerable drilling
service, Talon PDC drill bits, and FracPoint sliding sleeve systems are a few of the meaningful contributors to the
efficiency gains our customers are achieving in the North American shale plays. We're also driving efficiencies in
offshore markets with technology such as the multizone, single-trip completion system and coiled-tubing drilling
services. We once again increased our research and development investment in 2013, expanding our core services to
include critical capabilities and emerging technologies. SureTrak steerable drilling liner service, Rhino Bifuel pumping
technology and FLEX pump ESPs are just a sample of the 129 new products and services commercially launched in
2013.
We also grew our expertise in reservoir development via new relationship with CGG, and we saw our early success
with our JewelSuite reservoir modeling software, including a significant software license and joint product
development agreement with Shell in the third quarter. At the same time, we are leveraging these capabilities to secure
long-term field management projects; including wins on the Soledad project in Mexico and the D18 field in Malaysia.
Turning to financial performance, a key priority for 2013 was to improve free cash flow to allow us greater flexibility
to improve shareholder returns. I'm pleased with our results so far. Through a disciplined approach to capital
expenditures and a number of actions to reduce working capital, we saw a significant improvement. In fact, last year we
generated the highest free cash flow in the history of Baker Hughes. And based on our positive outlook for the future,
during the fourth quarter we repurchased $350 million of shares on the open market. At the same time, we reduced our
debt and increased cash, ending the year with a stronger balance sheet.
Later in today's call, I'll share my outlook for our business and why I'm very optimistic about the coming years for
Baker Hughes. But first, let me turn it over to Peter for additional details on the quarter and our guidance on the
near-term. Peter?

Thanks, Martin, and good morning. Today, we reported adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of $277 million or
$0.62 per share. Adjusted net income excludes $29 million in after-tax severance costs or $0.06 per share. However,
adjusted net income includes before and after-tax losses of $79 million or $0.18 per share in Iraq.
The loss in Iraq is primarily related to the significant disruption of operations previously highlighted during the quarter,
expenses associated with personnel movements and security measures, and other non-recurring items.
As Martin mentioned, we resumed operations in Iraq by the end of the year. On a GAAP basis, net income attributable
to Baker Hughes for the fourth quarter was $248 million or $0.56 per share. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.86
billion, a third consecutive record quarter for Baker Hughes.
Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue is up $535 million or 10% despite the loss of revenue in Iraq. Adjusted
EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $955 million. For the full year, as Martin highlighted, we posted record revenue of
$22.36 billion, which was up 5% or $1 billion from the prior year. This growth is primarily driven by our international
operations in the Eastern Hemisphere.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $3.7 billion and adjusted net income was $1.17 billion or $2.62 per share. On a
GAAP basis, net income for the year was $1.1 billion or $2.47 per share.
To help in your understanding of the quarter's results, I'll bridge last quarter's earnings per share to this quarter. In the
third quarter, we posted GAAP net income of $0.77 per share. First, add back $0.04 for severance costs, which were
highlighted in the third quarter. That brings us to a third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.81. Next, add that $0.09 for bad
debt reserves recognized in Latin America in the third quarter.
Moving to the fourth quarter, subtract $0.08 for North America operations due to weather delays and holiday
seasonality in the United States, unfavorable product mix in the Gulf of Mexico and activity weakness in Canada. Add
$0.05 for Latin America as our actions to improve profitability were executed as planned and we benefited from strong
activity and product sales in Argentina and Colombia.
Add $0.01 for Eastern Hemisphere operations were strong year end product sales in Asia Pacific and Russia Caspian
were offset by activity delays in the North Sea due to inclement weather along with mobilization costs associated with
new contracts in Africa.
Subtract $0.03 for corporate expenses and subtract $0.05 for higher taxes and interest. Income taxes increased primarily
due to geographic mix of sales. At this point our earnings per share would have been $0.80.
Next, subtract $0.18 for the after-tax loss in Iraq as previously highlighted. That brings us to adjusted earnings per
share of $0.62 this quarter. To get the GAAP earnings per share of $0.56, subtract another $0.06 for $29 million in
after-tax severance costs.
In table five of our earnings release, we've provided adjusted financial information excluding the impact of the
severance costs. From this point on in the conference call any comments on revenue, operating profit and operating
profit margin refer explicitly to table five in our earnings release unless otherwise stated.
Taking a closer look at our results from operations, revenue in North America was $2.74 billion; down $110 million
were 4% sequentially. North American adjusted operating profit was $241 million, down $54 million sequentially. In
our U.S. onshore business, revenue was down due to seasonal activity reductions during the holiday period along with
unusually poor weather in the southern and western areas of the United States in November and December.
In the Gulf of Mexico, revenue and margins declined sequentially due to an unfavorable mix of sales, weather delays
associated with Tropical Storm Karen and the delay of several deepwater stimulation projects until 2014. Canada, a
decline in the oil-directed rig count and associated well count resulted in a decline in operating margins for this
geomarket. The profitability impact of the revenue reduction in North America was partially offset by improved profit
margins in our U.S. Pressure Pumping business and continued growth in our Artificial Lift business.

Moving to international results, we posted record revenue of $2.77 billion, up $165 million or 6% versus the prior
quarter and up $299 million or 12% compared to a year ago. Excluding costs associated with Iraq in the fourth quarter
and bad debt charges recognized in Latin America in prior periods, international operating profit increased to a record
$406 million, up $42 million or 12% sequentially. Compared to the same quarter of 2012, operating profit increased by
$81 million or 25%.
Our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment delivered record revenue for the quarter despite the Iraq disruption. This record
performance can be attributed to increased product sales in Asia Pacific and the Arabian Gulf. Additionally, we
benefited from strong activity in Australia and Vietnam.
If not for the Iraq disruption and other non-recurring costs, our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment would have generated
operating profit margins of approximately 15% which is similar to the prior quarter and over 500 basis points higher
when compared to the same quarter of last year. Much of the year-over-year profit improvement can be attributed to
our Asia Pacific operations where ongoing initiatives to improve profitability are taking hold.
In our Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian segment, a reduction of high margin revenue in the North Sea resulting from
weather delays was more than offset by lower margin product sales in Russia Caspian and Africa as well as higher
activity in continental Europe.
As a result of this unfavorable geographic mix and mobilization costs associated with new projects in Africa, operating
profit margins declined by 200 basis points sequentially despite an increase in revenue of $62 million.
In Latin America, strong service activity and product sales in Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador resulted in revenues of
$603 million, up $46 million or 8% sequentially.
Excluding bad debt in the third quarter, operating profit increased $33 million or 87% from the previous quarter. These
strong incremental profits were driven in part by the increased revenue but more importantly by a sizeable reduction in
costs following the restructuring of our business to match current market conditions.
Overall operating profit margins were 11.8%, an increase of 490 basis points sequentially. For our Industrial Services
segment, we posted record revenue of $346 million, up $18 million sequentially. Operating profit was $35 million and
operating profit margin was 10%.
Looking at the balance sheet, during the quarter, we generated $649 million of free cash flow and ended the quarter
with a cash balance of $1.4 billion or an increase of $31 million sequentially. Our strong free cash flow was supported
by a $280 million reduction in accounts receivable and inventory.
The reduction in working capital is a result of new sustainable processes that were put in place during the year. As a
result, over the course of 2013, we reduced our cash conversion cycle by 18 days. We generated $1.5 billion in free
cash flow for the year, a record for Baker Hughes. And we plan to carry this momentum forward into 2014.
Total debt decreased $194 million during the quarter to $4.4 billion and we ended the year with a total debt to capital
ratio of 19.7%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $533 million. For the year, capital expenditures totaled $2.1
billion, down $822 million or 28% from 2012. And finally, as previously announced, we repurchased 6.3 million shares
on the open market during the fourth quarter totaling $350 million.
Now, let me provide you with our guidance for 2014. For North America, we project a modest increase in onshore
activity driven by continued improvement in drilling efficiencies and incremental deepwater rigs entering the Gulf of
Mexico.
For U.S. onshore, we anticipate that the rig count will be essentially flat compared to last year, to a final 2014 exit rate
of 1,710 rigs composed of approximately 1,350 oil rigs and 360 gas rigs. Despite the flat rig count forecast as a result
of continued drilling efficiencies, we anticipate that the U.S. onshore well count will increase 5% compared to last year.
U.S. offshore rig count is expected to increase 5% to 60 rigs in 2014. In Canada, the first quarter rig count is projected
to reach peak levels for the year with 550 average rigs including 180 gas rigs and 370 oil rigs. This will be slightly

above the average rig count from the first quarter of 2013, driven by a 35% increase in gas-directed rigs and offset by a
5% reduction in oil-directed rigs. The average Canadian rig count for 2014 is expected to be 370 rigs, a 5% increase
compared to 2013.
Regarding our operations in North America, with the holiday period behind us and presumably no significant
weather-related delays, we expect our first quarter 2014 North America profit margins to recover at least 150 basis
points.
Looking internationally, we are projecting a solid increase in market growth in the coming year. The average rig count
is anticipated to grow to 1,430 rigs in 2014, led by the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Africa. This growth represents a
10% increase in the international rig count. Consistent with the years past, we expect that each of our international
operating segments will see a slight reduction in revenue and margins during the first quarter due to year end product
sales that do not repeat, as well as normal winter seasonality in Russia and Northern Asia.
Industrial Services activity is expected to drop in the first quarter due to typical seasonal declines in our Process and
Pipeline Services business with results expected to look similar as the first quarter of last year.
To summarize, we expect the seasonal decline of our International and Industrial segments will be offset by increased
profitability in North America. As a result, earnings for the first quarter should be slightly up when compared to fourth
quarter adjusted earnings when we exclude the impact of Iraq.
For the full year 2014, interest expense is expected to be between $240 million and $250 million. Corporate costs are
expected to be between $260 million and $270 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be
between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be about $2 billion. And finally,
our 2014 effective tax rate is expected to be between 32% and 33%.
At this point, I will now turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks. As Peter just highlighted, based on the solid growth in rig counts and well counts and the growing demand for
technology-driven well construction and production solutions, the outlook for Baker Hughes this year is very good.
Let me share a few examples of where we are starting to see differential market traction with key customers around the
world, starting with our Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian business. The offshore markets in Europe, West Africa, and the
Caspian play very well to our strength in delivering highly-reliable and highly-innovative well construction solutions.
A year ago in Norway, we mobilized for one of the largest Drilling Services contracts in the history of our industry.
And today, I'm pleased to announce another win in the North Sea of similar magnitude.
In the fourth quarter, Statoil awarded Baker Hughes a major multi-year contract for the provision of Completions
services in Norway. This award covers the majority of Statoil's fields and represents a significant increase for our
Completions business in Norway, solidifying our position as the market leader for Completion Systems in the North
Sea.
Our Middle East/Asia Pacific business is our fastest growing segment in the world. In 2013, it grew 24% over the prior
year to become our largest international segment. Based on our forecast of strong rig count growth across the region,
and recent strategic wins, we expect this trend will continue in 2014.
Late last year, we announced that Baker Hughes and PETRONAS Carigali entered into a long-term Oilfield Service
Agreement to increase production in the Greater D18 field. We began mobilization during the fourth quarter, and today
we are drilling the first of several appraisal wells.
In Australia, we are expanding our share in the growing deepwater market.

During the fourth quarter, we were awarded a three-year contract to provide wireline and drilling services to a large
Australian independent. The Middle East and Asia Pacific have evolved into an opportunity-rich area, more so today
than I can ever remember. Accordingly, we will respond to these growing opportunities that best match our strengths.
Turning to Latin America, I would describe this region as our most improved segment. We took a number of actions
during the second half of the year to improve profitability and reduce risk. Looking ahead, we expect to continue
increasing margins in this segment.
Yet our plans for improved profitability in Latin America is not predicated upon more revenue. In fact, it's probable
that our revenue in Latin America will remain flat this year as we reduce our exposure to markets where activity is
uncertain and collections are doubtful. We will replace those reductions with other opportunities in the region which
provide lower risks and higher margins. The result will be less working capital and a more stable mix of business going
forward.
One area where we intend to grow is in the Andean geomarket. Last quarter, we were awarded multiple contracts to
provide well construction services for a major development campaign over the next three years in the Colombian
foothills. This is one of the most challenging onshore drilling environments in Latin America and it involves very deep,
highly-deviated wells, and extremely complex formations. This environment fits our portfolio and capabilities
perfectly.
Also during the fourth quarter, we mobilized for our new exploration and development contract in the Soledad field in
Mexico. This begins a 35-year production enhancement agreement, leveraging our success on the neighboring
Corralillo field where we use new technologies and project management capabilities to triple production in less than
four years.
Overall, international operations are expected to continue solid, profitable growth in 2014 as recent contract wins take
hold and the demand for high-end technology and reliable products and services continues to grow.
Turning to North America, this is the segment where we have strong potential to accelerate earnings through the
introduction and integration of new technologies and improved efficiencies. Drill bits, Drilling Services, Upstream
Chemicals, Artificial Lift and Completion Systems all performed exceptionally well in 2013, leveraging innovative
new products to enhance shale production.
And in my opinion, there are still tremendous opportunities for companies like Baker Hughes when it comes to the
development of new technologies and methodologies that will drive the next phase of drilling and production
efficiencies. Innovation, entrepreneurialism and experimentation are some of the hallmarks of the North American
shale revolution and have created a rich set of service options.
Optimizing production from shale is not a one-size-fits-all operation. It requires a portfolio of capabilities to provide
basin-specific and well-specific customization. We believe our customer community within the unconventional plays
will increasingly require products and services that not only drive efficiency but more importantly enable them to
improve initial production rates and their EURs per well.
FracPoint and OptiPort were purpose-built for the North American shale plays. Sliding sleeve products like these were
designed to reduce the time to complete a well and maximize production. Today, sliding sleeve systems are used on
about 30% of all unconventional wells, helping our customers cut days off the time to complete a well.
Yet for many North American customers, the traditional plug and perf operation remains the completion method of
choice. This is the same method used to complete some of the earliest shale wells, and yet this is a method that hasn't
evolved much since the beginning of the shale revolution.
Last year, we assembled a team of completions experts, many of the same experts who developed FracPoint and
OptiPort and tasked them with developing a new innovative product, one that delivers improved efficiency for the plug
and perf market. And today, I'm pleased to announce that we are launching a new technology that represents a step
change in plug and perf operations.

It's a technology we call Shadow plug, a newly-designed large bore isolation device which incorporates an IN-Tallic
frac ball, the same disintegrating material we developed for our FracPoint system. Now, as shown in these images, the
Shadow plug is set, the well is perforated and then the well is stimulated. Once the well stimulation is complete, the
ball disintegrates away leaving behind a large flow-through ID ready for production and eliminating the need to
mill-out the plugs.
This latest innovation is a further extension of our nanotechnology suite. And from a customer perspective, this
technology provides a number of advantages such as the elimination of costly milling time, reduced cost and time save
to complete a well, and the ability to reach longer laterals beyond the current limitations of coiled-tubing. And all of
these advantages allow our customers to bring their well on production even sooner.
Now we've been field-testing Shadow plugs with a handful of select customers for several months now. And based on
the early success of this technology, we are accelerating the commercial launch of this product during the first quarter,
providing a revolutionary enhancement for customers using traditional plug and perf. The Shadow plug is the first in a
series of products targeted to advance our entire portfolio of unconventional multistage completions.
This service integration concept is being proven with our ProductionWave solution launched last year.
ProductionWave is a family of services tailored to boost production and reduce lifting costs in unconventional wells. It
incorporates artificial lift, production chemicals and remote monitoring technologies to create a more effective
alternative to traditional rod lift hardware.
And I'm pleased to report remarkable market response to our ProductionWave service. In the first six months since
launch, sales have been very strong with installations in every major U.S. basin. Of these new installations, more than
half were installed on wells where rod lift had previously been the only artificial lift system available.
Our customers are benefiting from increased production rates while avoiding the high costs associated with rod lift
change outs. And by integrating real-time monitoring capabilities, ProductionWave provides our customers with
critical real-time production data which is used to maximize initial production rates and their EURs.
We are forecasting continued strong demand for ProductionWave especially in fields that produce high gas content
which can be problematic for rod lift systems. Interestingly and to that point, for the first time last quarter, we installed
the ProductionWave system for a customer who previously used gas lift systems in their field exclusively.
In North America and internationally, we will continue to innovate and integrate service combinations like
ProductionWave and Shadow plug which has specifically addressed three of the industry's key objectives. To reduce
well complexity, optimize drilling efficiency and improve ultimate recovery.
Innovation is the cornerstone of our strategy to create long-term shareholder value. At the same time and equally
important, we remain 100% focused on the near-term, improving the quality of our earnings, remaining capital
disciplined and generating free cash flows.
And with that, Trey, let's turn it over for some questions.

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes
from James West from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - James C. West>: Hey, good morning guys.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Good morning, James.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning.
<Q - James C. West>: So, Martin, Peter free cash flow generation really impressive in 2013 and I know this can be a
focus going forward both in capital discipline and keeping working capital down. Was there anything in 2013 that was
a one-off or some type of a catch up which makes it harder to achieve this level of cash flow generation going forward
or is this – is it a level relative to revenue or however you look at it, that we should think about in 2014?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Thanks for recognizing that James. We put a lot of hard work into working capital
particularly this year. I wouldn't say anything as a one-off. In fact, we probably set a new baseline in some of our days
outstanding whether it's DSOs or days payable. And we put a big focus on it this year. We put in some new processes
particularly around billing and invoicing that helped our receivable reduction in particular.
So, I think there's probably more to do on the receivable side going into 2014. So, I wouldn't expect this big as decrease
in working capital...
<Q - James C. West>: Okay.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: ...in 2014 but some decrease in sort of the days sales outstanding. But I got to commend the
teams, though, because we put some stretched targets out there, and they exceeded every one of them, so, they did a
really good job in 2013.
<Q - James C. West>: Yes. Great. Very impressive. Perhaps on the little bit of unrelated follow-up here. But, Martin,
you made comment about your North American Pressure Pumping business, four quarters in a row of improved
profitability. At this point, are we firmly profitable in that area or is there still a lot more room to go, I mean, is there
still a lot more upside in your North American margins as a result of that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: James, I don't want to comment on a particular product line's profitability performance.
I'll tell you that I don't think we're on the fairway yet, and we have a lot of opportunity to center this business relative to
the market. We have a – as we've laid out in the past, a really, really solid plan, great metrics, milestones, plan's
working. I mean, no one wants to go faster than I do.
<Q - James C. West>: Sure.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: But it's – we're getting there and we know what to do and I'm very confident, but I'd like
to avoid the profitability answer.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.

year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, absolutely. So, Jim, you've been – like a lot of the other listeners have been with us
for quite a while. And seven, eight years, five years ago, we had some challenges in a couple countries in West Africa.
I think a lot of our customers, you guys stuck with us and it's starting to pay off dividends, even winning some nice
contracts. Our brand is much stronger than it's ever been both with the national oil companies as well as – well, it's
always been strong with the IOCs, but we've made a lot of nice gains and our customers are having good geological
success.
We're very – I'm very optimistic on the pre-salt stretch across that region. Our Completions business is exceptionally
strong. The Drilling business is strong. It's a nice mix of both, NOCs as well as IOCs and even some European
independents.
So, I'm very optimistic on that part of it – and I would say all Africa, while East Africa was certainly a story in 2012
and 2013 and will be into 2014, I think West Africa will be more of a story in 2014 and 2015.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Well, congratulations. That's a nice turnaround. My follow-up is with Mexico. You
mentioned the Soledad project in Mexico. With the recent change in the Mexican constitution, there's some thought that
while the mega tenders have supposedly been opened and awarded, the actual implementation may be delayed because
it may not be Pemex, who's running that field in a couple of quarters. Can you give us – has the outlook on Mexican
activity for the industry and for Baker Hughes changed with the change in the constitution?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I don't think the activity plans have changed, Jim. I think it's a very good question. It's
not one I know that anybody right now can answer and it's because I think what's changed is the uncertainty has gotten
greater.
And you're right, there is definitely an appetite, I think, on the side of our customer down there to decide what exactly
they want to fund and what they don't. Obviously, you don't want to fund something if you're not going to be getting its
cash flows.
So, there's a high degree of uncertainty. We're trying to figure it out. We've liked the projects that were recently
tendered. We bid what we felt was an appropriate number. We were unsuccessful. I'm disappointed we were
unsuccessful but I'm not disappointed in how we tendered it. These are still lump sum turnkey contracts and albeit Iraq
or Mexico and some of these places, there's a lot of risks associated with – on the service company side.
So, I think we've tried to be a bit more prudent and with a measured appetite of how to go after these, again, as you
kind of highlight within the context of the uncertainty right there.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Perfect. Thank you, Martin.

Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Hi, good morning. I was curious about your guidance, you were talking about North America
margins for first quarter. Sounds like you're guiding to around 10% margins. Just thinking, as you think about 2014 in
your base case. How do you think about margin expansion through year-end? I'm particularly interested in kind of how
much margin can – you're thinking about in terms of increased 24-hour work. I was wondering if you could talk about
that a little bit.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, Dave. This is Martin. Well, look, I could come at that a variety of ways. Let me
say this, that our 24-hour work in the fourth quarter did contribute to the margin, albeit small expansion in the Pressure
Pumping product line and it will continue to. Today, we sit at around 55% and I expect to get somewhere into 70% by

the end of next year, which I think it will probably stay at.
If you couple the incremental gains in Pressure Pumping that we expect, a strengthening Gulf of Mexico outlook,
particularly around the stimulation and completions in the second half of the year, and a general increase in well
counts, and there is some debate out there, but we put it at around, what, around 5% or so?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: 5%.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And a growing appetite for technology because our customers, I think, are going to
squeeze about the last drops out of the efficiency curve that they're going to get, and it's going to be about making
better wells. I fully expect that we can get to the mid-teens by the second half of the year.
<Q - David Anderson>: So, in that 5% forecast of the well count, I was curious how much of that you think is
attributed to pad drilling? I guess I'm just curious from your standpoint, you just look at the Eagle Ford and Permian –
sorry, the Eagle Ford...
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Right.
<Q - David Anderson>: ...and Bakken. How much of that work right now do you think is on pad drilling today, and
where do you think that kind of trends throughout the year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay. So, in 2012, half of the – sorry. In 2012 and 2013, about half the wells drilled were
horizontal. In 2012, 40% of those were from a pad based on our calculations and estimates. In 2013, it went up 50% to
60% of the horizontal wells were on pads. Now, you can't keep going up 50% every year.
<Q - David Anderson>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: So, I think, on a multiple of fronts, I don't care if it's the drilling, the completions, the pad
drilling, this efficiency curve is – I think it's flat-lining, or at least for our customers, so I would say we'll probably –
and you're not going to get every horizontal well off of a pad. So, if we sit at 60% today, let's say next year we may get
to 80%, and I don't know how much more you can get past that. Because I think...
<Q - David Anderson>: Yeah, those are industry numbers. Those aren't your numbers, right? Those...
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: They're not.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, that's what we estimate to be the industry. That's right.
<Q - David Anderson>: Great. I'm sorry, Peter one last quick one, just on your – you're talking about the first quarter
numbers for earnings. Can you just help us out where the share account should be? I have it like around $440 million, is
that the right average maybe a little lower?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Well, we bought back 6.3 million shares in Q4. So, you're looking at around $443 million,
something like that as an average for Q1.
<Q - David Anderson>: $443 million for Q1. Okay, thank you very much.

<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: How are you thinking about revenue growth potential in North America this year? There's
several moving part you mentioned a well count in the U.S. which should be up 5%, I assume driven by horizontals.
5% rig count growth from the Gulf and then Canada, but there's also still a bit of pricing headwind onshore. Putting all
those together where should we think about North American revenues coming out for the year? What type of growth
should we expect?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Scott I don't – I'm not going to quantify it at this stage. I prefer not to. But you've touched
on the drivers. It's – and I think some of the drivers actually are missed and that's this technology side. So, we will get
as the previous from Dave, there will be I think an increase in efficiency associated with the pads. So, we're going to
get more revenue on a daily basis and it will again disconnect from the rig count a bit. There will be of course a
strengthening I think Gulf of Mexico. I think Canada was going to be pretty much flat year-on-year. But you're going to
see whether it's the one I talked about today, the Shadow plug. It's sells at a premium and that premium is being tested
upwards, not downwards because of the value that it's providing. Then you got the ProductionWave.
So, the biases on revenue, to me, are all going in the right direction, to the right. We did see some price slippage from
Q3 to Q4 and you pretty much know, what product line that was, but it was small. And frankly, I think it will maybe
even – maybe a little bit more price slippage into Q1 on that one particular product line. But other than that, I think
most of the arrows are going in the right direction.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Could you, at least, say at this point if the outlook for revenue growth in the U.S. eclipsing
that well count growth numbers, is there a high likelihood of that happening?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I would fully expect that to be the case, yes.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay. If I could just turn to international real quick. Can you provide some color on which
countries will be driving that 10% rig count growth number and, again, how do you think your revenues will trend
relative to the rig count growth?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: As we posted pretty consistently, I expect that revenues in every region will outgrow the
rig count. Now, on a country basis, there maybe some decisions made that go against that. But on a regional basis, I
would fully expect that we do better than rig count.
And from an international perspective, I think we could look at it this way, in Latin America it's going to be pretty
much driven around the Andean Belt. It's possible that the southern cone could be a surprise in 2014, a favorable
surprise. It hasn't really materialized so far. Certainly, the Middle East, led by Saudi, I think you'll see us – a pretty
good increase in rig count in Iraq. I'm not so sure, frankly, that I've got much more appetite for some of those type of
contracts that we're on right now. So, I'm not so sure that our revenue there would pace rig count. And the Gulf region
along with Saudi will be strong.
I think Australia has got a pretty strong outlook. I think Indonesia will be flat given the elections. I think places like
Malaysia, Vietnam and even Myanmar are going to have a pretty sharp rig count growth from a percentage standpoint.
And then as I mentioned to Jim earlier, I think West Africa is going to see a pretty strong increase on the rigs, whereas
the East will be relatively flat.
So, revenue is strong in those respective areas, and certainly, I would expect, Iraq notwithstanding, us outpacing rig
count in terms of revenue.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Sounds good. I'll turn it back. Thanks.

think you said mid-teens. I was thinking about how we would progress there because 2Q, I would expect, with the
Canadian break-up, for margins to be down, which would then mean you got a pretty big leap to get to that kind of
range for the second half of the year. Just hoping maybe you could reconcile that a little bit.
And then you said you're going to be getting the mix here from the Gulf of Mexico. Perhaps, you could talk a little bit
about that as well because I know – I think in the prepared comments, you said we saw some mix issues in 4Q and also
some pushback, it sounded like on the additional stim activity you had expected. So, maybe just a little more color on
that will be helpful.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Sure. Sure, Bill. Okay. So, look, we haven't had – let's take the Pressure Pumping
business. We haven't had any help from the market in improving those margins, right. These are all self-help, albeit, we
were starting from maybe a more challenged position and fully expect that we would swim upstream.
But we're going to continue to, because as I said earlier, we still have a lot more opportunity to get in the middle of
fairway, so that's a big part of it, and we don't need the market to help us. It's entirely on us, and we will deliver.
The Gulf of Mexico is – it's got a pretty sharp, up and down and it's turning in the right direction in terms of the rig mix
and the type of work that our customers will be calling out, whether it's stimulation or completions. And, when I say
pretty sharp up and down, I mean it can have really strong incrementals and decrementals, and I expect it to have
incrementals given the way the market's unfolding and back to the efficiencies outside of Pressure Pumping on U.S.
land with the higher well count and an increase in overall activity.
And then overall, Bill, I guess, we're just going to have to be a little bit more efficient on the way we deploy our
resources in North America to get some stronger incrementals than we have in the past. So, yeah, you're right. Q2 go
down because of Canada. But with what we have to do and what we know we're going to do, I'm confident that we'll
get to the mid-teens for the reasons, I just explained.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Great. Well, I appreciate that follow-up. And one more, Peter, just for you. As we think about
1Q, I guess a couple of things. I know you talked about the year-end product sales falling off, we think revenues and
margins down. I was wondering, just Latin America, Middle East specifically, relatively speaking, should be less
impactful, perhaps, on the margin side just given the kind of self-help initiatives you put in place in Latin America,
maybe offsetting some of those product sales.
And I'm just trying to think about with Iraq snapping back, I'm assuming the revenue loss was probably pretty similar
to the overall after-tax loss given very high decrementals on that work. Should that revenue line frankly hold on a little
bit better as we see that Iraq revenue offsetting some of these product sale losses?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah. Let me just talk about the Iraq for a second. We are on all the rigs that we run prior to
the disruption, so that's the good news. Not all of those rigs are operating at full efficiency yet because you can imagine
when you drop rigs quickly, you've got some repair work to do, so we're doing some of that in Q1, so we're not on full
juice revenue yet in Iraq in Q1 but we're almost there.
But I think the better way to think about the Q1 drop off is you know we – international revenues went up about $165
million in Q3 to Q4. I think you can expect us to give most of that back into Q1 because our year-end product sales
were actually probably higher than normal this year. So, that's the overall international outlook and that's – that
includes Iraq coming back. So, quite a big drop off in product sales from Q4 to Q1.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: And that's across the board in the regions. So...
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. Anything Latin America specific that's helpful to you here, the 4Q to 1Q comparison?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Well, I mean, helpful to – I'm just looking at it here. I think you'll see a pretty significant
decline of revenues in Latin America in Q1. And...

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Bill, this is Martin. Peter is right in terms of the revenue but we would expect in Latin
America the margin to hold in there.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Again based on the – in some of the cost control measures that we put in place.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Correct.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And the mix of those revenues while smaller will be better. So, Latin America is as I said
forecast isn't predicated on a whole lot of revenue that doesn't contribute margins. We're not going to do that.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you very much. You've given us a fair amount of color on the first quarter, but it's still a
tricky quarter to model correctly given all the moving parts. You highlighted some of it excluding Iraq. The seasonal
improvement in Canada should compensate for some of the – of the lack of product sales, so that suggests kind of
something in the low $0.80s. Would that be a fair way of thinking about it?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: I think that's pretty much what I said on the guidance that it'd be a little bit up on Q4.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Yes, and they would call that Q4 of $0.80 if you make the adjustments you suggested right?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, pretty much.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. Secondly, we're sort of seeing some signs in the offshore
drilling market that letters of intent particularly in West Africa are taking longer time than the normal to convert from
LOIs to firm contracts and maybe particularly in Nigeria. And I wonder whether you could offer your views on whether
there is anything particular in West Africa this time around which makes approval processes to start contract assuming
that it affects also Completion and Drilling and all the rest of it, compared to what you have seen in other years.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Ole, this is Martin. I'm not – I just got back from there and I left very optimistic in terms
of the way the Nigerian market is unfolding in particular since you highlight that. And...
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Yeah.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I did not hear – I spent a lot of time with our customers and our folks, of course, but I
didn't hear – I mean there's always frustrations, of course, on the multiple fronts like there is in any country. But I'll tell
you the takeaway for Nigeria for me was the emergence of a whole new operator class independents. Nigerian owned
and operated, very straightforward to deal with, independent of the government restrictions with around having a PSC
or all the tendering rules. It reminds me, frankly, of a North American independent mentality, very capital-disciplined,
but ambitious, high-risk curve in terms of growing. And it's very refreshing for the country and some of the best talent
is working for these independent Nigerian companies. And, like a lot of independents, appetite for technology and
talking to us and, I'm sure, our competitors, but getting after it. So I'm not aware of any delays that are unique or
emerging, but they very well could be, but I didn't hear of any, Ole.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Yeah. The conversion delays seem to be more to do with the IOCs and some other projects that -

imminent start-up all the service work would have been also tendered at this point. So I presume you've won your fair

Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob MacKenzie from IBERIA Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Hi, guys. I wanted to hit back on North American margins here for a minute. And I guess I
want to understand a little bit better whether you still think there's no structural difference between yourself and some
of the other peers that are currently at mid-teens to high-teens margins, understand the guidance you gave for the back
half of the year being what it is. But I'd like to hear some more detail on how you think you get there. Is it really the
customer initiatives? What are the moving pieces there to get you there?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I'm kind of tapped out in terms of what I'm going to say on this. Rob, I'm sorry. I
mean, I've gone through it. I don't want to provide any more color. It's through a structural difference, are we all exactly
portfolio line-up toe-to-toe? No. Neither by product line or even geography.
We have some businesses that I wouldn't want to call them an annuity such as chemicals, for example, where we have a
substantial business that I guess you could possibly look at it as one favorably being disconnected from well count and
rig count, that's for sure, probably the most disconnected, but it's also the most predictable and consistent. And it might
give us a bit of a lower margin at the end of the day. So, is that structural? I don't know.
As to the other aspects, I think I've adequately explained how we plan to get there, and I got to leave it there.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: All right. Let me ask it another way. You highlighted the Shadow plug which we're aware
there's at least one other competitive offering out there, but it's something that strikes us as really interesting in addition
to your new lift solutions for U.S. Land. Arguably, those are young, but the uplift from that technology adoption, I
would think, would be a material contributor, wouldn't it?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: It is. It is. The optionality is – we took out of the prepared script the number of
installations, and I wish I could tell you, but I'm not going to. It's one of these things that I just – let me just tell you. It's
in the hundreds. It exceeded my expectation. It's amazing, the ProductionWave installations. And offline, a little bit, we
even installed one in Wytch Farm in the UK, the customer's pulling it over there. And that really wasn't our intention at
this stage. So, it's really taking off.
As to this Shadow plug, let me just really quickly tell you that the other competitor falls well short on two fronts. One
is – probably can't spell nanotechnology. It certainly doesn't have the material science experts and scientists that we do.
And so, there's no other dissolving ball on a plug and perf scenario. Second, they don't have a full-bore opening
capability and that's a big issue. So, we think the value proposition is significant. I can't quantify right now the size of
the plug and perf market.
But what's exciting is we have the full range. So, if there's a customer that just has a bias towards plug and perf, no
problem. We can handle that. And they will sit down and have that conversation, or if it's sliding sleeve or it's OptiPort,
there's no other completion company in North America that has a portfolio and we're just getting started in terms of
changing these technologies and revolutionizing them like we are on artificial lift and plug and perf. So, I'm pretty

exceed the rig count growth in all geographic regions. I think that was internationally. Would you say that also applies
to your 5% well count estimate for North America?

East would be the highest-growing region and I would assume that you have a possibility of replicating the kind of
growth rate in revenues in 2014 that you had in 2013. So, maybe we can start there. Is that a fair assumption on my part
with respect to Middle East, Far East revenue growth year-on-year?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Kurt, this Peter. Yeah, we would expect the Middle East, Asia Pacific region to have the
highest growth in the double-digits in 2014 versus 2013.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: And then when you look at your Russia, Africa, Latin America what would be behind Middle
East, Asia Pac? Which one of those two would come in next?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian would come in behind that, not far behind it. And I would
say Latin America given the Brazil turnover and all that we had a lot of that work in the first half of 2013. That's not
going to repeat in 2014. So, Latin America is actually going to be challenged to match the rig count which I think the
clarification we need to make here because we expect some growth in some of our key markets, but that Brazil Shadow
is going to weigh on 2014 results versus 2013 results.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Right. And then if I heard you correctly Peter, Europe, Russia, Africa, so you think that's going
to be double-digit revenue growth year-on-year 2014 versus 2013?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yes.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, all right. And then in terms of last thing to kind of wrap up here, in terms of margin
improvement year-on-year in the international region, where would you expect to have the highest or the best margin
improvement and where would you think would be relatively the least?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: In terms of overall OP dollars I think they'll be spread pretty evenly. We've taken a lot of cost
out of each region and I don't think there's anyone that stands out above the others in terms of OP dollar progression,
between 2013 and 2014. They all should be up a decent amount.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: And when you look at – I guess when you look at operating margin percentage. In Latin America
8% in 2013. I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether or not Latin America which showed the highest relative
margin percentage improvement year-on-year, vis-à-vis, the other two regions.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yes, it would. From my perspective, yes, it would.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: All right. That's fine. Appreciate the time. Thank you.
