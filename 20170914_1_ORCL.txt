Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance
for Q2 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can see, we had another good quarter. Customer adoption of our cloud products and services continue to be
very, very strong and our on-premise business remains very resilient. The result was that total revenue was at the high
end of my guidance and earnings per share beat my guidance by $0.01.
Today, I'm going to do what I always do, which is use constant dollar growth rates on this call so we can have some
measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. The effects of currency
movements in Q1 were a little better than expected with 1% tailwind to total revenue. Total cloud and software revenue
were $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency and 9% in U.S. dollars. GAAP applications total revenue were $2.6
billion, up 17% and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenue were $4.7 billion, up 3%. Cloud SaaS revenue for
the quarter were $1.1 billion up 61% from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up
28% from last year.
As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for
SaaS in the quarter was 67%, up from 59% last Q1. We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018 and remain
committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins possibly, as soon as sometime in FY 2019.
The gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 44%, down 58% – down from 58% last quarter as our geographic buildout
goes forward in response to demand, but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect
to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margin.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 51% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were
$5.9 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the
stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. Hardware revenues were $943 million, down 6% and services
revenue were $860 million, up 5%.
Total revenue for the company were $9.2 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion,
up 10% from last year. And it's been a while since we last reported double-digit operating income growth as we
undertook the cloud transformation that affected our income statement, trading upfront revenue recognition of
on-premise license revenue for recurring subscription cloud revenue.
With cloud now in larger and more predictable share of the revenue mix, I expect that we'll see additional strong
operating income growth. The operating margin was 41%, which was up from 39% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate
for the quarter was at 25%, which was over a point higher than my guidance, negatively impacting EPS by $0.01 or so,
and EPS still up 12% in USD and 11% in CD to $0.62.
The GAAP tax rate was 14.5% and GAAP EPS was up 19% to $0.52 in U.S. dollars. Operating cash flow over the last
four quarters was $14.8 billion, up 8% and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.6 billion. Capital
expenditures for the quarter were $473 million. I expect the cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth
and the PaaS IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher-than-expected ARR growth, we'd
expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.
We now have nearly $67 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of our debt our cash position is about $13.6
billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.3 billion, up 9% in U.S. dollars.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic
acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares
for a total of nearly $500 million. We're currently planning on bringing that rate up significantly for Q2.
Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 46.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion, and we also paid out dividends
of $2.8 billion. The Oracle board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.

Now to the guidance, and I'm going to give you guidance for Q2, and my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in
constant currency. However, there has been some currency movement. And assuming current exchange rates remain
the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue and $0.02 positive on EPS.
So here we go, Q2. Cloud revenues – remember, these are constant currency numbers, so you're going to be adjusting
them for U.S dollars. Cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS, are expected to grow 39% to 43%. Total revenue
growth is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere
between $0.64 and $0.68,
up from $0.61 last Q2. That puts the USD number in the range between $0.66 and $0.70 at today's exchange rate. This
assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere between 23.5% and 25.5%. Of course, as usual, the tax rate could end up
being different as it was this quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.
Mark V. Hurd
Thanks, Safra.
It was a strong quarter for Oracle across virtually every metric that we track. In USD, total revenue was up 7%,
operating income was up 11%, EPS up 12%. In cloud bookings, it was a strong quarter. Overall growth was above
40%. That was an acceleration from our growth rate last year. By the way, all numbers are in CD unless I say
otherwise. Cloud revenue up 51%, now at a $6 billion annual run rate. 80% of our TTM, trailing 12-month software
and cloud revenue, is now recurring.
Now I'm going to give you some SaaS revenue numbers by pillar. We are up 61%, as Safra said, accelerating from 55%
growth last year. ERP was up 90% organically. Overall, ERP is now over $1.3 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM
up 109%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. CX [Customer Experience], all of our categories, sales,
marketing, and service were up double digits organically. Data-as-a-service was up 53%, the business now over $0.5
billion annualized run rate.
Our verticals were up 20%, on a compare, by the way, of 115% growth last year. And as good as all these SaaS
numbers are, our application ecosystem, and let me go through again what that is. That's our on-premise license,
on-premise support and SaaS, was together up 17%. When you look at any industry growth metric of the application to
industry, you'll find numbers like one, two, three in the marketplace. The market share gains we have are astounding.
In PaaS infrastructure, our revenue was up 28%. Business Analytics were up 130%, data integration up 221%. Our
database ecosystem, including the same metrics I described earlier, Database-as-a-Service, on-premise support,
on-premise license, was up 3% in USD, in line with industry market growth. Storage and compute industry as a service
were both up triple digits. Cloud deferred revenue was up 53%. So as I described, it was a solid quarter for us with top
line growth of 7% USD in revenue and 12% EPS growth in USD.
A couple of predictions, I expect Q2 cloud booking growth to be strong or stronger than our Q1 growth rate. Our cloud
bookings, we're executing well on a very big and growing pipeline. We expect the cloud FY 2018 full-year cloud
booking growth to be quite strong. Revenue growth now at an annualized rate of $6 billion, or a growth rate of 51%,
and we are the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
I do want to read off to you a few logos of wins we had in the quarter just to give you some context for some of the
companies that we're selling product to, and I'll just mention a few. But in HCM, this is HCM Cloud SaaS, 7nEleven,
Aon, Aris Group, Baptist Health of South Florida, Cantor Fitzgerald, China State Construction Engineering
Corporation, Cook County, Diebold, Habitat for Humanity, Liberty Mutual Insurance, State of Nebraska,
SUPERVALU, the Southern Company, an unnamed large financial services firm in New York. That's also different
from the large unnamed financial services firm we sold to in Q4.

Thank you, Mark.
On October 1 at Oracle OpenWorld, we'll announce the next generation of the Oracle database. When we deliver it by
the end of this calendar year, Oracle will become the world's first fully autonomous database.
Based on machine learning, this new version of Oracle is totally automated, a self-driving system, that does not require
human beings either to manage the database or tune the database. Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources
of human error, enables Oracle to deliver unprecedented reliability in the cloud. We will be offering public cloud SLA,
service level agreements, for the Oracle database that guarantee 99.995% systems availability time. 99.995%
availability means less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year.
To achieve that level of reliability, Oracle has to automatically tune, patch and upgrade itself while the system is
running. AWS can't do any of the stuff. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of autonomous systems, like
self-driving cars and our new self-driving database, are the economics that surround total automation.
Self-driving cars eliminate the labor cost of driving, plus the high cost associated with human driving errors.
Self-driving database eliminates the labor cost of tuning, managing and upgrading the database, thus avoiding all of the
costly downtime associated with human error.
Self-driving taxis are much cheaper to operate than taxis with human drivers. Running Oracle's autonomous database is
much, much cheaper than running traditional human-driven databases like Amazon's Redshift. Customers moving from
Amazon's Redshift to Oracle's autonomous database can expect to cut their costs in half or more, and Oracle will be
providing SLAs that guarantee those cost savings to customers that move.

Thank you, Larry. Holly, we can now queue up the group for the Q&A portion of the call.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Sarah Hindlian, Macquarie.
<Q - Sarah Hindlian>: All right. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the
quarter. The on-premise business is definitely doing better, but we're also seeing and hearing more about very large
marquee customer wins across your cloud portfolio. And now your app business is actually growing 17% constant
currency, which implies you're taking market share. So I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of momentum in that
cloud portfolio, and where you see that heading, and if there's really any benefit coming in from these large reference
customers?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Sure. Yeah. First of all, one thing you said about implying we're taking market share. I just
want to make sure it's clear. We are, and that's why I've been trying to give this number over a longer period of time
that the apps marketplace is growing low single digits, and obviously, we've been doing this for a long period of time in
terms of growing at this rate. But there's no question, to your point, that when you can come out with references, like

we have publicly with Bank of America, AT&T and others, it makes the next opportunity easy when you can reference
customers at that level.
So I think, again, and we said this before, but it probably bears saying again that, just sort of every aspect of selling in
the cloud, I think the company holistically is getting better at. We're better, our products are better, our sales force is
better, our ability to implement is better, our ability to do all of these things has just continued to improve quarter by
quarter by quarter, and it manifests itself in the type of results we're talking about this afternoon.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah. I'll just add. If you look at the growth rate of our applications business in the cloud,
in excess of 60%. And you compare that to either Workday or Salesforce, the two other major players, applications
players in the cloud, they're not even close. So we're much bigger than Workday in applications, and we're growing
faster, must be taking share. And they're our primary competitor in both HCM and ERP. Salesforce has been at it for
15, 16, 17, 18 years. They've been at it for a very, very long time, but we sell more new applications customers than
they do every year. In fact, let me be clear. We sell double, double what Salesforce sells in absolute dollars. We did it
last year and we'll do more than that this year, and we're growing – and we're catching them very, very fast. So, to just
reinforce what Mark said, we are taking share. We're taking share across the entire applications ecosystem, and we're
taking share from our cloud – primary cloud customers as well – our cloud competitors as well.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Sorry, just to add – sorry to elongate the answer, but we're going to talk more about this at
Financial Analyst Day after Oracle OpenWorld concludes. But again, our support business and applications, when we
do move a customer from our support business to our cloud business, we've now done several of these and we get
materially more revenue. We've talked about this before, but it bears saying again, because we've sort of stopped
talking about it, we get at least three times more revenue on a like-for-like basis when a customer moves from
on-premise support to our cloud. And we've really just, just begun to move that user base, most of what's in our
application cloud growth that Larry just talked about is new logos.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan, Bank of America.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Hi, congratulations. One question for Mark and maybe one for Safra. Mark, can you talk about
the – the new disclosure that came out, 8-K, you talked about some really ambitious plans for your SaaS business at
$10 billion in revenue, PaaS and IaaS at $10 billion as well, can you talk about what kind of timeframe are you likely to
achieve this? And how much of this is from acquisitions versus organic? And question for you, Safra. If you are able to
achieve these ambitious targets laid out, how should we think about the margin structure of the company? That's it for
me. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Kash, let me just jump in here and say that we also have an $80 a share stock price target
as part of the comp plan. We also have a target that says we'll be double the market cap of IBM, double the market cap
of SAP. I mean, there are a lot of targets here. In terms of margin, we have a cloud margin target that, I think, is 80%.
So actually, we're well on our way to achieving in SaaS, our SaaS cloud margin target. So we expect the margins in our
businesses to go up, the stock price to go up, for us to distance ourselves from, if you will, our legacy competitors and
join the ranks of the new generation of tech companies, like as Microsoft has done and smaller companies, like
Salesforce and Workday, that's where we position ourselves.
So we think these are stretch targets and it will take several years to achieve them, but we think we are well on our way.
We obviously believe they are achievable, but it will require sustaining the kind of performance we've delivered over
the last several quarters.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: And acquisitions, Larry, in this forecast, are they material or is it all organic?

<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I would love – who would you – there's no one left to buy. It's not like there are a lot of
obvious – as we focus on the cloud, there aren't a bunch of obvious targets we can go out and buy. So we're seeing our
best growth in technology that we've developed internally. Our Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, which is the mid-market and
the high-end of ERP and midmarket and high-end of HCM, these are all internally developed systems. HCM and ERP,
I think our blended rate is growing triple digits. The size of these markets are enormous and we think we'll be able to
ride that horse, pursue that organic growth and meet our target.
So I think it's going to primarily come from internally developed technologies, the growth of those technologies and us
gaining dramatic amounts of share in applications in the cloud and with our new autonomous database, also in
Platform-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service, we have to have all cylinders firing, but the bulk of our
technologies that will determine our success, things like our database and our Fusion application suite, all organically
internally developed.
Operator
And our next question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Brad Alan Zelnick>: Great, thanks very much and really nice quarter, guys, especially for a Q1. I've got a
question for Mark and a quick follow-up for Safra. Mark, the apps ecosystem is off to a really strong start with 17%
growth in the quarter. But with comps getting tougher in the back half of the year as you lap NetSuite, do you still feel
that the apps ecosystem can achieve your double-digit growth goal for the full year?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yes. Yes, I think that I said this. I think towards the end of last fiscal year that I believe we
grow roughly double digits in our applications ecosystem, and this Q1 did nothing more than reinforce my belief. This
is what we – as good as it was, it's what we felt would happen and I believe you will see that for the full year. Our
pipeline shows it; everything else we've got shows it, this will happen.
<Q - Brad Alan Zelnick>: Great, thanks. And just for Safra. Safra, mapping cloud ARR to revenue has been fairly
straightforward for SaaS, but less so for PaaS and IaaS. Is there any color you can give us just to help understand the
revenue trajectory for PaaS and IaaS? Thanks very much.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: We're actually holding over 10 more points on the PaaS/IaaS right now because we've had a lot
of orders and we are deploying them, and we'll only start recognizing them as they deploy. First of all, all of our cloud
customer, a very large amount of it hasn't been fully out deployed. So you're going to start seeing these match up a lot
more as we go ahead and deploy and get those up and running and live. I don't know, Mark, do you want to add
anything?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: It's exactly right what Safra said. We just – I have good news. The good news is we have a large
unprovisioned backlog. And so we will get that provisioned and you will start to see that fold into our Q2 and Q3
numbers as we get that provisioned. So the good news is we've just got a lot of PaaS to go provision. I wish we got it
all provisioned in Q1, but we didn't. So that's really the work that's got to get done.
<Q - Brad Alan Zelnick>: Great.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thanks, Brad.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson.
<Q - Adam Holt>: Hi, everyone. It's good to be back on an Oracle call and to see you all executing so well. My
question is on the cloud business and how that relates to the strengths on-premise. You were obviously very strong in

both applications and infrastructure on-premise in the quarter. Do you think that the hardening of your cloud
infrastructure and the strength in your cloud applications business is actually starting to have a positive impact on
on-premise revenue? And how do you think that dynamic plays out going forward?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: The applications business and the cloud business, our applications business and the tech
business transitions from on-prem to cloud are very different. As we move our application customers from on-prem to
cloud, we're asking them to migrate from the E-Business Suite to Fusion. As they move from our HR, we're asking
them to migrate from Oracle HR or PeopleSoft HR to Fusion HR in the cloud. So they're really changing applications.
In the case of our technology business, where you're running the Oracle database on-prem, we're just asking you to lift
and move your data into our cloud. There really is no technology transition at all. So you really can't look at these
transitions as being similar things. The interesting thing, and it's very different than, let's say, Microsoft. Microsoft,
they took their existing Microsoft Office customers and moved them to the cloud. So suddenly you can save documents
in the cloud, Word documents or Excel documents, you move them to the cloud. That's what's meant by Office 365.
That's very close to our database business, where we're just beginning to move them to the cloud. That's just taking
existing applications. Actually, the new version of our database, as I mentioned, is greatly enhanced in the cloud, and
there are real motives to move it from on-prem into the cloud. You have lots and lots of benefits, but it's not a
technology change.
In our apps transition, you actually move to a whole new technology stack. It was like almost moving to a new vendor,
if you will. You move from Oracle E-Business Suite or PeopleSoft Financials or JD Edwards, all of these on-prem
customers that we have, these on-prem business we have, and you move to Fusion Financial. That required a new
implementation, retraining your people, and we did that. But that transition, as Mark just said, is just beginning.
Most of our Fusion ERP customers, our Fusion HCM customers are new logos, and we don't expect when people move
from their database – database from on-prem into cloud, we don't expect support to go away. We expect them just to
bring their licenses into our cloud and you're paying support, you have the license, you own the license. Now you run it
in our cloud and you pay us additionally for running in our cloud, just like if you move our – the Oracle database into
the Amazon cloud, you pay them additionally.
So it is simply lifting up your existing license, therefore you keep paying support, you keep paying support, and you
add onto that Infrastructure-as-a-Service or Platform-as-a-Service fees associated with running it in our cloud. So we
think that's a much easier transition for us than the transition we're making on the apps side of the business. And look
how well the transition on the apps side of the business is going.
<Q - Adam Holt>: Terrific, thank you.
Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore.
<Q - Stewart Kirk Materne III>: Thanks very much and I'll add my congrats on the quarter. Mark, obviously a lot of
momentum in ERP right now. I was wondering when you look at where the market is today, if you think we're getting
closer to more of a tipping point in terms of larger customers setting up to make decisions on moving their ERP
systems to the cloud over the next 12 to 18 months. And when you talk to customers, what are some of the reasons or, I
guess, feedback you're getting that gives you confidence in terms of taking market share in this cycle if we're about to
go into one? Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah. Well, obviously, we're getting a lot of – we have strong growth. We had another
acceleration just in terms of logos. We had acceleration of ERP logos this Q1 versus last Q1, so we had more closures
in terms of numbers of accounts, and we had bigger companies looking. So it's significant to the point of your question.
We also have more modules coming online. So if you look at what we've got in ERP now, we have more localizations
across more geographies, and we now have our full suite of ERP, supply chain, procurement, manufacturing, now

budgeting and planning all available. So it's the full suite now across almost all of our geographies.
To Larry's point, I think it's worth stating a lot of our ERP customers now are new logos. Lots of new financials
customers, and lots of companies that to be very blunt with you, Kirk, we would never have sold to five or six years
ago. Companies that are really names, but when you come to Oracle OpenWorld, you'll see another string of customers
who never had an Oracle application before until they bought Oracle Financials in the cloud. So it's that.
Then, in addition to that, I think what really helps us is the fact that we are the only suite provider. So the fact that now
a company instead of having a bunch of point solutions can have a suite of applications, and the opportunity for us to
now bring HCM and ERP together to a customer gives us an incredible advantage across basically all of our customers.
So you see now in the names I read off to you, lots of what I would call high-end midmarket low-end enterprise
customers that are really the common persona of who we sell to, most of them new logos.
I think you'll see that continue as we go forward. The best news I can give you is that as we start to bring our larger
customers over, Oracle will get materially more revenue as we move that support, because we do everything for them.
We do the hardware, we do the operating system, we do – it's our data center. We do really everything for them, and we
get the extra revenue as a result of that.

Our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Philip Winslow>: Hi. Thanks, guys, and congrats on the great start to the year. I just wanted to focus on the
platform and infrastructure side, in particular. And as you look at the overall numbers, you're still putting up very
healthy growth rates here both, obviously, in the cloud with the PaaS offering, but also on-premise. Mark or Safra,
wondering if you could double-click on just what you're seeing on the on-premise even as PaaS is ramping, that's
keeping that business growing. And a question to Larry, obviously, we're excited to hear about the new features coming
at OpenWorld. But when you think about the Oracle PaaS offering versus other infrastructure-as-a-service plus DBMS
out there, why is it that the Oracle Cloud can lower cost more than these competitors and therefore make it gain share
there?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay, they're pointing to me. I guess they want me to go first. The reason we can lower
cost is we just automate more. There's a big difference between – what Amazon basically does, what they pioneered
was this notion of we will rank you based on what you use on our compute and storage, and you can kind of bring
whatever – and they offer a couple of databases. They offer Aurora, which is MySQL, their version of MySQL, and
they offer Redshift, which is another – their version of an open-source database. They made some changes to it. It's no
longer open source, it's from Amazon for queries and OLTP, but these are technologies that are not automated. These
are, if you will, old-fashioned technologies and a newfangled cloud data center, and available for rental. So it's kind of
an interesting new business model, but their database technologies are not very advanced at all. They just picked them
up under open-source.
Our database, especially the latest generation of our database, totally automates everything. You don't – you push a
button and load your data, and you're done. You don't have lots of tuning parameters, and lots of things to set up like
you do with Amazon. Amazon requires a lot of labor to set up an online transaction processing system based on
Aurora. That's a lot of labor. It's MySQL. It's kind of our – it's code that we maintain. We know it very, very well. Very
different than Oracle. You press a button, load your data and run your analytics. It tunes itself. It backs itself up. It
patches itself. It never goes down and it's much, much, much faster.
I keep saying it's much, much, much faster. And then someone will say well we don't need that speed. Well let me
translate. If it's much, much, much faster and if it does in an hour what Redshift does in 10 hours, it's one-tenth the cost
of running at Amazon because we charge the same amount per hour. So we take out the labor cost, and because we
consume less CPU and we compress the data, and we consume less storage, it's much – we're much more frugal about

using compute and storage resources, and we eliminate the labor costs and the costs associated with human error. So
we're not even trying to do the same thing as Amazon.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: To your other question, Phil, listen I think there's a strong interest across the board. Listen,
we've got obviously new features that come with Release 12. You know about all those with multi-tenant, within
memory, et cetera. Obviously, our security options are very important given the world that we live in today. We have a
desire for many of our customers to get out of all this work, to get out of patching, to look at modernizing their
infrastructure. You may have heard what AT&T talked about. They will also be an Oracle OpenWorld, and you'll hear
a lot more directly from them. But the need to not just consolidate, not just get the new features to modernize those
applications, but to get out of all this work to the point that Larry's describing about. Now the fact that I can't deal with
the amount of time it takes to patch all of these hybrid environments that I've got. Now somebody, i.e., Oracle is going
to do that for me. They're going to modernize the database and they're going to give me all these features, but you have
to take all that work off my shoulders.
So there's a tremendous amount of this. Now to Larry's other point. Remember, most of our customers stick with
somebody like AT&T. They have over 10,000 Oracle databases in that company; 10,000. So you're going to have a
handful of those big ones move to the cloud. There's still going to be quite a few those that stay on-premise for a period
of time. So that work is just a lot of work for us to help, and this is the beginning of a whole string of customers, they're
going to go through this process to modernize their database environments.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.

Our next question will come from the line of John DiFucci, Jefferies.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Thank you. Thanks. I have – Safra, I've a quick – just a very quick question on the guidance, and
if I could ask another question. Just a clarification. You said total revenue could see I think a 3% benefit on top of the
2% to 4% guidance you gave for total revenue, right? And I know the math is really here, but I just want to make sure,
that implies, I believe a 5% to 7% reported revenue growth if you get that 3% FX effect? Is that right, am I doing that
math...?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: So, for USD, I'm going to go through the entire thing in USD for you guys. Because you are
not the only note in fact, you are not the only note. You are not the only note. So, I'm going to go through it. For total
cloud, 41% to 45%.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Okay.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: It really comes out like 4.5% to 6.5% but I'm going to say 4% to 6% in total revenue. And then
EPS $0.66 to $0.70 making EPS growth somewhere between 7% and 13%. Okay? So that can help.
<Q - John DiFucci>: That's very helpful, but I'm the only note you need to read. But that's okay.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: They're all like, could you do it for me?
<Q - John DiFucci>: Only, but just kidding.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: And it's a fair question, because there are a bunch of rounding, 5% to 7%, 4% to 6%, it's
somewhere in the middle there. So I'm always being conservative, so I'll say 4% to 6% on this call for you, but you
know me. Okay. Was there another question was somebody else...
<Q - John DiFucci>: Yeah. Just a quick one. It's great to see the model work in the SaaS business with scale driving
leverage here. And I know you say we're also going to get leverage in the PaaS and infrastructure-as-a-service business
at scale. Again, I know there's a lot of variables here, but can you help us when we're looking out of when we might see
this happen? When we might see this turn, either the timing next year or the year after, or even the scale when the

business hits approximately what scale?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay. So it's a little bit complicated because there is a mix between IaaS and PaaS. PaaS in
particular, extremely, extremely, extremely profitable and, however, there's really a question of when the revenues get
recognized and how much investing I have to do and how we lined those up. So we are, just like you saw in SaaS, I
know that at the time it seemed absolutely impossible that we would have the kind of margins we now have in SaaS. It
seemed impossible, and yet they came. And now we're closing in on 80%, so much so that I actually went ahead and
gave you sometime next year for that hitting.
PaaS and IaaS are very much, at least at this point, in the expansion period. We expect this to be a very large business,
though we remain very conscious of the margins. And so we're trying not to invest too much ahead of revenue
recognition, but as you see, in this quarter alone, we have a lot that has yet to be deployed, fully deployed, even though
it's fully provisioned, even though the equipment is all bought and being capitalized. So this is really – I can't give you
an exact time because we're going to be very much monitoring demand and reacting to that. And for us, it's much more
important that we expand quickly, of course, mindful of margin dollars, sometimes not as mindful necessarily of any
inter-quarter margin percentages. So I don't know if you want to add anything
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Listen, I think, John, there's no mystery to this, right? This is just like the SaaS business. You
have to build out some initial infrastructure to get started. You have to build it, and unfortunately, you have to put it
online before you can sell it, and that's what this is. There is a startup cost to getting into these businesses. We're past
that in SaaS. We're deployed now in virtually all of the critical geographies, and we now have scale in most of the
critical geographies. And so you see it just show up in the margin rate as it has.
We're going through that same process in infrastructure. The great news for us, we know how this works. We know
how to get it done. We know how to measure it. We know how to get from here to there, and so you'll see the same
results. And so it's just a factor of time, scale, and bookings, and to Safra's last point, the ability then for us to get it
provisioned so we can then recognize the revenue. So this is going to happen, John.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Okay, thank you. That all makes sense, but should we expect that we might need more scale?
Would it develop similarly to how SaaS did, or would we expect to hit certain margins, we'd have to get even greater
scale in this business?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: No, I don't think there's any material difference in the context of scale. There's the same
fundamentals, that's what I'm trying to go through.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Got it.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: You've got a startup cost. You've got to get a data center. You've got unused capacity to get
started, and then the increments of capacity to bookings comes at a very attractive margin rate. So think of it as you
have a baseline of X, and then I get a booking, and then I have a little bit of capacity per booking, so to speak. It's not
exactly how it works but for the sake of your analytics at how it works, and we know what that increment of capacity is
for that booking. And then it's just a question of scale from there. So you take the unused piece, and then for each
booking, you get so few – a couple of few cents on the dollar that you have to add for incremental capacity, and it just
becomes the time it takes to get to scale. That's it.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Great, that's very helpful. Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Sure.

how you see this whole thing evolving? Because there's obviously a lot of noise, a lot of hype around it. Some of the
other competitors of yours come up with fancy names here. How do you guys see this play out for you guys? Thank
you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: We're using machine learning all over the place. Everything from at the very highest level
to in our HR systems, our recruiting systems, to look at a bunch of candidates and inspect the data of people that this
company has hired that have been very successful and people who have been less successful, so we can actually start to
bucket the candidates. This group, you've got 200 people you're looking at hiring, and the 50 over here look very much
like the 50 people that you hired over the last five years that have been enormously successful for the company. And
that's a matter of using machine learning to just look at the profiles of individuals a company has hired over a period of
time and make recommendations on how to prioritize candidates that they're looking at making offers to.
All the way from that level to our new security systems which are going in now, where we're doing log inspection,
where we're looking at people. And the logs we look at, unlike anybody else, we are in the applications business we are
in the database business, and we're in the cloud infrastructure business looking at network, network logs and operating
system logs, and storage hardware logs. We're also looking at database logs.
We're looking at people trying to log on to application systems and the passwords they're using. We have all of these
logs and we're processing all of these logs in our cloud to, for example, looking – trying to find people who are going to
attack a database and steal passwords and steal data. And we think we do this better than anybody because we look at
more data. We look at application data. In other words, we suddenly notice that your CFO is in the Ukraine trying to
log on 50,000 times in the middle of the night. Maybe your CFO is not vacationing in the Ukraine and that's not her,
and there could be a problem and someone's trying to break in.
We look at that level of data all the way down to IP addresses, that are strange IP addresses trying to figure out – again,
we look at strange SQL tapes. Anyway, we do much – we look at 10 times more log information than someone like a
Splunk who is inspecting IP addresses, but not login information. So we get a much better picture of all the activity of
what's going on inside your data center, and use machine learning to inspect this vast amount of data, and see if
someone's in the reconnaissance phase prior to an attack where we can shut them off while they're looking around
before they actually attack anything and start stealing passwords and start stealing data. Again, that's also all machine
learning.
We're offering that technology again in OpenWorld. We're offering – the customers can ship their logs from their data
center into our cloud and we'll do all of that; security, reconnaissance and the security work for them. And the more of
this information we have the better equipped we are to find malware. You find malware showing up in let's say
Germany, and we know what it looks like and suddenly we have worldwide alerts because – worldwide alerts that – to
recognize that malware that should show up in California or at a – and as we know, there's a lot of – security is getting
more and more important these days. The events at Equifax, very unfortunate events at Equifax is not going to be an
isolated incident. You're going to see more and more things like this. You saw it at the Government's Office of
Personnel Management which was disastrous for our intelligence community.
We've got to do a better job. We've got to do a better job of securing not only our cloud but our customers' data centers,
getting all of that log data, using machine learning to – and basically what is a cyber war that's going to be ongoing for
a long, long time. So everything from helping companies using AI to help companies hire the right people to helping
data centers, both private data centers and public data centers protect against intrusions. It's an important new
technology and it's the center of what we're doing with database automation, security and our applications.
