MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caterpillar Full Year and 4Q 2015 Results Conference Call.
At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and
comments after the presentation.
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael Lynn DeWalt
Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Year End Earnings Call. I'm Mike DeWalt,
Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services. On the call with me this morning we have Doug Oberhelman, our
Chairman and CEO; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO. Now this morning we're going to do the call
similar to what we did last October. We'll be going through a short slide deck before we get to the Q&A. And if you
don't have it yet, the slide deck, it's available on our website at, caterpillar.com, and it's with the Conference Call
Webcast link.
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call is strictly
prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting that in the Investor section of our
caterpillar.com website and it'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning we'll be discussing forward-looking information that certainly involves risks and uncertainties and
assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of
some of those factors, individually or in the aggregate, that could make actual results differ materially from our
projections, that can be found in our Cautionary Statements under item 1A, which is Risk Factors, and our 10-K filed
last February and it's in the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release and near the front of this
morning's slide deck. In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in today's financial release
and, again, that's been posted on our website at, caterpillar.com.

Okay, with that, let's get started. If I could ask you to pull out the slide deck and flip to page three, and that's the agenda
of our slide deck. I'll start this morning with a quick review of the fourth quarter and the full year of 2015 and the
outlook for 2016. And then I'll hand off to Doug and he'll cover a few of the key points that we were trying to make in
this morning's financial release.
So with that, let's flip to what would be page four, at the bottom of the slide deck. And this is the fourth quarter 2015
results versus fourth quarter 2004. And you can see on here that sales and revenues are down $3.2 billion, from $14.2
billion to $11 billion, that's a 23% drop. And I'll kind of talk about that two ways. First, about $2.7 billion of that was
lower volume, selling fewer things, and most of that was lower end-user demand. About $400 million of it was related
to reductions in dealer inventory. Price realization was negative in the quarter, about $124 million. And we did have a
stronger dollar versus the fourth quarter of 2014, which causes our sales outside the U.S. to translate into fewer dollars
and, in this case, quarter-over-quarter a negative of about $400 million. So that's the $3.2 billion.
If you look at that by segment, the biggest decline was energy and transportation and it was off $1.8 billion. About $0.8
billion of that was CI, construction, and about half of that – a little more than half of that was where the dealer
inventory impact was most concentrated. And then about $0.5 billion was resource industries and, again, that's mostly
mining. So the decline was across the board, but a bit more concentrated quarter-over-quarter in energy and
transportation. And I think given what's happened to oil prices over the course of the past year, that's probably not a big
surprise.
Now the profit impact of those changes or of that decline in sales volume was about $940 million negative. The next
largest item quarter-over-quarter is restructuring costs, and they were negative $585 million. They went from $97
million in the fourth quarter a year ago to $682 million this year. And a lot of that increase is a result of the fairly
significant actions that we announced last September and are in the middle of implementing right now.
Costs, though, were favorable, about $461 million. And that's pretty much all-in, excluding restructuring, versus a year
ago, so that's good news. Now taxes, I know it's probably a little hard to follow what's happening with taxes. It was a
very low, kind of all-in tax impact in both quarters. The rate this year is a little lower than last year and we had $85
million of favorable tax items in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. So a little bit
hard to follow, but not a massive impact quarter-over-quarter.
If we look at the profit numbers on the table up above, all-in profit in the fourth quarter a year ago was $1.23. We
actually had a loss of $0.15 in the fourth quarter of 2015, and a lot of that was because of the significant restructuring
costs. So the all-in change was a decline of $1.38 a share. Excluding the restructuring costs, in 2014 the fourth quarter
was $1.35, the fourth quarter 2015 was $0.74, and we were down $0.61. We continue to report our results both with
and without restructuring costs. We think it's important to help you understand what's going on in the business. So
that's the fourth quarter.
Let's flip to page five. That's the full year. It was obviously a tough year for us in 2015. Sales were off $8.2 billion. The
vast majority of that was lower sales volume, but the stronger dollar impacted the full year in kind of the same way it
did the quarter.
In terms of segments, Energy and Transportation was the largest decliner at $3.8 billion. That was oil, rail, electric
power, so fairly widespread within E&T. Construction Industries was down $2.8 billion, and Resource Industries, $1.4
billion. So from a profit standpoint, all-in we were $5.88 in 2014.
All-in, including restructuring, we dropped to $3.50 in 2015 and that's a decline of $2.38 a share. More than all of that
is the decline in volume. If you take out restructuring costs, we were $6.38 in 2014, and $4.64 in 2015, down $1.74.
And I think the story for 2015 is big sales headwind, $8.2 billion, but we worked really hard on lowering cost, we took
significant restructuring actions and new restructuring actions began in the third quarter. Our costs were about $520
million favorable and that's net of about $350 million of unfavorable cost absorption. So let me explain that a little bit.
In 2014, sales were pretty flat with 2013. Not a big change. So inventory didn't change much, it was down $400 million
in 2014, so inventory absorption wasn't a big deal in 2014. In 2015, inventory declined $2.5 billion, so that's $2.1

billion more than it did in 2015. And there's a pretty significant cost impact to that sizable a decline in inventory, order
of magnitude $350 million. And so without that, cost would have been even more favorable.
Share count was positive to profit year-over-year, about $0.16 a share. And a lot of that is the full-year impact of the
significant repurchases we did in 2014 and a partial year impact of the repurchases that we did in 2015. Overall bottom
line, all-in on tax, not much change year-over-year. So that's the full year. And if you take out the restructuring costs, I
would just mention that our decremental operating profit margins were about 20% and we would consider that to be
pretty good performance. It's better than our 25% to 30% target.
So let's flip to the next page, page six. Now, page six is a little discussion on how we did versus our outlook. And in
this case, since so much transpired over the year, we're kind of taking a long look back. How did we do versus what we
told you we thought we would do a year ago right now in our year end call for 2014? And then how did we come out
versus the outlook that we had in place at the end of October, the last conference call that we had the third quarter
financial release?
And so if you look down the numbers, in January a year ago we were expecting sales and revenues this year to be $50
billion, profit per share to be $4.60, restructuring costs to be only another $150 million and then profit per share
excluding those restructuring costs to be around $4.75.
Now, what we actually had was sales and revenues that were $47 billion, and that's in the third column, which were $3
billion below where we thought they would be when we started the year. And I think everything that's happened with
oil prices, commodities in general, increased weakness in China, most of the sales decline that we actually had in 2015,
we'd anticipated in that outlook. We were down from that about $3 billion.
Profit per share is lower by $1.10. And quite a bit of that is restructuring costs were a lot higher and, again, that's
because we announced pretty substantial new actions in September. So excluding restructuring costs, we were at $4.64,
and that's $0.11 a share shy of where our outlook was when we started the year. And I think our view would be on a $3
billion sales decline, even given all the puts and takes, that's pretty good performance.
Now versus the last outlook that we provided in late October of 2015, we said our outlook was going to be about $48
billion, and we kind of clarified that a little further as somewhere in the range of $47 billion and $48 billion. We were
looking at profit per share of $3.70, and that included $800 million of restructuring costs. And then excluding
restructuring, we were looking at $4.60.
Well what we actually did was a little worse on sales. It's been a continuing challenging environment. Profit per share
was lower and that's largely because we had more restructuring cost than we expected at the time. Excluding
restructuring, we ended up the year at $4.64, actually a little ahead of our outlook. Now, I've seen a few of this
morning's analyst reports and for sure we did not have the tax extenders in our previous outlook, so that was an
unanticipated benefit for us, and several analyst reports I think have picked that up.
The flipside of that is we also had a fairly sizable charge for a legal matter in our fourth quarter. We didn't expect that
either and it really wasn't related to operations, if you will, in the quarter, and those two items about offset each other.
So I would say all-in, despite lower sales, we did a little bit better than our outlook and we're pretty pleased with that.
So let's talk about 2016. A lot going on in 2016, so let's flip to page seven. First we'll do sales and revenues. It looks to
us like another tough year. We're not forecasting any real improvement in the overall world economy, we're not
banking on commodities getting better and, as a result of that, we're looking at $40 billion to $44 billion in sales and
revenues. A midpoint there is about $42 billion.
Now that is about $3.5 billion below where we were thinking last October when we gave a preliminary outlook. And I
think that's probably not too surprising to most of you with the continued slide in oil prices to down around [ph] $30 a
share. (14:43) And I would say continuing concern and worry around emerging markets, particularly China.
So as we look at next year and what we think will happen with sales or what we're expecting, another down year for
Energy and Transportation, down 10% to 15%. Now quite a bit of that decline is around timing. So we knew oil prices
were coming down last year. We expected that to weaken pretty substantially in 2014, and it did. But most of that

reduction was in the second half of the year. We started 2014 with a pretty sizable backlog and we sold out of the
backlog for the first half of the year in Energy and Transportation, particularly in the reciprocating engines for oil
customers.
So if you looked at Energy and Transportation at their first half of 2015, they were only down 6% versus the prior year.
Second half of the year was down 27%. That is kind of how we thought it would play in. It's what we signaled at the
beginning of the year. Stronger first half, weaker second half, and now we see kind of that level of business continuing
on with the recip oil and gas business out on into 2015.
Construction Industries, we're looking at being being down 5% to 10% and Resource Industries down another 15% to
20%. Now on Resource Industries, the bad news is it looks like it's down another 15% to 20%. That's really a tough
business in mining, very few orders, many of our customers are in challenged financial conditions. But what I would
say is sales of new equipment in that number are quite low. You never want to say never about upside and downside
risk, but there's so little new equipment in there, I think it's fair to say the downside risk is somewhat limited.
In terms of profit per share, we put in a table here. And this is the table that was in our financial release. There's a lot of
moving parts, so I thought it would help to walk through it piece by piece. So if you look at our outlook for 2016, all-in
profit per share, we're looking at $3.50, and that includes restructuring costs and that includes pension changes that we
are making.
We're making a change in accounting principle. It relates to our defined benefit plans primarily. It's positive to our
results about $0.50 per share. And the way you want to think about this is we're moving from an accounting method
that smooths actuarial gains and losses from prior years into current year results. And we're moving from that to a
method that's more mark-to-market and will be a closer representation of what our current-year costs really are, and
that's favorable about $425 million in and of itself and that's about $0.50 a share. We also have another $400 million or
so of restructuring costs in our outlook and that's about $0.50. So all-in, excluding restructuring costs, we're at $4 a
share.
So that's the outlook for 2016 on sales and profit. In terms of profit, the negatives are lower sales as we go into 2016
from $47 billion, down to the midpoint would be $42 billion, so at the midpoint that's a $5 billion profit drop offset by
considerable cost reduction. A lot of that as a result of the restructuring actions that we started to put in place last
September.
So with that, I'll turn the floor over to Doug Oberhelman.
Douglas R. Oberhelman
Okay. Good morning, everyone. And I do want to make a few key points as I look back on 2015, and forward into
2016. Mike said it was a very tough year, but when you think about everything that happened, the challenges, the chaos
at some time during the year with events around the world, a year ago today we were expecting $50 billion in sales. We
ended up at $47 billion. That $3 billion is quite a drop, but we really only reduced our profit per share outside of
restructuring by $0.11. And as Mike said, there's a lot involved in that, up and down.
But basically, I'm pretty pleased with the cost management, the restructuring actions we took in the fourth quarter.
Actually they were more aggressive than we had planned and announced and we took about $100 million more because
of it. But that will suit us up well for 2016. So, our team really did a good job and, it's tough to say, but we're getting
used to cycles here.
2009 volume at $32 billion, we doubled the company in three years in 2012. We're down about 30% from that now.
And that will serve this team very well in the years and decades ahead as having to go through these kind of cycles in
the short dates.
Secondly, operationally 2015 was one of our better years.

One thing, and I've talked about this before, one of the proxies I use for plant management is their safety record. And
when I go to plants, I look at – for that matter, when I go to customers' job sites it's the same thing. But if there's a safe
environment, they tell me about it and their numbers are good, chances are we're going to see high quality, we're going
to see engaged employees and we're going to see a profitable plant. And safety for us hit a record level for recordable
injury frequency in 2015 at 0.6, which is really world class we think for heavy manufacturing.
Our market position, fifth year in a row of improvement around the world and virtually across all markets, for that
matter, and most all products. And I think that goes back to saying something about the quality of our product, the
quality of our design, our Tier 4 implementation, as well as dealer distribution organization, which right now is very
strong.
And then finally, Mike mentioned it, but I would point it out again, our decremental operating profit of 20%. If you
really look at that without restructuring and everything, it's really 17%. And while that, granted, happened in the fourth
quarter, but that's what we wanted to do. So very happy with that, and it again sets us up for 2016 so well.
Our balance sheet is strong. We put some of the data in the release this morning. We saw a lot of free cash flow, about
$5.2 billion in 2015. Another great year. Certainly, we'll see another positive cash flow year this year, more than
enough to cover our dividend and our CapEx. I would say that we are scrubbing CapEx very hard and taking a really
close look at levering every line item. We'll get that number down below 2015 and we're still working through it.
And finally, our focus on use of cash, as you know, has been fairly well stated over the years. But at the moment, it's
our balance sheet, our credit rating and protecting our dividend. And with the cash we have on the balance sheet, with
the leverage we have today, which is the best it's ever been at this stage of a cycle going back to many, many of our
downturns, we feel pretty good about that. But that's really a high priority for us today is to protect that dividend and
that balance sheet.
We did a little conference call in November around Cat Financial. We really like that business. It's strategic to us. We
would not have the market position we have without Cat Financial and the loyalty with our customers. Actually, in
2015, they hit a very high market share number for what they finance. The quality of that asset portfolio is very good,
past dues actually improved a little bit from 2014.
And just to emphasize that we really at Cat Financial only use that captive finance company to finance Caterpillar
product, yellow iron. Or yellow iron inside other products where yellow iron is a big piece of it. We have not varied
from that strategy, we won't vary from that strategy. It is so key and crucial to us in delivering our market performance
around the world and it's a really well-managed company and it's really helping us through the cycles as well.
Looking at 2016, tough market. I would expect bumps in the road all through the year. We've taken that outlook down
to $42 billion, another drop of $5 billion. A little over a 10% reduction, about 30% off our peak in 2012. And I expect
to see, frankly, commodities of all stripes and all kinds and oil, for that matter, not to move too much. It can move up or
down, we'll see what happens, but we're going into this with an eyes-wide-open realistic view that we're going to end
up the year with what we went into with and where we are in commodity markets and other economies as well.
Brazil, Russia, some of the areas where have been really challenged, we're baking into this outlook continued tough
times in a lot of those markets as well. So I am really am hoping that this is a very realistic look. We've got some more
restructuring coming to us that will help. We think we're about right sized for right now. Of course, we've got some
other restructuring that we'll be announcing as early as tomorrow with another round that will fulfill some of the things
we talked about in September.
I also want to talk about inventory a little bit. We think we're pretty close and really not that excessive with inventory
around the world, but we probably will see a slight – some more reduction in dealer inventory. We've actually been
producing at factory rates less than retail sales for a while and we, as a result, seen dealer inventory drop $1 billion and
our own drop $2.5 billion, so we've really seen a drop here in the last year which, again, sets us up nicely into 2016.
Then a little bit more on restructuring, I think we are committed to that pull-through number of 25% to 30%, up or
down. As I said, we're 17% to 20% in 2015. We announced it in September, our goal was 4,000 to 5,000 positions

eliminated by the end of the year. In fact, we were slightly over 5,000 on the 1 of January and with a few more to go
yet early in 2016, should fulfill that program and our cost reduction goals.
Finally, and this is the one that's good news and I feel really good about and I'm going to talk about it for a minute.
That's our efforts around digital technology, innovation and R&D. We increased R&D slightly in 2015. We're going to
hold it at about that level as long as we can in 2016. And I would just point out that we also did something similar to
this in 2009 and 2010 at the depths of the recession. We cut R&D, but we didn't cut it to the bone. That was the one
thing that we held onto as long as we could and those efforts in research and development that we made at that time on
new products have hit the marketplace in our Tier 4 Interim and Final products being introduced, the last of them this
year, and we have seen a substantial increase in the quality of the products, the design of the products and the
acceptance in the marketplace, not to mention fuel economies across the-board.
Today we're in the same boat post-year four with lots of powertrain development, all kinds of alternative propulsion
methods coming through, which will be coming out in products in 2017, 2018 and 2019. We want to continue that
because we've seen the benefits of that in market share, we'll see the benefits of that in the future and we're going to do
all we can to hold that. So while it's a high number and subject to cut if we have to, and we will, we're doing all we can
to preserve that.
And then around the digital technology space, you've seen an awful lot of utterances from us last year, the formation of
a joint venture with a key partner, closer ties with other existing and traditional partners as well. The digital
transformation is occurring in reality and we are going to lead this in our industry.
While it's challenging in our cycle – probably if we had a better cycle, we'd probably spend more, we're doing all we
can to extend our leadership in this area. What we are aiming at is quite a bit different than others. I would say we're
aiming at the Internet of Caterpillar things so that when we think about what we're doing with digital technology, what
we're doing with site preparation and technology, machine guidance technology, machine health technology, it's all
about our installed base of 3 million machines and engines. Rail, construction, mining, the things we do.
We have no interest in going beyond that because we want to take care of our customers as we have been doing for 90
years. We have the domain knowledge of what our customers use our machines to do. We have knowledge of our
machines. Our idea is to make a ready platform, lots of sensors across our machines and other brands to make sure that
our customer gets the most out of that construction equipment in his or her fleet.
I suspect that in the next year or two, five, this will be a tremendous add. We'll be talking a lot more to you about it in
our Investor Meetings and so on as we get there. Just this month, we're commercializing our locomotive Internet
technology. That led all of our segments and it's now ready to go. We're in the middle stages of taking that to
construction equipment. We'll have some of that ready mid-year and a lot of it by the end of the year. But the idea here
is really a lot of value creation for customers, reducing downtime and lowering owning and operating costs by
predicting failures, by allowing them to take less passes across a parking lot, for example, better fuel economies and
efficiencies as a result, all through this overwhelming amount of data that we can now receive, process and feed back to
our customers, our dealers and even our factories in a way that we've never been able to do it before.
We'll we have a lot to say on this. There's been a lot written about it. I'm really happy where we are and our speed to
market on this is un-Caterpillar like in terms of our iron development. I'm quite happy about that. That's why we've
gone to outside partners.
So, Michael, I'll turn it back over to you with those comments.
Michael Lynn DeWalt
All right. Thanks, Doug. Paul, we're ready to open the floor for Q&A.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is
coming from Jerry Revich. Jerry, please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Jerry Revich>: Hi. Good morning, everyone. It's Goldman Sachs. I'm wondering if you could talk about your
expectations for Solar. Just flesh that out for us if you could, Mike, this year and comment on cadence over the course
of the year. Within the past month, we've seen pipeline MLPs cut CapEx and wondering if you could just calibrate us
on what you're seeing in the order book.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yeah, good question, Jerry. Happy to do that. So as usual, as is almost usual, Solar had
a great fourth quarter of 2015. We expected that and, in fact, they did. Backlog for Solar, despite that big shipping
quarter in the fourth quarter, was about the same at year-end as it was at the end of the third quarter. So no deterioration
in their backlog. In fact, if you look at Solar's total backlog, it's about the same as it was at the end of 2014.
What's happened to their business is the oil piece of it has declined quite a bit, the natural gas piece of it is holding up
quite nicely. We'd signaled that we would have some reduction in Solar in the third quarter when we did the
preliminary outlook. We said they would likely decline, but less than 10%, and nothing has really changed there.
<Q - Jerry Revich>: Okay. And then separately, Doug, the last point that you made the Caterpillar Internet of Things,
can you talk about your expectations in five years? Are we looking at a significant revenue and profit pool for your
business? What kind of business model should we be thinking about for you folks to monetize all of the valuable fleet
that you have in the field? And the opportunity to monetize that data, how should we think about the business model?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: It's not going to be a software charge-out system at all. We're going to measure it and
the benefit to us will be in aftermarket parts, aftermarket service and connection to the customer through the products
that we sell and service. And that's really where we're headed as opposed to a software-for-fee basis. Pretty simple and
just as an adjunct to what we're already doing in so many of our areas today with aiming directly at our customers.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Thanks, Jerry.
<Q - Jerry Revich>: Thank you.

Thank you. And your next question is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Robert, please announce your affiliation and
pose your question.
<Q - Robert Wertheimer>: It's Barclays. And good morning, everybody. I guess a dual question on price and cost.
You've had a little bit of lower pricing, although I think under your leadership, Doug, you guys have been very, very
competitive, gained a lot of share and not made your margins with price, so I get that. But you still had a little bit of a
contraction in price, so is there anything major going on with either currency or is it an inventory flush, or what's doing
that? And are you able to continue to get cost back from your suppliers? Are you sort of ahead of the curve there? Or
does that continue to flow through into 2017, the materials moves we've already seen? Thanks.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Hey, Rob. This is Mike. I'll start this out. I'm going to start it a little bit with material
costs. We've done actually very well over the last – I don't know, three years or four years, on material costs. I think
we've, in combination taken out over $1 billion. So over that timeframe – last year 2015 was a good chunk of that.
So it's been a combination of actually lower commodity prices have helped some, but all the work we've done on Lean,
[ph] re-sourcing, (35:33) engineered value change, our investments in R&D, our partnerships with suppliers have
helped generate a pretty good chunk of that cost reduction as well. So if you relate that to our price realization, that was
a net benefit for us in 2015. We had continued good material cost reduction and our pricing overall was pretty neutral.
It was favorable in the first half of the year, unfavorable in the second half.

As we look ahead to 2016, that'll probably shift down a little bit. I think given where commodity prices are right now,
we're not expecting as much benefit because we don't see another big leg down. So the material cost reduction that we
have in has a bit more of a concentration on the things that we do to get it. And by the same token, price realization is
tougher. And I think in large part or a chunk of what's going on, particularly in construction, is we've had a stronger
dollar over the course of the past year. There are translation effects of that that happen immediately. We're selling in
euros in Europe and that changes. But the competitive effects in the U.S. and in countries where, say, we and Komatsu
are competing against each other, say, whether it be Latin America or Europe, I think the impact of the stronger dollar
is starting to bite a little bit.
Another thing that's hurt us on price a bit, and particularly the fourth quarter, and this might be a little bit hard to
follow, but actually where we're selling product matters a bit. We have different price levels in different parts of the
world. And I would tell you, if you look at construction in the fourth quarter, there was a large decline in Latin
America, like 49% I think in CI. We tend to have better price realization there than we do in some other parts of the
world and so that hurt the overall kind of average price in the quarter as well.
So I guess bottom line, stronger dollar I think, very competitive environment with volumes lower, a little bit of negative
geography for us. The flipside of that is still continued good work on material costs.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I would just add...
<Q - Robert Wertheimer>: Thanks, Mike.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: ...a little philosophy here. You alluded to what we've tried to do over the last few
years, and you're exactly right. That's raised our market share. We've done well with that. That won't change. This
business is run on field population. And as long as that field population is building, it allows our dealers to really
survive in tough times like these and thrive in good times. That's going to continue.
But we have baked a little more in, as Mike said, for price. We've got the dollar situation. We've got excess capacity
with competitors all over the place and we think we can juggle that in a way where we can continue to move our
market position up while guarding the margin as well. But it's a balance. It's the same balance we've been working for
on the last five years or six years.
<Q - Robert Wertheimer>: Thank you, Doug.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Thanks, Rob.

Thank you. And your next question is coming from Joel Tiss. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Joel Gifford Tiss>: Bank of Montréal. How's it going, guys?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Okay, Joel. Good morning.
<Q - Joel Gifford Tiss>: That's good. I just wonder if you can help us a little bit with first half, second half color,
especially in E&T. You're going to have tough comps obviously in the first half of the year. Can you give us any idea
like revenue decline first half versus second half, or anything to help us figure that out?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yeah, Joel. I know I said a lot earlier, but if we look back at 2015, we had a lot more
decline in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. And that's because the first half of last year was
helped by the size of the backlog, particularly around drilling and well servicing. That's pretty much gone now. So I
think it's safe to say that year-over-year in that decline that we're expecting for Energy and Transportation, the 10% to
15%, it will probably be more than that in the first half and less than that in the second half. We don't really do the
quarterly breakdown, but your sentiment, what you're thinking, is absolutely correct. Year-over-year, a lot tougher in
the first half than the second half.

<Q - Joel Gifford Tiss>: Okay.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: I know that wasn't detailed, but...
<Q - Joel Gifford Tiss>: Yeah, but basically I get between the lines you're saying that that business is expected to be
pretty much flat for the year, so we can just figure out what that means.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: No. No. No. No. Down 10% to 15%, but probably down more than that in the first half
and probably less than that in the second half.
<Q - Joel Gifford Tiss>: Okay. And any signs of any aftermarket business stabilizing? That's usually the early
warning sign that we are deep enough into a downturn that things are starting to stabilize.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yeah, well, from a percentage and even dollar basis, the change – and aftermarket has
gone down, no doubt about that, over the last couple of years. But the decline is much less than what's happened in new
equipment. And the fourth quarter was down again. So right now, I would say there's no signs that that's really kicking
up. But the longer customers work existing machines and don't replace and as long as the output tends to hold up at
some point here, that will need to happen. So far it hasn't.
<Q - Joel Gifford Tiss>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Thanks, Joe.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from Ross Gilardi. Ross, please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Yeah, good morning. Thanks, guys. Bank of America. So, Mike, I believe you guys normally
have your annual impairment test in the fourth quarter. It doesn't look like you've booked any impairments, even
though you've had a Bucyrus competitor just write off 50% of its book value. So I'm just wondering if you could talk
about that. You're speaking very candidly about the pressures in the mining business that you've now been feeling for
four years in a row. So can you talk about the rationale for not writing down a big portion of goodwill on the back of
this latest test?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yeah, I can do that. So, first, the current mining business is weak. There's no doubt
about that. Second, what I would tell you is we just in the fourth quarter, to your point, we completed an impairment
test with what we believe is a pretty realistic forecast going forward and we had no impairment. If there's an event that
causes us or triggers us to do it again before the next fourth quarter, we will do that. But we did the math; there's no
impairment. But I think one thing you need to remember about this business is it's highly cyclical. Where the business
is at today, at least from our piece of it, the sales of equipment to that industry, we're well below a replacement level. It
has to return to at least a replacement level over time. You do an impairment test and that's a long-term view of what's
going to happen. It's not based on what's going to happen next year. And we've done it consistent with the way we
have. We didn't have an impairment. I don't know what else to say about that. I'm not on the inside in our competitors'
accounting department, so it's hard for me to comment on what they did.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Okay. Well, thanks for that. And then, Doug, I just had kind of a bigger picture question. The
last couple of days we have Zoomlion bidding for Terex publicly. And while they might not be a huge direct
competitor of Caterpillar's, does the prospect of a big Chinese OEM buying a listed U.S. company potentially set a
precedent that concerns Caterpillar?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: We saw a Sany buy Putzmeister, I don't know, three years or four years ago and
become really a dominant player and maybe beat down a player in concrete pumping. Crane business is still pretty
broad. I would guess we're going to see more Chinese investment in the United States in all kinds of things. We'll see
how this one sorts out, if it actually closes up. But it wouldn't surprise me to see some of that, yeah. I expect that's

probably a strategy.
If I were sitting over there in China, I'd be looking at some of this also. So I would expect to see some of that. I don't
think it's going to be an overwhelming wave of things, but certainly they're growing. And we've always said we'll see
one, two or three emerging Chinese competitors of some kind. And maybe that's a move like that around our industry,
certainly not in it, we don't really play too much against anymore. Although Terex is a good supplier through the Genie
brand to our dealers.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - David Raso>: Evercore ISI. I was just wondering if you could just help us a bit with the cadence of the earnings
for 2016, just given the moving parts around the restructuring savings, if you could give us some pace on that. And
even the accounting change, is it simply a linear day one and just run it out per quarter? Just for some sense of the
cadence exiting 2016.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yeah, David. Good, actually excellent, question. So on the pension, that just plays into
what the annual cost is and that will be spread evenly essentially over the course of the year. In terms of the
restructuring, most of the – at least the short term benefit that we were expecting for 2016, it's a result of heads out and
that is, as Doug said, on target, a little ahead of on target. So the vast majority of that will – I mean, what we gave you
was a full year number, so the vast majority of that has already happened as of the first of the year so that should be
pretty good to divide by four, probably not quite that. There's a bit more still to happen, but probably not massively off
dividing by four because a lot of the actions are effective at the end of the year this year.
<Q - David Raso>: That's what I was trying to think about with some of those savings up front and the pension
accounting help up front, when you look at the $4 number, ex-restructuring, any help at all on how you think about the
cadence then through the year?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yeah, if you just look at our last couple of quarters we've been right around $11 billion.
Now, the first and second quarter of 2015 were higher, but, again, that was before some of the declines that we were
expecting, like oil and gas. So I think as we've kind of gone down for oil and gas, now that that's out of the backlog, I
think if you look at the sales cadence for next year, it probably won't be massively off what a normal distribution is for
us. So probably a little bit lower in the first quarter, a little bit higher in the fourth and second quarters and a little bit
lower in the third quarter.
From a profit standpoint, first quarter will have a little bit below average sales likely. It's the middle of winter. Not
really the selling season, so probably a little weaker than average. So that will impact profit to the downside a little bit.
Flipside of that is the first quarter is usually a pretty good cost quarter, so that usually helps the first quarter a little bit.
So we're not actually providing guidance for the quarter, but all in all as you do your modeling, I would think about
probably first quarter down a little bit from the average profit, probably not massively far off it.
<Q - David Raso>: Okay. And last question, Doug. You spoke to commodity prices. You're not assuming much
recovery, the end markets not much recovery. But how are you managing for 2017? Saying it another way, if
commodities are at the end of this year where they are today, thinking through the inventory reduction you're targeting,
the $1 billion at dealers, just how should we think about 2017 if commodities are at the end of the year where they are
today? I mean, take us through your thoughts on replacement demand, inventory. When I look at the dealer inventory, I
mean, we went up $4.5 billion, $5 billion coming out of the Great Recession. In the last three years we've taken $5
billion out. So I can't say the inventory is down a lot over the last six years. We kind of went up, we're back down. Is
taking $1 billion out enough? And just, again, just try to set the stage a little bit how you're managing for 2017.

<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Well, right now it's all hands on deck for 2016 and hopefully we can get that done. I
would say around inventory and inventory turnover, as we have been implementing Lean and all of our initiatives
around our Cat Production System, I feel the fact that we've taken 30% off the top line and inventory down about the
same amount or so, just to stay even with that in a falling cycle is pretty darn good. Once we get stable at a bottom to
slightly rising turn, whenever that is, in a stable production schedule, I suspect our inventory turnover is going to be
very, very acceptable and ought to help us.
And that's about as far as I would go with that, David, because I don't know if oil or commodities, where they'll be from
a year from now and I really don't want to think about that other than inventory turnover, efficiency in the plants, our
variable margins, that's what's going to get us through that.
<Q - David Raso>: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: You bet.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Dave, this is Brad. Maybe one comment around how we're approaching this relative to
priorities. And so we didn't talk a lot about our actions up until September but we had taken significant restructuring
actions to that point. But, again, in June really of 2015, we started a process internally that led to our September
restructuring effort. By and large, the cost reduction we're talking about in period cost has protected R&D and our
digital spend and other priorities, so we've seen a significant reduction in a lot of the support areas in terms of
consolidation and efficiency.
I bring this up because sometimes we get the question, what are you going to do if sales continue to drop? And I can
tell you that we're continuing to work that plan. We understand and are committed to our decremental pull-throughs.
And so if sales do drop, we may have to cut those some, but we have other restructuring efforts that we're continuing to
look at and we'll be prepared and take action on those.
<Q - David Raso>: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Hi. Good morning. Credit Suisse. I guess two questions. One, Doug, you addressed a lot of, I
guess, your confidence level with the balance sheet and protecting the dividend. But can you give any color on how you
think about cash flow in 2016? If you look at over the past years, working capital's been a big source. I guess a concern
is that's running out and, if earnings are down in 2017, that the balance sheet is at risk. So your thoughts on that.
And then, Mike, I guess you gave a lot of help on the top line. I'm just trying to think about any color you're giving on
margins by segment, as I assume Resource is still not profitable. And in particular, E&T, how to think about margins as
we exit the year, because I think that's the concern as we approach 2017 with Solar rolling off. Thanks.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: That's a lot there. I'll start with the cash flow. We will have a reasonably good cash
flow in 2016 at the outlook levels. We'll cover our CapEx. Again, we're going to work hard to get that number down.
We'll cover our dividend and I suspect end up with positive cash flow above that so that we ought to be able to
maintain our balance sheet about where it is, if not strengthen it a bit more this year.
Again, I'm not going to get into 2017 too much, but the same philosophy would hold in terms of the priorities of
maintaining that. And in fact, if we have to get to a point in 2016 or 2017 to use the strength of the balance sheet to
protect the dividend, we will. And I've commented before about that. And I think 2016 at the outlook numbers we feel
pretty good about in terms of cash flow, et cetera.
And, Mike, you can handle the other ones.

Page 12 of 13
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yeah, just a little bit on the by segment, we did talk a lot about the sales change and not
much about the profit change by segment. So here's what I would say around that. So let's just backtrack a little bit and
look at 2015. What happened in 2015 to decrementals? Construction had an awesome year. Decrementals in
Construction were 10%, so their sales were down about $2.8 billion. Their profit was down less than $300 million. And
that was despite this legal charge that they got the end of the year. So very good year on managing decrementals.
Resource Industries, their decrementals were 36%. And I think that was a little over our target range. And partly
because despite sales going down, we spent more there on R&D. It's a business that we think will be good for the long
term and we needed to spend investment money in R&D there. And, in fact, we did. Energy and Transportation, they
had decrementals of 24%, which I think given the mix of what was down for them, if you look at how much of their
business was down because of oil and gas, which tended to be an above-average margin business, 24% I think for them
is pretty good.
In total for the company, and, again, this is excluding restructuring, we had decrementals of about 20%. That's kind of
what we've got baked into next year – I mean, overall 20%. I won't comment so much on ROS by segment. Resource
Industries, for example. They're at or below their breakeven point right now. So the ROS number I think is probably
less meaningful than the decremental.
And I think throughout the company we're working on delivering decent decrementals and a big cost reduction that we
have planned for next year, both on material costs, variable cost in total and the big restructuring should help all the
segments. So I'm not going to give ROS guidance. But I would say that certainly as a company, and I don't think any of
our segments would be big outliers here, we'll be at or better than our target decrementals.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Thank you. I'll get back in queue.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: All righty. I think we have time for one more.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. My first question is just a little bit more big
picture. Given the strength of the dollar and the weak emerging market economic activity that we're seeing around the
world, maybe specifically Canada and Latin America, is there any risk that we start to see equipment, either used or
new, come flowing back into the U.S. and then thus putting incremental pressure on new equipment sales in the U.S.?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Good morning, Ann. Actually, our EPA regulations have helped that to some degree
because of the requirements of low sulfur fuel on machines that are produced in this country and the EPA emissions
level. So there may be some of that, and we worried about that for a number of years. And I think you are probably also
alluding to the grey market that we have said we tend to see in times past where there's currencies that are a little bit out
of align.
I think the emissions thing between us and Europe and Japan for the most part and Canada will be involved with that.
There may be some flow from Canada here, but Mexico is not in that and Latin America. I think we'll probably have
some amelioration of what we've seen in historical levels of that, but it's something we would keep an eye on.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then on the smoothing of the pension plan and going
to mark-to-market, I mean there's a reason why we smoothed in the first place in order to reduce volatility. Are you
concerned that moving to mark-to-market might end up adding to your earnings volatility through the course of the
coming years?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yeah, Ann, this is Mike. A couple of things. Actually I can't remember the year.
Several years ago we made a change to sunset our main defined benefit plans at the end of 2019. And along the way,
we've been on a path to derisk the asset, the fund balance. We've moved to more fixed income rather than equity and

Page 13 of 13
that'll likely continue. It's going to sunset again at the end of 2019. That doesn't completely take out volatility, but I
think the combination of – we stopped adding people to that plan a long time ago, people in that plan are retiring, we're
not adding people to it. It'll stop at the end of 2019 with a shift towards more fixed income.
Probably be – what we're thinking it would reduce the volatility somewhat, it certainly won't take it away. I wouldn't
suggest that at all. But as more companies have moved to this method, I think when they have a year-end adjustment
for this, like we will at the end of this year, I think the market has done a decent job of understanding what's going on
and what it is for what it is.
So I don't think it'll – I mean, our view, anyway, is that it wouldn't impact so much how people are viewing us if there's
a year-end adjustment. And we like the change because it better matches what's actually happening from an expense
standpoint rather than spreading it over years. So in the current year, for example, and I said this before, this is not a big
unique OTO item that's happening in the year. It's taking out losses from prior years that were masking operating
results in the current year. That's our view, anyway.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Okay. I appreciate it, Mike. I know we're out of time, but just where will we be and what
inning will you be by the end of 2016 on restructuring? When will we be 100% done, or do we have costs in 2017 and
2018?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: We'll probably have some cost in 2017. And the plan that we announced last
September, I think the last parts of it I think we would expect to wrap up sometime in 2018.
