September 30, 2013 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are
qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP
financial measures. The definition of, and a reconciliation of such measures, can be found in our earnings release and
our 10-Q. filing. Please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income before
depreciation and amortization often referred to as EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a
non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings
release.
Finally, also note that the historical results for periods prior to June 20, 2013, described in the press release and on this
call have been adjusted to reflect the separation that was completed at the end of fiscal 2013.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to John.
John P. Nallen
Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, our financial results
continue to reflect strong top-line revenue growth. We reported first quarter fiscal 2014 revenues for the total company
of $7.06 billion, which is up 18% compared to the first quarter a year ago.
This growth reflects both the inclusion of revenues from newly consolidated businesses, such as Sky Deutschland and
our new international cable sports channels, as well as overall organic revenue growth, which was up in the high single
digits.
Total segment EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.62 billion, a 2% increase over the $1.59 billion reported in the first
quarter a year ago. This increase was led by our DBS and Television segments, partially offset by a challenging film
comparison and by slightly lower cable network contributions, which reflected the anticipated investment in launching
our new cable channels.
Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced our total reported EBITDA by 2%. You will also note
that our depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter of $313 million is up $139 million from the first quarter a
year ago. This increase is almost entirely due to the consolidation of Sky Deutschland and the related acquisition
amortization expense of approximately $100 million.
Nearly two-thirds of this Sky D amortization expense results from a one-time cumulative impact as we move toward
finalizing the purchase price allocation by the third quarter. Going forward, we expect Sky D related amortization to
run at approximately $30 million per quarter.
From a bottom-line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $768
million as compared to $2.25 billion reported the first quarter a year ago.
Last year's quarterly results included $1.37 billion of income in other net, principally related to the gain on the sale of
our ownership stake in NDS. Excluding the net income effects in both years of amounts reflected in other net and
impairment charges and the gains from participating in BSkyB share repurchase program, first quarter adjusted
earnings per share were $0.33 this year versus $0.38 in the prior year.
Now, let me provide some additional context on the performance of a few of our businesses, and let's start with the
Cable Networks. Overall, total segment revenues increased 12% from last year, highlighted by a 17% increase in
affiliate revenues and 11% advertising growth. The 17% affiliate revenue growth was led by higher rates across our
channels. Domestic affiliate fees increased 10% primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and Fox
News. Our reported international affiliate fees were up 40%. Within this overall increase, affiliate fees at the non-sports
channels at FIC and at STAR grew 19% in local currency terms.
The balance of the affiliate fee increase was from the international sports channels, led by this year's inclusion of ESS,
Star Sports, EMM and FOX Sports Italy, which was partially offset by the unfavorable foreign exchange impact.

First quarter advertising revenue growth was led by a 21% increase at the international channels, which reflected an
approximate 20% local currency increase at the FIC and STAR non-sports channels.
The increase in ad revenues related to the international sports channels was fully offset by the negative impact from
unfavorable foreign currency movements. Domestic advertising increased 6%, reflecting double-digit gains at FX and
the RSNs, partially offset by political advertising declines at Fox News.
As anticipated, this quarter's EBITDA results at the Cable segment reflected the commencement of the investments we
are making in our new channel launches as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign currency comparisons. As a
result, total segment EBITDA in the quarter of $991 million declined 2% from year ago levels. We had continued
strong EBITDA growth from the RSNs, Fox News, Fox Business, National Geographic and our international channels.
This growth was more than offset by the impact of the investments in the new domestic channel launches, a 3%
negative impact from foreign currency movement, and the absence of prior year distributor credits. Combined, all of
these factors impacted year-on-year comparisons by a bit over $100 million with the new domestic channel launches
alone representing around a $50 million impact. In addition, we had increased programming and marketing costs at FX
related to the launch of new series.
At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $231 million increased 30% over the first quarter, largely due to
a doubling of retransmission revenues. Total segment ad revenues were similar to a year ago as the benefit from higher
sports ratings and ad pricing was offset by lower general entertainment ratings and reduced political revenues at the
stations.
At our Film segment, first quarter EBITDA was $328 million, down 24% from a year ago. While we are pleased with
the hit releases impacting the quarter, including The Wolverine and The Heat, we did not have a comparable film to last
year's extraordinarily successful release of Ice Age: Continental Drift.
Revenues and EBITDA contributions at our television production units were up year-over-year, primarily due to
Modern Family entering domestic syndication and the sale of the first two seasons of New Girl to Netflix.
Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $190 million in the quarter as compared to $95 million in the prior year
quarter. This increase reflects a nearly $60 million improvement at SKY Italia, driven by the absence of costs
associated with last year's London Olympics broadcast. It also reflects the impact from the consolidation of Sky
Deutschland's positive EBITDA results. Total revenues at this segment increased by $562 million, principally
reflecting the inclusion of $520 million in Sky Deutschland's revenues. Sky D reported ARPU gains of 6% and a
year-over-year direct subscriber increase of 317,000.
At SKY Italia, local currency revenues in the quarter were similar to a year ago, as a 2% ARPU increase was offset by
lower average subs for the period. Quarter end subscribers of 4.76 million were unchanged from the end of June.
Now, before I turn to guidance, let me make just a couple of comments related to our capital structure. We ended the
quarter with $6.7 billion in cash and $17.5 billion in gross debt. This debt position reflects the issuance of $1 billion of
new long-term debt during the quarter, recognizing that we have approximately $900 million of scheduled debt
maturities in calendar 2014.
Related to the stock buyback, since the date of the separation, we have been consistently repurchasing Fox A shares,
resulting in approximately $1.3 billion of repurchases from July 1 through today. We are on pace to complete the $4
billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe we previously announced.
And let me finally address our guidance update for fiscal 2014. Chase will provide more commentary in a moment
around our businesses, and while we have one quarter under our belt, it's still quite early in our fiscal year. However,
based on all of the assumptions inherent in our current projections, we continue to expect that our total segment
EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2014 will be in the high single to low double-digit range above the $6.2
billion total segment EBITDA base level of fiscal 2013.
And now, let me turn the call over to Chase.

Charles G. Carey
Thanks, John. It's only been a few months since we outlined our objectives and strategies for our business at our
Investor Day in August, yet we are more excited than ever about our future. We are on plan in building the foundation
for sustainable long-term growth and are on course overall to meet our financial targets for this year.
The highlight of our last quarter was the successful launch of our two new U.S. networks: FOX Sports 1 and FXX. Our
short-term priority was establishing the distribution base from which we can grow ratings and subscriber revenue, and
we exceeded our targets in launching FS1 and FXX to 90 million and 72 million homes respectively.
Our initial ratings have been mixed with success in certain places, particularly with established events and programs.
These new channels generated ratings that are a multiple of their predecessors. However, programming schedules are
clearly a work in progress. We knew going in that building these networks would take a few years, not months, and
many of our signature events and programs are yet to be launched.
At our more established U.S. cable networks, results were in line with our plans. We had strong results in areas like our
regional sports networks, while others like Fox News, although it's dominant as ever competitively, faced expected
year-on-year headwind comparisons due to 2012 political spending.
It was actually a relatively quiet quarter for our established networks as we prioritized the new channel launches. The
last month has been busier with an array of initiatives. Fox News launched a new primetime lineup, live news structure
and host on our morning show with great early results. For example, primetime ratings in the first two weeks of the
new lineup are up north of 20% in both demos and overall. FX launched new seasons of Sons of Anarchy and
American Horror Story to record ratings. National Geographic Channel has a number of specials and series launches,
such as Killing Kennedy scheduled for this month.
Internationally, we continue to expand, launching new sports channels in Italy and the Netherlands, bringing the total
reach of FOX Sports outside of the U.S. to 75 million homes. Last month, we announced a groundbreaking multiyear
rights agreement with the German Bundesliga, one of the world's premier soccer leagues. This agreement is a testament
to the strength of our global portfolio of channels and our unique ability to reach every corner of the globe. Overall, our
international channels continue to execute well and are on target in spite of some economic headwinds in southern
Europe and the adverse consequences of the strong dollar. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the long-term
growth potential of our international businesses and believe they are better positioned competitively than ever before.
In our broadcast business, our results have been mixed this fall. On the positive side, we continue to build the dual
revenue stream business through both retransmission and reverse compensation with our affiliates. Sports has been a
strength and we are excited about the start of our new drama, Sleepy Hollow, and believe a few of our new comedies
show promise. On the flip side, the ratings of a number of returning franchises have been below our expectations.
With our new focus on year-round programming, we are in the early part of the broadcast season and we look forward
to new series like Almost Human, which premieres in two weeks, as well as the return of American Idol in January and
event series like Cosmos and 24 later in the year.
The advertising market trends continue to be solid. Scatters being sold at double-digit pricing to the upfront for
broadcast, and scatter pricing for cable networks like FX is even stronger. The local ad market finished the September
quarter up mid-single digits excluding politicals and Olympics, and is also up a bit excluding politicals for the
December quarter. Our station successfully launched Modern Family in syndication in September and our newest
station, Charlotte, is already ahead of our targets.
Our studios continue to look to take advantage of global demand for content particularly in our television studio.
Twentieth Century Fox Television and its sibling studios are producing 40 series for 16 networks this season, including
series like Modern Family, Homeland, American Horror Story and How I Met Your Mother, which were all Emmy
award winners this year.

Our film studio has been a bit more up and down to start the year, however, we are excited about holiday releases like
Walking with Dinosaurs and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and releases in the second half of the year including Rio 2
and X-Men: Days of Future Past.
At our distribution platform businesses, our goals are to grow market share through premium content, technology
leadership and superior customer service. In Italy, we are executing our plan to right size SKY Italia's cost structure and
believe we are stabilized in subscriber base in spite of an Italian economy that continues to struggle. In Germany, Sky
Deutschland announced its results this morning with another solid quarter that maintains the growth of recent quarters
as further proof that this business is succeeding in Europe's dominant economy. We are also really pleased about the
appointment of Mike Hopkins as the new CEO of Hulu. I can't think of a better executive to lead Hulu's exciting future.
Bottom line, we feel good about the momentum of our business. We have a few soft spots to address, but that is always
the reality of our business. We're excited about the future and look forward to taking our business to the targets we
outlined in August.
With that, we are happy to take your questions.
Reed Nolte
Operator? Can we go to taking questions from the investment community now, please?
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Hey, thanks very much, guys. The strength in television was a little bit more than I would have
expected and I'm wondering were there any major step-ups in retransmission consent agreements that kicked in or
reverse comp deals for that matter. And can you give us maybe without even naming the distributors but in terms of
timing for the next year, are there any other major step-ups coming this year that you can see? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes, I guess we don't want to get into agreements name-by-name. Certainly, in the last 12
months, we certainly have one large agreement that would have been material really to an array of networks, certainly,
again, you're talking to broadcast segment certainly to...
<Q - David Bank>: Yeah.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: ... retransmission. I think the affiliates are a bit more ongoing. Yeah, I think we said before
we're pretty well through the retransmission really at this point. Yeah, we did have one large one that we got done this
calendar year. We have a couple more left and almost will come around probably to a second cycle of it starting within
the next couple of years.
<Q - David Bank>: Okay. So are we not expecting any sort of major step-ups for the remaining – off of this run rate
for the remainder of this fiscal year?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: For this – we have some deals to do. I mean we'll always going to have – there's probably
rarely a year we don't have deals to do. So that group is always busy at Christmas time, so they don't plan Christmas
holidays.
<Q - David Bank>: Thank you very much.

And that comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you. I guess going back to the balance sheet, John, you mentioned you have so
much cash on hand and now that News Corp has spun – the new News Corp has spun, that money settled. I guess can
you update us, John or Chase, a bit what your priorities are in terms of uses of capital? And what is preventing you
from buying in the balance of Sky D? Like why wait?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Well, again, I think we've said what our priorities there. They're a combination of sort of
investing in our existing businesses to grow them opportunistically, certainly the channels, we're going right now, and I
think we're an example of that return to capital to shareholders and we've committed to $4 billion that we're going to
buy back this year and, as John said, we are on track with that.
And I think us being opportunistic. We have acknowledged this sort of leave us with a liquid balance sheet, but it's
something we'll continue to address, and as we went through this buyback, see where we are as we get sort of later in
the fiscal year and determine what makes sense from there. I think this is a business in a world that's moving quickly
enough that you want to make these judgments as you go along as opposed to locking yourself into straight-jackets that
may preclude making smart decisions.
I think in terms of Sky D, look, we're flat. We're pleased with where we are. Our focus isn't growing that business and
we feel great about the business, again, they just reported today. And I think it was really very much maintaining the
momentum they've had in that business, but we're comfortable where we are and we'll see what makes sense as we go
forward.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Okay. Just as a quick follow-up in terms of cost. What is the timing of FOX Sports 2 and
will there be a significant impact on costs?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: No, I think the focus is really FOX Sports 1 and FXX. They are certainly the short-term
focuses, I think. FS2, we want to be as successful as it can but really – I think I'd say the priorities are FS1 and FXX,
I'm not sure of changing FOX Sports 2.
But I think FS2 is more to give us flexibilities we build out to sports channels in time, so it's helpful, add few channels
to where you play events and where you move. And I think we wanted to get the lineup set right. We had a handful of
channels that we thought we could do something more with FUEL, Fox Soccer, SPEED and we wanted to get those
channels in place for long-term growth. That being said, I think the focus will be on the bigger channels and FS2 will
follow sort of behind FS1.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Thanks, Jessica. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
That comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to explore quickly a little bit on the revenue side of the domestic cable
network re-brand networks. I know it's a long-term process and only a couple months into it, but one thing that sticks
out to me is you've got a lot more households at networks like FOX Sports 1 and FXX. And if you can compare that to
your affiliate fee growth of 10% year-over-year, which you attribute mostly to pricing at some of the big, more
established networks, just wondering how you could walk us through the math of how all those new households will
eventually contribute to that growth? And just how the shape of that grows over time? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Again, if you go back to two channels you talked – two new channels essentially, FXX and
FS1, what they really were converting channels that were in place with agreements in place for distribution. And as we
go forward and we have obviously done it with some, but the majority still to come, but over the next couple years, we
have agreements coming up essentially, so agreements coming up with really all our major distributors, and we will

Next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Thanks. I guess, it's a boring numbers question, do you any chance to have the domestic
cable network ad growth ex-FOX News and noted that it was down year-over-year on political comps?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess it would be a touch.
<A - John P. Nallen>: A bit higher.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: It's below the average. I don't know. I probably can't do a weighted average off the top of my
head.
<A - John P. Nallen>: I would say just a touch higher, Doug, is where it would be.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: All right. Another question along those lines, TV stations I think you said broadcast
overall was flat. I was just curious if you could tell us what TV stations advertising performance was in the quarter?
<A - John P. Nallen>: Well, obviously, it was impacted by politicals. Year-on-year, it was a very big political year a
year ago versus now, but the base markets were up when we take political and Olympics out. So we would have
participated as in the growth that the base markets had.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: I don't suppose you know what the political ad comp was for the quarter off hand?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Well, I think all in with politicals I think they were down, the markets were down like high
single digits, I think with politicals and Olympics out, they were up – the Olympics on a market basis as well that were
sort of up mid-single digits. So that was the magnitude of the market impact.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: And then last one for you. This is the first time I've seen you sort of break out
international drivers between non-sports and sports. Any chance you can give us a sense of how big the non-sports
networks are in total versus the sports network for either revenue or EBITDA, so we can sort of gauge those trends
separately?
<A - John P. Nallen>: It's probably easier to go the other way, which is I think this will anniversary some time in the
second quarter, which is why we separated it out, because this year, we have all these brand new sports networks. But
in total, we probably had somewhere around $130 million of revenue from the sports networks this year as against
really those sports networks not existing a year ago.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Got it. Any chance you'd give a similar driver on the EBITDA side?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I don't think they're that...
<A - John P. Nallen>: No.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: They're not that material on the EBITDA, because there are a couple that are still in a startup
phase, Japan, Italy and a couple that are more profit centered. The EBITDA number is positive, but not that significant.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Great. That's it from my end. Thank you.

Yes. That comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. John, I just wanted to confirm on the amortization of Sky D if that was a
couple pennies this quarter, the sort of catch-up? I think you said was $100 million versus a $30 million normal. Is that
accurate?
<A - John P. Nallen>: Ben, when you work through everything, tax effect, minority interest, it's a penny.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay. But the $100 million and $30 million are right – that's $100 million in this quarter
and $30 million on a run rate going forward?
<A - John P. Nallen>: That's correct.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay. Got it. And then you give that really nice schedule of revenue growth by
component when you reported 20% affiliate revenue growth for the company. Obviously, that includes some of the
new acquired networks or newly consolidated networks. Do you have any sort of clean growth rate for the quarter by
any chance?
<A - John P. Nallen>: I mean, you mean just...
<A - Charles G. Carey>: You're talking about affiliates?
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Yeah. It's the biggest...
<A - John P. Nallen>: Yeah. I think that the way to look at it is affiliates, as I said, affiliates without sports, because
sports are brand new.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Right.
<A - John P. Nallen>: There's [ph] not at the top (26:36). Affiliate international is up roughly 20%.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: And it wouldn't be that meaningful to the U.S. because the U.S. by and large were more
conversions to networks that we'll get – there's some resetting, but again, the majority will get reset over the coming
couple of years.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: And lastly, just on SKY Italia, Chase? I mean subs flattened. Are we maybe near the
bottom here on the top line challenges that that business has had? Do you think we could start to see ARPU and
subscriber growth, I'm almost afraid to say it out loud, but some time over the next three or four quarters?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I hope so. I think we believe that. Like we said, our goal for SKY Italia this year was really
to stabilize it. I think that's on track. I think there are a number of things in terms of getting on top of numbers like
churn and the like that we feel good about. The economy is still really shaky. I don't want to get too far out in front of
ourselves in projecting how that turns. We are making headway on the cost. We've got a couple of significant contracts
we are winding our way out of that will help us on the cost level going forward. So I think all our plans are on track and
I think we've got some nice traction in terms of some of the initiatives we put in place. It does feel like we are
stabilizing that business. And certainly, as we look at probably over next year to two as opposed to quarter to two,
again I think for this year what we are looking to do is really stabilize the business and I think return to growth as we
go past this fiscal year. So I guess I'm probably more talking in years than quarters. I mean quarters get a little micro to
be talking about that business, but I think still our plan would be to say we are stabilizing it this year, putting good
things in place that can sort of have it getting on top of the cost that will enable us both on top line, subscribers, and
bottom-line as we return to growth and fulfill the potential we still believe is there.
Even – and that is not assuming the economy is going to give us any tailwinds. That's assuming the economy certainly
for the next couple of years is going to continue to be pretty challenging. We hope it gets better but that's what we plan.

Comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you. Just following up on your commentary on the Fox Network? Can you give us
some color on how your general entertainment shows are doing versus your expectations for the upfront sales? And I
guess are there any shortfalls meaningful enough at this point that we should think about them in terms of impacting the
advertising revs going forward in the coming quarters?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: No, as I said, first, on the latter, it's really early in the year. As we have said, we really have
tried to move strategically in how we approach the network, so we've launched a handful of shows, we've got a lot of
shows in front of us.
It's still early even shows like X Factor, it's been disappointing to date, but we'll see where it comes back out of the
World Series preemptions. So as I said, it's been a bit mixed and we've had some places that we have some upside like
sports and some of the new shows have done well and some of the returning shows have been disappointing. But it is a
mixed bag and at this point, we still feel we are on course to hit the targets we've got, but we've got a lot of things, a lot
of events in front of us to go forward with.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: All right. Thanks very much.

Comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert S. Fishman>: Hi. It's Robert on for Michael. Can you talk about the FX Now app? Given that you have a
lot of content spread across the web, do you expect to pull back any of your FX shows to make it more exclusive to
your own service? And has this app been contemplated in your previous affiliate negotiations? And just lastly, does
launching FX Now change your thought process on signing any future SVOD deals? Thanks a lot.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: What I'd say about FX, which really probably is certainly not unique to FX, it's true about
any of our networks, what is clear is you are moving from a – the world is moving from a place where the linear
network experience is just one part of the viewer experience and we want to have a brand and on top of that a network
that enables viewers to watch that programming, again, the proverbial, when they want, where they want, how they
want. And I think increasingly we feel it's tremendously important for us for all our networks to have the ability to
deliver that experience to consumers, build business models around it with distributors and ourselves that enable us to
deliver on that experience and deal with – continue to still deal with the SVOD market, which is an important part of
our overall business. But create the right lines for where our content resides, and how people find it.
And I think it's important that we create the appropriate – that our networks have an appropriate distinction and are able
to distinguish themselves by the product they control, and what they control and how they present it. So it is certainly
an area that's important to us, we'll be spending more time on it, but it's not unique to FX.

And that comes from the line of John Janedis with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thank you. Chase, for the past few quarters you've highlighted strength in, I think, both Latin
America and Asia at FIC. With some of the headlines that have come out of those regions, are you seeing any kind of
headwinds outside of currency?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: For those regions? No, actually, if anything, Latin America has probably been a little better,
I think. Asia has been pretty much where we expected it. I mean the regions I said that we still see headwinds is
southern Europe. But they'll always ebb and flow when you get individual countries. But by and large, I think those
places, those regions, Asia and Latin America, have been okay. They ebb and flow a bit but, if anything, again, I'd say
Latin America in particular probably is more of an ebb up in the last few months than down.

That comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike C. Morris>: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Hi.
<Q - Mike C. Morris>: My question is around understanding the timing and progression of the investment in the new
channels. You called out, or you highlighted two-thirds of the expense increase was attributable to the net costs
associated with the launches and I think that that seems like it's in the neighborhood of $200 million to $225 million in
the quarter. I think we've been expecting something in the mid-$200s million for net investment for the year. So are we
right there in that a significant portion of the full-year investment was done in the first quarter on a net basis. And then
also, looking to 2015, can you kind of remind us what the net investment looks like there given the shift of baseball in
particular? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I'm not sure we shifted baseball, so I'm not sure what you mean by the shift in
baseball.
<Q - Mike C. Morris>: The baseball cost at FOX Sports 1.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I think when we've talked, that was – I think we had those rights in place. So I think
what we described before, baseball's not a shift from what we described before. So that when I talked in August, I
know the baseball agreements were in place, so what we've been discussing reflects the agreements we've got in place.
First, we're pretty much on track with what we planned for these numbers. So, again, what we sort of said was over the
next two years, and that's really the investment spends, and then that become positive in fiscal 2016. It's in aggregate
over the two years, $400 million to $500 million, $200 million plus, in each year. Probably a little bit actually heavier
in 2015 and 2014, but $200 million plus and we're pretty much on track. And I think John gave a number for the new
networks in the quarter.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Right.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: This quarter that was about $50 million.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Right. Well, the swing $50 million.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yes. The swing was $50 million. So I mean, again, the FXX didn't launch until September,
and FOX Sports 1 was late October.

<A - John P. Nallen>: Right.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: But right now, we're essentially on track with what we planned for those. And again, as John
said, there were a couple of other things that occurred in the quarter, beyond the launches of the two channels that
adversely affected the comparison.
<A - John P. Nallen>: And I'd add, as you dig into those numbers, the expense increases overall for the segment. So
you would have a not insignificant increase related to all those new sports networks that we just covered: EMM, ESS,
Japan, Italy, et cetera.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I was talking the domestic.
<A - John P. Nallen>: You were covering the domestic?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: The domestic, yeah. So the $200 million plus was worldwide but for the $50 million we
were talking the domestic two start-ups.
<Q - Mike C. Morris>: Okay. Great. That helps. Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Comes from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alan S. Gould>: Thank you. Just a follow-up on that cable network. So we have $50 million of the, call it, $200
million plus this quarter. Is it going to roll in about £50 million a quarter? And secondly, your other line was a minus
$122 million? Is that basically the corporate overhead and is that a good run rate for the year?
<A - John P. Nallen>: I'll cover the second one, which is – it's mainly the corporate overhead but it also includes the
inter-company [ph] profitable limb, (36:59) which runs heavier in the first quarter because of product moving among
the divisions. So I think if you go back to the Investor Day, we indicated we expected a run rate of the segment for the
year to be around $400 million and that's about where we think it should be for the year.
<Q - Alan S. Gould>: Okay.
<A - John P. Nallen>: And on the first one, just to clarify, what we said is that our expectation is to incur during the
year a net investment of $200 million in the launches of the channels. The impact of that – the $50 million impact we
covered is the year-on-year impact of the domestic channels having the group of channels Chase referred to before
against having FS1 and FX and that's the $50 million. So we are right on – as Chase indicated, we are right on plan
against all those numbers as we stand right now.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, and I don't think we want to get too granular on quarter-to-quarter. In general, it's sort
of proportional but there'll always be ebbs and flows based on, particularly, as you get into rights and launches, which
is just the nature of the business. As we said, even on an established channel, FX launched a couple of big originals in
the third quarter and that created a year-on-year variance there so – a spending variance.
So generally that's the case and it is also, including the business as a whole, the effect on the top line as we go through
distribution agreements.
<Q - Alan S. Gould>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Alan. Could we have next question please, operator?

And that comes from Vijay Jayant with International Strategy and Investment Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Hi. A question on Hulu, given you guys have – the partners and yourself put in $750 million in
this new leadership. Do you sort of foresee this asset transforming into something else than sort of the catch-up TV it
is? And I'm really bringing it to the forefront with respect to valuation of Netflix. How could this asset with the best
programmers in the business really be monetized?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I think, in general, I'm going to probably let management of Hulu speak to the plans
for Hulu. Obviously, we believe in it. We've made a significant investment in it going forward. We think there are real
opportunities in the digital space to both create something that can be a real positive for us for sort of the existing
distribution ecosystem as well as a platform that competes with in its own way with the Netflix and the like of the
world in creating an alternative in that digital space.
The management has only – Mike Hopkins has only been in place for a week or two, but I think he'll – probably
appropriate to let him be the one who describes how that strategy rolls out.

Comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Vasily, are you there?
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Can you hear me?
<A - John P. Nallen>: Yeah.
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Sorry about that. My question is on the international networks? Is Southern Europe still
getting worse? Some of your peers said that it was a drag earlier in the year, but now it's sort of bottoming out? And
then another question I had, some your peers again have found a way to fight that slump in Europe by converting
channels into free-to-air and accelerating advertising growth? Not that your growth is anemic by any means. But is that
a strategy that does not fit your assets you think or if you could give us an idea of how you think about that, please.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Because it's – certainly Southern Europe, whether it's sort of, I guess you could say, maybe
it's – whether it's bottomed out, it certainly is tracking below where it still was a year ago. So in our international
segment, Southern Europe is a drag year-on-year comparison.
I don't think it's necessarily getting worse, but it's still not where we would like it to be. For us, we compete
aggressively on all fronts. We actually have a free-to-air vehicle in Italy. So we want to be opportunistic.
That being said, I think we are generally much more a believer in long-term values created through revenues with dual
– do businesses with dual revenue streams and I think that would continue to be the core of what we focus on. I don't
think you ever sort of – never say never to anything and again, if there's a place to do something that makes sense, we'd
look at it. But I think by and large, we believe the dual revenue business model is the right one to really build long-term
value.

<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thanks. I have two questions. The first is, what is your appetite for additional TV station
assets, particularly in NFC markets? And the second question is, how do you think about cable consolidation? Would
this put downward pressure on affiliate fees over time? Any comments you could make.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: First, there aren't a lot of NFC markets we're not in, so that's a pretty finite world. We have a
pretty full station group. I think we'll always be opportunistic, but I don't think you could say it's a strategy when there's
only a couple markets we're not in. So I think if there's something that makes sense, we'll always look at it. But by and
large, we're pretty pleased with the station growth as we did in Charlotte, if there's an opportunity to do something that
we think creates value for us, we want to be opportunistic.
In terms of consolidation, I think we're in a world where you're probably going to have a degree of consolidation.
Scale's going to matter. Large players are going to get larger. We are. We're launching new networks, continuing to
expand our content. I think we're pretty comfortable with our ability to meet our goals and to navigate this space, and
believe we have enough wind at our back, and do believe content still is the place to be in a digital world that is – as
much as there, as fast as there's consolidation there seem to be new buyers. So I think we probably would not be
surprised if there is consolidation, but I don't think it changes our expectations or plans or confidence in our ability to
execute our plans.

That question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: I just have a broader question about the studio for Mr. Carey. The studio business seem
to go through these multi-decade runs where people focus on lower budget films, and then they move towards tent
poles and back towards lower budget films, and we seem to be sort of in the sixth or seventh year of everyone in the
industry pursuing tent poles. Do you think we're in a new era now, and this is just the studio model that will exist, or do
you anticipate there's going to be another shift where people go back to...
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess everybody always tries to sort of look at film business and draw conclusions about
sort of the trends, and how films are being made. I think realistically we try and make great films, and some of those
are less expensive, some of those are more. I think you can be realistic about the business you are in, so the last three or
four years, or five years, is home entertainment market shifted. You've got to be realistic about how you approach, and
what you invest in, and how you navigate a business that obviously is a complicated one to navigate. But I think the
minute you start believing there are formulas for what types of films to make, I think you probably are putting yourself
in a corner. So I think you continue to look for great films. Some of those will be – some of them will be at the
low-end, some of them at the high-end, some of them are in the middle. And we've got a couple of big films next year
we're very excited about. We had a film this year on the other end like The Heat, which was great for us. So I think
those sort of conclusions or judgments are really not how you manage the business by filling up – trying to fill up slots.

whatnot, I see you've been promoting catching up on Sleepy Hollow on it, and the type of behavior you're seeing from
viewers on it. And then just as a second one, I believe you guys partnered up with Twitter on their new amplified
product to do some promotions around the new fall season, and just interested how that early test worked?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: We feel – I mean it's difficult to sort of go through them one by one, because in many ways
we've got a blur of activity. As I said, what is clear, whether it's Fox or FX or sports or news, for that matter, we're
clearly moving very quickly into a multidimensional world, a multi-platform world, and people accessing that content
in different shapes and forms, and want to have an ability to create experiences around that content, and we've got to
meet that. And actually we feel good. On the Fox Network, we've had a position of leadership in the social networking
space really for a period of time now. We want to build on that. We think things like some of the relationships you

experiences to consumers.

Comes from the line of James Dix with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - James G. Dix>: Hi. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Just two for you. You mentioned earlier your sale of
two seasons of New Girl to Netflix? Just wondering more broadly how we should be thinking about the SVOD revenue
line? Is that kind of a $300 million to $400 million figure all in, which is growing a little bit this year? Or are there any
more step function changes in that that we could be looking for?
And then just secondly, want to know kind of what your view is on reverse compensation going forward as part of that
fee line going into the TV stations? Do you think there's some misallocation or disconnect between the share of value
which is going to affiliates and how much is being contributed by the network programming that's going to be caught
up? Or is most of the growth just going to be catching up with the basic re-trans that is going on industry-wide?
Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Part of it. What was the first part of the question?
<Q - James G. Dix>: Just the SVOD outlook.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Oh, the SVOD. Yeah, I think the SVOD – look, it's a significant – certainly it's an important
business for us. We are actively engaged in it. I think this year we are probably expecting it to be sort reasonably flat
year-on-year. But that being said, that's sort of – it's one we don't want to get in front of ourselves projecting. There's a
lot of discussions going on on product that's not in those projections.
In many ways SVOD is part of the larger digital space so I don't think you want to define it too narrowly in terms of the
appetite for our product in these digital platforms. It is one we continue to aggressively pursue. Certainly
internationally is probably an area. It is in earlier growth stages as a number of countries are just – a number of the
players are just moving into, but I think you are going to continue to see players in this and we are obviously going to
be part of – from different directions as people talked about, Fox Now or FX on-demand and all of that becomes part of
this digital experience and how do you monetize it. Both through subscriptions and advertising and sales, and we are
going to participate it in all fronts. The pure SVOD revenues again for the current year will be – are reasonably flat
year-on-year for us, but there are a lot of discussions going on that aren't necessarily reflected in those. And it's an area
in general, which I guess I'd say the digital platforms delivering a richer content experience that we expect to be a real
area of growth for us as we go forward in the next few years.
<Q - James G. Dix>: Just a second one, just to simplify it. Do you think the share just the networks are contributing of
the value that is being paid in re-trans has been going up over the past couple of years? Is that going to be one of the
dynamics of the reverse compensation growth going forward?

<A - Charles G. Carey>: Reverse compensation – you mean from our affiliates to us?
<Q - James G. Dix>: Exactly. Right.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I mean, certainly the reverse compensation is an important part of our overall
broadcast business. We are investing a lot in content that is still the most important content out there and it's important
for us to receive fair value. We greatly value our relationship with our affiliates. It's a partnership that has been good
for all of us. But we need to have business models that enable us to generate that dual revenue, whether it's directly
through our O&Os and retransmission or reverse comp through affiliate relationships that enable all of us to be
successful. We obviously want successful affiliates. We want to them to grow and be successful and be able to fulfill
that partnership to sort of great local programming with event national programming, and that's the goal we have. But
as part of that we do need to really – the reverse compensation component of it to be important. We think the value of
our broadcast signal to everybody who deals with it is probably still undervalued competitively any way you look at it
the marketplace today. The importance of that content and the viewership of it still clearly is not reflected in what we
get, but we've tried to approach it in a constructive way that starts to recognize that value and move it in the right
direction.

<Q - Barton Crockett>: Okay. Thank you for taking the question. I was curious about your cash spend on share
repurchase, which had settled into this nice, healthy pace of $4 billion or so a year. Clearly you can afford to do more.
What would it take to get you guys to step that up, and why don't you do more to move closer to the leverage targets
that you could support there as a company?

point in time. And it is what we thought was appropriate for this year. As we move towards – so as we move towards
