MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Fixed-Income Conference
Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session;
instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Ms. Vivian Zhou. Please go ahead.
Vivian Y. Zhou
Thank you, welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion. The discussion today contains certain
forward-looking statements, about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are
subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words, believe, expect, intend, plan, aim, will, should,
likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the
company's financial and other goals, are set forth within second quarter 2013 fixed-income slides and in the company's
2012 10-K and Q1 2013 10-Q, already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP
financial measures may be found in today's presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that
may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at, ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that
information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with David Yowan, Executive Vice President and Corporate Treasurer, who will provide
a second quarter 2013 capital and funding update including some key points related to the company's financial
performance and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Dave completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. Joining Dave for the Q&A session will be Ken
Paukowits, Vice President of Investor Relations.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dave.
David L. Yowan
Thank you, Vivian, and thanks to all of you for joining. We're pleased to host this fixed income investor conference call

Today, we're going to provide you with a capital and funding and liquidity management update. Some of you may have
joined us on our earnings call yesterday, and there are some key points from that call that I would like to reemphasize.
Then, I'll take you through some specifics on our capital position and liquidity profile.
Turning to the slides, we'll start with slide two, which describes our second quarter financial performance. Revenues –
reported revenues grew at 4% on adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates they also increased 4% as well. This
compares to revenue growth of 4% in the first quarter on a reported basis and 5% on an FX adjusted basis.
Due to strong operating expense discipline as well as a slightly lower tax rate, net income grew at 5% while diluted
EPS at $1.27 per share was up 10% due to the decline in our shares outstanding, which you see at the bottom of the
slide attributable to our share repurchase activity.
Our reported return on average equity for the quarter was 24%. Remember that, that return on equity reflects
performance over a four-quarter period and so is still impacted by the three special items that we recorded in the fourth
quarter of last year. Without those three items, ROE would have been 27%.
Slide three just describes the – some of the revenue drivers and important business metrics behind that performance.
You'll see that billed business on a reported basis increased 7%; on an FX adjusted basis, it increased 8%. That
compares to 6% and 7% respectively in the first quarter very much in line, therefore, with the last several quarters of
billed business growth.
Total cards in force increased to $104.3 million. That's up 4%. Proprietary card issuance increased by 2% with the rest
of the card in force increase coming from our GNS business. We deepened engagement with our existing card
members, as average card member spend increased by 4% and then we continue to grow a card member loans at low
double – low single-digit rates, excuse me, increasing 3% on a reported basis and 4% on an FX adjusted basis.
Turning to slide four, we describe the performance in our – write-off performance in our charge card portfolios. On the
left-hand side, we have the performance for USCS. That includes our U.S. consumer and U.S. small business
portfolios. Our write-off rate for the second quarter at 1.9% is at or near historic lows, and as you can see from the
chart, very stable over time. That ratio reflects write-off dollars over receivable balances.
On the right-hand side, we show the write-off history, the net loss history for our corporate card and for our consumer
and small business charge card portfolios outside of the U.S. Here the ratio is losses over billed business, and so that's
why it's calibrated at a very different level. But you can also see that the write-off rates there, the net loss rates have
been very low and again are at or near historic lows.
Page five gives our lending credit performance on a worldwide basis. On the left-hand side, our net write-off rate for
the second quarter was 2%, down 20 basis points from the year-ago period and consistent with prior quarters. Off to the
right-hand side of this slide, we have our 30-day past due. You'll see that delinquency rates fell 20 basis points, both
sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.
Page six gives another view of the credit quality of our portfolio. We shared this slide with you on previous
discussions. This is data that comes out of the securitization trust issued by us and other competitors. The left-hand side
shows the proportion of balances outstanding with FICO scores below 660, and you'll see that our two trusts: that's the
Charge Trust, American Express Issuance Trust II; and our Credit Card Trust, American Express Master Credit Trust,
have the lowest proportion of their balances in FICO below 660. The right-hand side shows FICO scores in excess of
720 and you see there that our two trusts have the highest percentage of their account balances in those categories.
Page seven gives you a sense of the velocity of spending to outstanding balances on the Master Trust. This is the
payment rate information. We've shown you this information over time, over a rather long time period, over the last
five years. You can see the increasing percentage of our portfolio, which gets paid off every month, and that has been
increasing from below 25% back in June 2008 to in excess of 30% in the most recent quarter. That's a reflection of
consumer decisions to pay off their balances more rapidly than they had previously.
Turning to slide eight, we show our capital management strategy, which really has three different elements to it. One is
we are committed to a strong and flexible balance sheet. Secondly, we do generate capital – have been generating

capital in excess of the needs for funding business growth, and so have been distributing capital as part of our payout
strategy. And our capital allocation decision between retention and distribution is obviously a determinant of our return
on equity as well.
In the next slide on slide nine, we show our most recently reported capital ratios for the second quarter. You'll see here
that our Tier 1 common risk-based ratios declined sequentially by 10 basis points. During the quarter, we generated
roughly $1.7 billion of capital, $1.4 billion from net income and roughly $300 million from different employee benefit
plans – stock-based employee benefit plans.
As we'll show you on the next slide, we've distributed roughly $1.4 billion – $1.7 billion of capital as well, $1.4 billion
through share repurchases and then roughly $300 million through the payment of our quarterly dividend, which was
increased from $0.20 to $0.23 effective in the second quarter. The 10 basis point decline in the Tier 1 common
risk-based capital ratio is attributable to a slight increase in risk-weighted assets sequentially, which is due to both
seasonal factors, as well as that growth in our loan portfolio that I described earlier.
We have now with the Basel III rules in the United States, the capital rules finalized. We do again describe the impact –
the pro forma impact on our Tier 1 common risk-based ratio in the second quarter. Those rules, as we read and interpret
them, would have reduced our Tier 1 common risk-based ratio by roughly 28 basis points. So, the 12.5% would be
reduced by 28 basis points with the full implementation of Basel III as proposed.
We also know that the supplemental leverage ratio in Basel III is a topic of much discussion in the financial press and
among investors. Our pro forma calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio is 8.8%. That is effectively the
leverage ratio – the Tier 1 leverage ratio that we show on slide 9, the 10.5%. The biggest difference between that ratio
and the supplementary leverage ratio is the inclusion of a portion of our open-to-buy credit volumes in our credit
portfolio in the denominator.
Slide 10 shows our percentage of capital returned to shareholders and includes our share repurchase amounts.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.2 billion shares. You remember that our maximum authority under the CCAR
2013 process for calendar year 2013 is up to $4 billion of shares, and then the additional authority in the first quarter of
next year of an additional $1 billion of shares.
What I wanted to do starting on slide 11 was just use the CCAR results that were released back in the first quarter to
help you understand and see the flexibility that we have in our capital management program. This will be important I
think as well as we disclosed to you in the third quarter along with the other CCAR banks, the results of our mid-year
stress test as required under the Dodd-Frank Act as well.
So, slide 11 is from the CCAR results. This is the Fed modeling of our business under their macroeconomic scenarios,
and the assumption about the capital distribution embedded in this set of capital ratios across the CCAR banks is
effectively maintenance of the current dividend without any share repurchase activity in a severe macroeconomic
scenario. So, you'll see that American Express had 11.1% on a Tier 1 common ratio, is among the three highest of the
participating banks on that basis.
When we released our mid-year stress test results prior to the end of the third quarter, we will apply our own
macroeconomic stress scenario, which we will describe to you and our payout assumption will be similar to what you
see on slide 11.
Slide 12 on the other hand takes that macroeconomic scenario, assumes the payment of the regular quarterly dividend,
but adds on the share repurchase and any requests for increases in dividends that were made by the firm. So, you see
that the 11.1% ratio for us declines to 6.4%, somewhat under the median for the group. But, remember that what this
scenario reflects on slide 11 is a severe macroeconomic scenario and the assumption that during that severe
macroeconomic scenario we would continue to repurchase shares according to our capital distribution plan.
If you go back to the financial crisis, one of the levers that we employed in order to continue to maintain a strong
balance sheet was a suspension of the share repurchase activity, and so that's certainly a lever that's available to us if
conditions warrant.

The next three slides just also give you a sense of the strength of our business model in severe macroeconomic
scenarios. Slide 13 shows that we are one of only five participating banks in the CCAR exercise that was cumulatively
profitable over the nine-quarter time horizon.
Slide 14 shows that as a percentage of assets, our pre-provision net revenue that is before credit provision cost is
best-in-class across the CCAR banks.
And then lastly, slide 15 shows for credit card issuers that our cumulative credit card loss rates, and again these are loss
rates that are modeled and disclosed by the Federal Reserve, is lowest among that group. Also worth noting that the
loss rates described here are cumulative loss rates over the nine-quarter time horizon in the CCAR analysis.
Slide 16 describes our funding and liquidity strategy. We have been for the last five years focused on diversifying our
funding sources and our aim is to continue to have scale and relevance in each of three long-term funding markets: the
unsecured term market; the ABS market through our two securitization trusts; and retail deposits.
Our liquidity objective is to be able to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readily marketable securities as well as
contingent sources of liquidity, so that we can meet all of our future financing obligations and business requirements
for at least a 12-month period, including periods when we have no access to the unsecured or secured debt capital
markets, or the ability to raise further deposits.
Our current liquidity target is to make sure that we hold sufficient cash and readily marketable securities to meet all
maturing funding obligations over the next 12 months. The way we think about those maturing funding obligations is
on a consolidated basis and across all of our funding programs. So, this is maturities at the parent company and in all of
the subsidiaries of American Express, it includes the unsecured debt, ABS as well as retail CD funding maturities as
well.
Slide 17 shows that at the end of the second quarter, in fact, we did hold cash and readily marketable securities of $15.4
billion, specifically set aside to cover the $14.4 billion of maturities across CDs, ABS and unsecured term over the next
12 months. The $15.4 billion is a subset of the total cash in the company. You'll note that in the footnote there, that
does not include the $15.4 billion – does not include $7.7 billion of working capital cash that we had on hand at the end
of the second quarter.
Slide 18, reminds you of on a consolidated basis, our principal funding sources as well as our principal sources of
contingent liquidity in times of stress in the capital markets. As indicated our funding sources include deposits to ABS
programs, unsecured debt. We do have some term bank facilities that we use to fund our assets in our company, and
while we have not been a frequent and regular issuer of commercial paper, we do have a program in place to do so and
may issue small amounts of commercial paper from time to time to meet seasonal and other short-term needs.
On the contingent sources, I've reviewed the cash and readily marketable securities we have on our balance sheet. Our
two U.S. banks, American Express Centurion Bank and the Federal Savings Bank, do have access and collateral that's
eligible at the Fed's discount window. And we maintain some committed bank credit facilities in our non-bank
subsidiaries as well.
Plus the bottom of the page, you'll see that we have some secured borrowing through secured financing facilities. These
are attached to our Charge Card Trust as well as our Lending Trust and there in the middle of the page because we will
use them and have used them from time-to-time to fund seasonal and other short-term needs in our business, as well as
they are available as a contingent source, should other sources of liquidity be unavailable to us.
Slide 19, has our capital markets issuance volume to date. You'll see that we've issued $2.6 billion of unsecured debt
and a $600 million of ABS so far this year.
Slide 20, gives you the sequential walk in our total deposit portfolios – retail deposit portfolios. You'll see that total
deposits declined slightly during the quarter from $40.8 billion to $40 billion. We did issue unsecured debt during the
quarter and didn't need all the funding from these deposits. So, you can see under the third-party CDs we had $800
million mature and only replaced $500 million of those. And then in our third-party sweep program, we have $1.7
billion, which we did not – chose not to raise any additional funds. The direct column is personal savings for American

Express, our direct-to-consumer offering of retail deposits and you can see that, that continues to grow and grew during
the quarter by $1.2 billion.
As we've transformed our funding profile, we continue to develop a set of expectations around this that the growth rates
in deposits going forward will be slower than they have been up until this point – lower than they have been up until
this point and be more in line with asset growth than they historically have been.
Slide 21, gives you a time series of our composition of funding and the volume of funding across the four programs that
we have in place. You can see the mix has not changed significantly over the last three years, but compared to 2010, we
do hold a significantly higher percentage of deposits and other forms of debt.
At the bottom of the page, we break out by legal entity which part of that funding composition is embedded in the
Centurion Bank and Federal Savings Bank and which pieces are issued by the other subsidiaries of the company.
Beginning on slide 22, I wanted to walk through and remind you all of our principal issuing entities for unsecured debt
and then just give you a little visibility into each one of those entities, what their business purpose is, what their
maturity ladder looks like, to give you some insight into how our funding strategy actually works across the company.
The slide 22 shows our five principal issuing entities: the parent company; Travel Related Services, I'll talk about each
of these in a minute; American Express Credit Corp, those are the three entities that on the prior page were included in
the non-bank category of outstanding debt; and then our two U.S. banks, Centurion Bank; and the Federal Savings
Bank.
Slide 23, talks about the parent company, which is a bank holding company. It has outstanding today $12.1 billion of
debt and you can see that, that debt is staggered as to maturities over the next several years. And the majority of that
debt matures beyond 2017. The funding raised by the parent company is used for general corporate purposes, and the
sources of funding for the parent company – the primary funding sources, are dividends from subsidiaries and
unsecured long-term notes.
Slide 24 is Travel Related Services, which is also a bank holding company. It does not currently have any debt
outstanding, but it has historically had some medium term notes outstanding and is eligible as an issuer for us, should
the need arise. The uses of those funding for general corporate purposes, and again its funding sources are medium and
long-term notes, as well as it does have access to some of the liquidity raised through our Charge Card Trust, American
Express Issuance Trust II.
Credco is our principal unsecured debt issuing entity. It – uses of funding there are to fund our U.S. and non-U.S.
charge card receivables as well as funding non-U.S. revolving cards. In addition, to the unsecured debt outstanding, its
other funding sources include proceeds from the Charge Card Trust, bank credit facilities that we have drawn across the
globe, inter-company borrowings, and it is the entity that has the commercial paper capacity that we've not used, but is
available to us should a need arise. You can see the funding maturities off to the right of the total $20.7 billion of
unsecured debt, also staggered out over several years.
Slide 26 talks about American Express Centurion Bank. The funding here is to fund consumer charge card including
our lending on charge products, as well as the so-called proprietary lending products. Those are not co-brand products,
for example. Funding sources in the bank include retail deposits, third-party CDs and third-party sweep accounts that I
showed you on the prior page; unsecured medium and long-term notes; proceeds from asset-backed securities issued by
the Credit Account Master Trust; as well as inter-company borrowings; and other short-term money market
instruments. On the right-hand side, you see the funding maturities, both our CD book of $6.8 billion as well as the
unsecured debt issued by Centurion as well.
Federal Savings Bank on slide 27 exists primarily to issue and fund co-brand and our OPEN, that is our small – U.S.
small business services charge as well as revolving products. It has access to retail deposits; it is the issuer of our
personal savings direct deposit program that I described earlier; it also raises deposits through third-party CDs and
third-party sweep arrangements; it issues medium and long-term notes, participates in the Lending Trust securitization;
and also has inter-company borrowings and short-term money market instrument capacity available to it. Its funding

maturities are relatively small at $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion and we give you the maturity ladders there.
Slide 28 is the Lending Trust, which was established in 1996. It currently has total loans of $29.6 billion and
outstanding certificates of investor interest of $17 billion as well as seller's interest of $12.6 billion. You can see the
funding maturities there by calendar year as well on slide 28.
Slide 29 is the American Express Issuance Trust; AEIT and AEITT, which was recently established. We did our first
issuance from AEITT earlier this year. You can see that as a five-year deal due in 2018.
Slide 30 gives you the term maturity profile, including certificates of deposit on a consolidated basis, both at the end of
June as well as the end of last year, to show you the change that's occurred in the last six months as a result of the
issuance and maturity activities.
With that, let me conclude with a few final comments. We continue to feel positive about our performance, especially
given the relatively slow growth economic environment. During the quarter, spend growth continued to be healthy and
was relatively consistent with past several quarters.
We saw average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpaced the industry. At the same time, lending
loss rates remain near all time lows. We continued to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through
dividends and buybacks, while maintaining strong capital ratios. This strength in our balance sheet puts us in an
excellent position to meet our ongoing business requirements and make investments in the business. Our access to
diversified sources of funding, our cash position and cash flow and liquidity profile prepare us well for uncertain times.
We recognize our business is not immune to the economic environment, but continue to believe that the flexibility of
our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our stakeholders, even in a slow growth environment.
Thanks for listening and Ken and I are now ready to take any questions you might have.

Okay. It comes from the line of [ph] Ryan Douglas from Citigroup (32:31). Please go ahead.
<Q>: Hi. I had a quick question on the guidance for issuance for 2013. I believe it was $4 billion to $10 billion that was
mentioned at the end of 2012, and I was just checking to see if that remains the guidance for this year and as it is offset
by $2.6 billion so far year-to-date issuance.
<A - David L. Yowan>: So, [ph] Ryan (32:58), thanks. We don't update that guidance during the year.

<Q>: Okay. Just another question in addition to that would be for potential issuance, could you give us a flavor about
what your thoughts are for tenors or mix of issuance, in terms of currencies and so forth?
<A - David L. Yowan>: I think if you look historically, the majority of our unsecured debt issuance and our ABS
issuance is in the three or five year tenors. Some of the longer-term debt we've issued at the parent company as the
maturity ladder there indicates, but our – I think our historical pattern you've seen us issue in three and five years most
frequently. The majority of our unsecured debt is issued in U.S. dollars. We have issued and have maintained a
Canadian MTM program as you know, and have issued in non-U.S. dollar currencies from time to time when
conditions warrant that. And so, we do have the flexibility to do that, but the bulk of our issuance activity, certainly
historically, has been in U.S. dollars.
