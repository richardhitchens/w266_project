And now I'd like to introduce QUALCOMM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Paul Jacobs.
Paul E. Jacobs
Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone.
We're off to a solid start in fiscal 2014, and we're pleased to report record revenues this quarter driven by strong growth
in both QCT and QTL. Steve will provide more color on the businesses, but I did want to comment on the executive
changes we recently announced.
First I'm extremely pleased that Steven Mollenkopf will become our next Chief Executive Officer. He's an exceptional
leader with a stellar track record over his 20 years at QUALCOMM. Throughout his tenure, he's played a critical role
in developing a number of new technologies and strengthening our relationships with our industry partners. This
change will ensure management continuity, will allow me to work on new technologies and help set the future direction
for the company as Executive Chairman of the Board. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Steve and the
rest of the management team.
Secondly, I wanted to thank our employees, customers and suppliers for their support over my tenure as CEO. We've
seen tremendous change over the last almost nine years. When I began my service as CEO, we were predominately
known as the CDMA2000 company. Fast forward to today and we've developed a broadly licensed and diversified
portfolio of technologies, not only from an air interface perspective but also in many other mobile technologies, such as
computing and connectivity, with an industry leading approach of integrating these core technologies that define the
mobile experience.
Looking back, we had a vision for what a smartphone could be, and we worked together with our partners to bring this
vision to reality. It really dates back to the early 1990s when we had the idea to put the Internet protocols into CDMA.
We really knew that data would unlock tremendous opportunities for mobile devices. We were the first to put GPS in
phones. We developed the first Palm OS-based smartphone. We were pioneers in the mobile app space with our Brew
app store, and continued to lead with innovations such as first gigahertz smartphone processor and obviously more
recently, advanced multimedia technology such as Ultra HD video capture and playback.
Looking forward the opportunities are vast. We work with our partners to help them expand their data capacity by up to
a thousand -fold with solutions such as our small cells and other innovations such LTE and unlicensed spectrum. We're
helping to drive adoption of mobile technologies into several exciting new categories including automotive, healthcare
and the connected home, with our industry-leading, mobile computing connectivity offerings. And the AllSeen
Alliance was recently formed to drive interoperability for the Internet of Everything, which is based on the use of the
AllJoyn software framework.
Now this industry leadership and vision has translated into strong business performance with revenues more than
quadrupling and EPS more than tripling since fiscal 2005. In addition we've returned over $25 billion in capital to
stockholders during this timeframe and recently announced our intent to return 75% of free cash flow to stockholders.
We expect that will more than double the amount of capital returned to stockholders over the next five years as
compared to the last five years.

We continue to be extremely excited about the future, we're still in the early rounds of global smartphone adoption,
we're in the early rounds of the transition to mobile computing. And then we have this broad connection of the Internet
of Everything. So we have the right technologies and more importantly we have the team to execute on these
opportunities ahead. So we're pleased with the start to fiscal 2014. And I look forward to continuing to work with our
team to drive growth in the years ahead.
Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Good afternoon, and thank you, Paul. I appreciate your kind words. I'm humbled and extremely honored to have been
named CEO Elect of QUALCOMM. Under Paul's tenure as CEO, the company has established a leadership position in
3G, 4G and next generation wireless technologies, developed a deep and diverse set of industry-leading mobile
technologies and has generated extraordinary results. We are well positioned to address the significant opportunities
ahead and I look forward to guiding the company during its next phase of growth.
Paul, I'd like to thank you for your leadership and mentorship. And I look forward to continuing to work closely with
you in the years ahead. I am proud to have been given this opportunity and I look forward to assuming the CEO role in
March.
Turning to our fiscal first quarter, our QTL and QCT delivered strong financial results and we are off to a solid start to
fiscal 2014. In the quarter we also returned approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and buy-back
activity, consistent with the increased capital return targets we outlined in November. QTL had a strong quarter, in line
with our expectations with revenue and earnings before tax up 8% and 9% respectively year-over-year. Total reported
device sales by our licensees was a record and above the midpoint of our prior guidance range.
Global smartphone adoption continues to be a key driver of royalty revenue growth and in the fiscal first quarter we
saw increased sequential shipments by our licensees of smartphones in emerging regions. According to Gartner,
emerging region smartphone shipments are expected to grow at close to 30% CAGR between 2012 and 2017. Globally,
Gartner expects approximately 7 billion smartphones to be shipped from 2013 to 2017.
In QCT, revenues and MSM shipments were up 12% and 17% year-over-year respectively. MSM shipments were
above our expectations, driven by demand in emerging regions. Actions taken to manage spending contributed to better
than expected operating margins. From an operating expense standpoint our outlook for moderated, year-over-year
growth remains on track. We are still investing in both the core businesses and new business opportunities. And with
our expense management initiatives this year, we continue to forecast that we will exit fiscal 2014 at a lower operating
expense run rate for the company than we exited fiscal 2013.
Turning to China, we are pleased to see that the 4G spectrum licenses have now been issued. We are working closely
with the operators as well as domestic and international OEMs to meet this new growth opportunity. We continue to
add single mode OFDMA licensees including in China. Given the high degree of similarity between the TDD and FDD
modes of the international LTE standard and our position as the leading contributor to LTE, the royalties payable by
our licensees under their single mode OFDMA licenses are the same for devices that implement either or both of the
TDD and FDD modes of LTE.
QUALCOMM continues to invest heavily in developing the leading and the most widely licensed portfolio of patented
technologies applicable to 3G and 4G devices. For QCT, the growth of LTE, FDD and TDD in China aligns with our
strengths. Both from supporting local Chinese OEMs looking to leverage LTE and build their business outside of China
as well as global OEMs hoping to leverage LTE growth to grow their businesses in China.
For each of these customer types, our multi-mode 3G LTE modem leadership and Snapdragon solutions combined with
our ability to support global launches, position us well. We have over 70 3G LTE multi-mode designs with the leading
Chinese OEMs based on our Snapdragon 400 Chipsets for the high volume handset tier. We believe the recently
announced Snapdragon 410 with integrated LTE will also be the world's first 64-bit processor for the high volume tier

and will establish our 64-bit leadership there.
On a legal front, as we previously announced in November, the Chinese National Development and Reform
Commission or NDRC notified us that it had commenced an investigation of us related to the Chinese anti-monopoly
law. The NDRC has advised us that the substance of the investigation is confidential. We will continue to cooperate
with the NDRC as it conducts its investigation.
Globally, the momentum of Snapdragon-based devices continues to grow with over 1,350 designs announced or
shipping and more than 500 designs in the pipeline, including over 40 tablets. We are pleased with our design activity
and anticipate good volume growth in flagship tablets such as the new LG G Pad tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro,
and the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro announced at CES.
Looking ahead, our newly announced next generation chipsets are progressing well and continue to demonstrate our
leadership. The Snapdragon 805 sets a new bar for performance in premium tablets and smartphones with end-to-end
Ultra HD capability and the world's fastest mobile CPU. It is on track to ship in commercial devices in the first half of
this calendar year and will help our customers take advantage of the increasing interest in Ultra HD across the
entertainment and consumer electronics industries.
Our new 9x35 modem delivers our fourth generation of LTE and is on track to extend our LTE leadership into
Category 6. We have already demonstrated the world's first 300 megabits per second LTE Category 6 data session on
Ericsson infrastructure and we expect to see our Category 6 modem in data cards, hot spots and smartphones this year.
Our overall Wi-Fi sales are strong and growing with unit sales this quarter up 50% year-over-year. And we have over
200 designs of our premium 802.11ac solution in the pipeline. Our RF 360 family of products also continues to
progress well. Our Envelope Tracking solution has been shipping for a number of months and is in key devices such as
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, the Google Nexus 5 and the LTE Nubia 5S.
Our dynamic antenna tuner recently launched in Nokia's flagship Lumia 1520 and our remaining RF 360 products are
on track to ship later this fiscal year as expected. In closing, we are off to a solid start in the first fiscal quarter and we
see the year developing broadly in line with our previous expectations.
That concludes my remarks. And I would now like to turn the call over to George Davis.
George S. Davis
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.
Our first quarter results came in above expectations on solid operating performance and the positive net impact of
certain discrete items. Fiscal first quarter revenues were a record $6.6 billion, up 10% year-over-year and non-GAAP
earnings per share was $1.26, above our prior guidance range. Our results this quarter included a $665 million gain or
$0.25 per share related to the sale of substantially all of our Omnitracs business.
We also recorded a $444 million impairment or $0.20 per share in Other expenses related to the fab assets in our QMT
business. The remaining items in Other expenses impacted results by an additional $0.01 per share. In total, these items
added a net $0.04 per share gain to results and excluding these items our non-GAAP EPS would be $1.22 per share or
$0.07 above the midpoint of guidance and $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. Results in QCT and in our
treasury portfolio were the major contributors to above-expectation performance.
In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensee were a record $61.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year and above the
midpoint of our guidance range, with an average selling price of $222 at the midpoint and shipments of 278 million
3G/4G-based devices at the midpoint. We saw strength in both emerging and developed regions with increased
penetration of smartphones into lower tiers. Emerging regions continue to show the highest unit growth rates for
3G/4G-based devices.

QCT earnings before tax were above expectations with record revenues of $4.6 billion and record shipments of 213
million MSMs. Revenue per MSM was lower sequentially, reflecting higher mix of thin modems and increased MSM
shipments for emerging regions. QCT operating margin was 20% in the fiscal first quarter, above our prior
expectations, reflecting actions to manage spending in the quarter.
For the company overall, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were below our guidance, decreasing 3%
sequentially primarily driven by our QCT business.
Turning to capital structure, during the fiscal first quarter we returned approximately $1.6 billion to stockholders,
including approximately $600 million of dividends paid and $1 billion in stock repurchases. As of the end of the first
fiscal quarter, we had approximately $3.8 billion remaining of the $5 billion stock repurchase authorization announced
in September of last year.
Cash flow from operations was very strong again this quarter at approximately $2.8 billion or 42% of revenues. Timing
of shipments in Q4 and Q1 led to a higher than normal reduction in receivables, which was the major factor in our
above-trend working capital and cash flow performance. We ended the fiscal quarter with cash and marketable
securities of $31.6 billion.
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2014. Our outlook for the fiscal year is mostly unchanged. But we are increasing
our earnings per share guidance to adjust for the above-expectation performance in the fiscal first quarter, modestly
tempered by a somewhat softer outlook in our fiscal second quarter. We expect fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per
share to be in the range of $5.00 to $5.20, up approximately 13% year-over-year at the midpoint relative to 2013, and
up $0.05 at the midpoint from our prior guidance.
As it is still very early in the year, we are also holding our forecast for calendar 2014 3G/4G-based device shipments.
However, we do see some potential upside to our forecast, particularly related to LTE deployment in China. We are
also holding the midpoint of our calendar 2013 3G/4G device shipment estimate, although modestly narrowing the
range. As we outlined in November, we forecast improving trends in the second half of our fiscal year versus the first
half. We expect higher device ASPs for QTL and a better mix of leading parts in QCT, including the impact of LTE in
China. We also continue to forecast favorable trends in product costs.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $6.1 to $6.7 billion, flat
to up approximately 9% year-over-year. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal second quarter to be
approximately $1.15 to $1.25 per share, up 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate second fiscal quarter
non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be slightly higher, up 1% to 3% sequentially, reflecting modest
growth in R&D. In QTL we estimate total reported device sales of $66.5 to $72.5 billion will be reported by our
licensees in the March quarter for shipments that they made in the December quarter, up approximately 14%
year-over-year at the midpoint, reflecting the busy holiday season. We estimate that the QTL device ASP will be
relatively flat sequentially.
In QCT we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 180 to 195 million units during the March quarter, down 12%
at the midpoint sequentially, and up approximately 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. And we expect revenue per
MSM to be up modestly on mix quarter-over-quarter. We expect QCT operating margin to be approximately 15% in
the fiscal second quarter, lower sequentially, as expected, reflecting the impact of lower seasonal volumes and the
effects of annual pricing resets typical for this time of year. We continue to forecast QCT operating margins to be 18%
to 20% for the full fiscal year.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - Tim Long>: Thank you. A two-parter on the royalty line if I could. Maybe could you give us an update, it looks
like again the calculated rate went down a little bit more. Was there anything in there? Are we hitting more caps with
what's going on with that?
And then secondly, if we could just get your perspective on China, collecting in China, particularly as it seems like
there's been a lot more three mode products being announced relative to the five mode. Do you think that changes the
dynamic at all in collecting with the Chinese OEMs? Thank you.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Hey Tim, this is Derek. So on the rate question, I think again we've kind of gone through a
number of times all the factors that move this thing around. This quarter it's sort of a combination probably of a few
things. The TRDS obviously was up again, you know another record. So again we get a little bit of a drag based on the
fixed elements of the revenue. Also I think just given sort of the timing of the product launches there was some
discounting going on during this quarter that impacted the deductions that our licensees take. And so that has also an
impact, as I explained in New York a couple months ago, and then a little bit of OEM mix again, so a number of things
bouncing around.
I do think based on the visibility we have into next quarter that the rate should improve some into next quarter. We still
believe kind of the range that we gave for the year is still what we think we're going to end up in, and that was, I think,
3.1 to 3.3.
On China, really I think not much of a change from, again, what we went through in New York. Again, we're very
active. We're continuing to negotiate agreements on single mode OFDM in China and we added some additional
licensees to the mix here over the last quarter. We've got a number of other discussions ongoing and expect some other
agreements to get signed here hopefully in the next couple of months. So I think we're just continuing to do the work
that we started several years ago to make sure we're in a position to collect and still feel comfortable that that will be
the case.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike Walkley>: Great. Thank you. Paul, I just wanted to say congratulations on a great job of navigating some
tough times as CEO with all those renegotiations a few years back. And Steve, I just wanted to ask a question to you
about the QCT operating margins. It dropped to the mid-teens here in Q1 just on the seasonality. But can you talk about
how you feel on the cost optimization programs and some of the steps that give you comfort in the recovery in the
second half of the year? Thank you.
<A - Paul E. Jacobs>: Thanks a lot. I certainly hope we don't see anything like that for Steve starting off his tenure. It
was – I think a lot of people decided that was time to test our management team. And it wasn't the most fun thing to go
through, but it was good to get it behind us and also to see with all the stuff that's going on in the world in terms of
litigation that we're not in the middle of a lot of that stuff. We're actually partners with a lot of those companies that we
had battles with in the old days. So it's nice to see that change. But thanks for saying that.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Mike this is Steve. With respect to the Op margin, if I looked at the year, particularly if
I looked at the year kind of first half, second half, it's unfolding basically the way that we thought. I think Q1 was
pretty strong, and I think particularly strong actually in the emerging markets, which we were pleased to see. So I think

we are still confident in our outlook in terms of Op margin guidance that we gave in November. Just pleased to have a
good quarter in the book in order to head our direction. As you know, there's always some seasonality in this quarter. I
don't think you're seeing anything more than that really in what you're seeing in the outlook.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hi, guys. I have two questions. First is, what was the impact of foreign exchange on the numbers in
the guidance or – if you could explain even the broader picture of hedging and the impact on the P&L?
And then secondly, when I look at the numbers of – your numbers for next quarter, they are below Street expectations
somewhat. When I look at your numbers for the year, you brought them up. And that means that you expect a second
half recovery in EPS or second half recovery in the trends. Could you go over the reasons for second half acceleration
versus the previous expectations and what stands behind the increase in EPS? Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: Sure. This is George. Let me start off with the FX impact. We had a modestly positive impact
in the first quarter. As you know, it's really – most of our exposure comes from our licensing business. And we have
hedging programs in place to help us with that. We expect the full year, again, to be modestly positive after our hedging
programs. But FX has not been a major impact for us over the last couple years.
In terms of the quarter – second quarter and the full year, really actually the year is pretty much playing out in line with
our expectations, a little bit more positive in the first quarter, but we're seeing a little more softness in the second
quarter.
Net-net, the first half looks about – as we said in the second half, it really – we're not calling for anything other than the
same environment that we expected going into the year. We have said that we think that whether you're looking at
devices or you're looking at potential sales around the world, China LTE looks like an area where depending on the
timing, there might be some benefit -more benefit that hits our fiscal year, which as you know closes out a quarter
before the calendar year.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Yeah, guys, a couple of them. So at the beginning of the call you talked about being in the early
rounds of smartphone adoption and growth. Can you give a little more color around that, kind of looking at what we're
seeing from a maturation standpoint in places like the U.S. but growth in the emerging markets? And how do you see
that playing out in terms of your ASP trends?
Second question, Steve, each of your main competitors in LTE in the last nine months has gone outside their company
to acquire technology to try to compete with you in that market and none of them have really come to market with a
product of any scale. Can you talk about what you see for LTE competition in the year?
And then, Paul, just briefly can you give us a rundown on some of your focuses in terms of your venture ideas or
venture investments as you move on to your next role? Thank you.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Brian, this is Derek. Let me answer your first question. I think obviously we look at the
market as a whole, which we break up kind of in developed and emerging regions. While it's true that there is a fair
amount of maturation of smartphone adoption in the developed regions, we do still think that there's a lot of things
coming that will drive replacement cycles there and then bring the last bit of the tail over. But then when you look at
emerging regions, there's still a huge runway for growth there. So I think when we look at it in totality, although the
areas where we probably spend most of our time seems like the smartphone space is well penetrated, there's still a huge

opportunity for us in the emerging regions.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Brian, this is Steve. On LTE, yeah, I think what we have seen – there are a lot of folks
obviously working on LTE. We are continuing to see strong design-in activity. I think what's happening, we have an
early lead. We're driving it across tiers and at the same time the feature set is turning over. And one of the things that
has been important for us since day one of our LTE solution, we've had the TDD mode in there. That's been, I think,
exceedingly important in terms of being able to grow our business into China, which is a good thing.
But also, what we're seeing in China is the effect where people want to use the LTE solution that, number one, has
maturity and feature leadership, but also gives them the ability to deliver a product outside of China and to become a
global smartphone OEM and not just a regional smartphone OEM.
So I think we're continuing to stay ahead of people in terms of technology and certainly maturity and scale. But the
things that we bring seem to also be more important as well. So we hope that continues. We're going to continue to
invest in that area as has been our practice.
<A - Paul E. Jacobs>: So in terms of stuff that I'm going to go look at in the future, obviously there's a whole set of
projects that we have going on right now. I just think it will be nice to be able to spend a little bit more time hands on
with those projects and hopefully can help accelerate some of those coming to market.
And then sort of farther out stuff that we haven't talked a lot about yet, everybody's talking about 5G already. So I think
we have some good ideas for what 5G should be and the kinds of things that it should do in addition to just being faster
and more spectrum and more bandwidth and those things. So I've got some good projects ahead of me.

Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thanks very much. And I wanted to congratulate both of you, Paul and Steve, on the
new roles. I just wanted to ask you first about your guidance as it pertains to QTL and device sales in particular. It was
relatively strong even though we've seen some of the major OEMs actually come in with slightly lower than expected
results for the December quarter. So I was just wondering if you can go into some of the drivers for that. Is it emerging
markets? Is it tablets or any other categories?
And then relative to your unit guidance for MSM chipsets in the March quarter, it's a bit below seasonal. And I just
wanted to dig into that a little more, if it's anything to do with market share or inventory or end demand if you can just
give us a bit of color there as well? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Simona, this is Derek. Why don't I start and if George wants to jump in and add something he
can? As you know we, at this stage of the game, we get a fair amount of visibility in from our licensees typically before
we provide guidance. So we do have a reasonable amount of confidence in the guide that we've provided for the
December quarter sales.
I think it's again a blending. We see a lot of strength in the emerging regions, continue to see strength in places like
China. And although there was a little softness, I think, in the U.S. some of the other developed regions continue to do
well such as Europe. And I think a little – we're going to probably see a little stronger tablet uptake as well and there's
some evidence of that coming out of some of the statements Verizon and AT&T made this last week.
<A - George S. Davis>: So on the MSM front, I think what we're seeing and it's one of the reasons why we didn't up
the number for MSMs for the full year, we think some of the benefit that we saw in Q1 were MSMs that were being
pulled in, so maybe a little bit of a timing issue between Q2 and Q1. But again, overall the first half of the year looks
very much like we thought it would and second half the same, so probably not a lot of news in those numbers.

Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Yeah. Thanks a lot. You basically reiterated guidance for the full year revenues, but the year is
turning out to be a little more backend loaded than I was thinking. June is historically flat, which if that plays out again,
would imply that September is up north of 10% sequentially. Is that the right way to think about the rest of the year?
That's my first question.
And then second, Steve, China Mobile indicated, I believe, in December that they expect to sell 100 million LTE
devices. That number seems like it's overstated, but wanted to get your thoughts on that. Thank you.
<A - George S. Davis>: So on the first half, second half, again all I can say is it really -- and we spent some time on
this in the original guidance. The year does look a little bit different than the historical pattern with more of the
earnings coming in the second half. We still believe that is the case and also you get a slightly higher revenue rate in
the second half of the year. So I think in terms of any specific quarter, it's too early to comment beyond our second
quarter guidance. But that's why when we raised our guidance it really was more just to reflect the outperformance in
Q1 than a fundamental change in first half and second half.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And this is Steve, on the China Mobile forecast for devices, my guess is if I remember
correctly, that was a calendar year number. But, you know, and it's difficult for me to comment on the numbers, but I
will say that the intensity with which the industry is getting prepared for the launch of LTE is quite high and if you look
at our design-in intensity and you look at the preparations that we're going through with the carriers, it is consistent
with a big launch of that scale. Now it's always difficult, as we've said before, to pick when those things happen and the
start of a new launch is always difficult to pick, particularly as early as it is. But we expect that to be a big, pretty
significant launch when it occurs, and we're getting prepared for it.

Next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citi. Please go ahead with your question
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Hey, guys. I appreciate it. Thanks. A question for you on China. Is there any reason that
China Mobile having said their going to stress three mode phones rather than five mode, is there any reason the royalty
rate on a three mode phone would be different than on a five mode phone? Obviously there's some difference because
of the lack of 3G. But, if you can give us a sense as to the difference between those two?
And on that note then also, if the share of TD-LTE at China Mobile ends up being let's say roughly similar share wise
to what 3G looks like right now in China, given that you count a lot of the major Chinese players like Huawei, ZTE,
Lenovo and Coolpad as good customers of yours, and I presume therefore paying you whatever royalty they do pay
you, if they end up getting the similar shares in the TD-LTE world as that develops, can you give us a sense as to what
would that mean for the royalty rates that you would collect on LTE?
And then you made a comment, Steve, I think, that there's a higher percentage of thin modems sold, or George you may
have said that, thin modems sold this quarter, and that's what affected the ASP on your MSMs. Is that a trend you're
seeing of non-integrated chips in smartphones, or is that an indication that 3G/4G feature phones are making a
comeback? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Ehud, this is Derek. Let me answer your first question. So you know, we've talked a lot about
some of the challenges we've had with collecting on TD-SCDMA in China, and the things that we've been doing to sort
of either push things like five-mode so that there's WCDMA in the device or also the move to LTE should be a good
one for us. And so our 3G deals would cover anything that you called a five-mode. And in fact in many cases, would
cover the phones that are three-mode. So absent the challenges we've had around TD-SCDMA, we wouldn't really have
a need to negotiate new deals on those.

But like I said, we are signing a number of companies to the LTE licenses and so as we've talked about, we do expect
the rate on what we call the single-mode LTE device to be lower than 3G. Although I spent some time going through
that in New York, if you recall, in terms of trying to explain the delta between the 3G and 4G royalty picture kind of as
a whole based on the companies that were signed up so far. So maybe you can kind of go back and think about that.
I can't really specifically comment on any particular licensee or any particular agreement. And obviously we're going
have to see how the market develops in terms of three-mode versus five-mode adoption and who are the suppliers that
get share moving forward.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Ehud, this is Steve. So just one follow-up on that question by the way. I think what
you're going to see in China Mobile, because it's so big and because the launch is likely to happen across tiers, you're
going get a lot of attraction from international OEMs using their LTE expertise worldwide to exploit that technology
change. At the same time, I think you're going to see domestic OEMs looking to leverage their strength in China to be
international OEMs. Both of those trends we think are positive to our core businesses, which I think is important.
With respect to your high – to the number about the thin modems, I don't think there's really a trend there. You could
say the vast majority of our Chipsets are actually shipped as integrated. And that's really what most people do in the
industry. What you're probably seeing is just sort of a concentration of some of the OEMs that use thin modems and
how that might be associated with particular phone launches and the timing of those phone launches through the year as
opposed to a trend.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all, I just wanted to dig in a little bit.
You're guiding QTL ASPs for December shipments flattish. You saw upside on chipsets, though, that shipped in the
December quarter from the low end. How do I reconcile those two things, upside from chipsets in December low end
versus guidance for device shipments in December ASPs flattish?
Secondly, in the current quarter, the quarter that just passed, you had ASPs down but a lot of unit upside, which would
imply a lot of growth at the lower end. What does that actually imply for continued QRD traction? I think you had said
last year the revenues in QRD were in the ballpark of $1 billion. Do we read into the results that we just saw continued
traction with QRD or more traction with QRD than we've had?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Stacy, this is Derek. I think part of this might be a little bit of timing in terms of the chip
shipments versus when the devices actually get sold into the market and reported to us. But we do see some strength in
the emerging regions really driving the Q4 results as well. And the ASP, I think, as we said last quarter we expected to
sort of be kind of in line in the calendar Q4 quarter versus Q3. That's what we're expecting. We do expect the back half
of the year, which is consistent I think with what we've seen the last three years, to be stronger from an ASP
perspective just given the timing of some of the iconic product launches we expect to see here shortly.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Stacy, this is Steve. Regarding the QRD, I think it was another good quarter for our
emerging accounts. I would probably categorize that group of accounts. A lot of them use the QRD, but this is really a
new channel that we had to develop over the years and a strong quarter for them in the December quarter. We expect
that to continue to be a good channel for us moving forward, something we can also use our LTE leadership into as
well. We are pleased to be able to see the upside there.

<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple for you, I just wanted to go back to
China and see if you guys could talk about two more things there. One is, maybe Derek, can you give us any idea what
proportion of the potential LTE volume is licensed or some idea how far through the licensing process for LTE you are
there?
And then also, maybe George, you could comment or someone could comment on this antitrust ruling in China, how
that plays out. Are you accruing for a potential fine there? When do we get more, I guess, firmed up in terms of what
the impact might be financially from that?
And then lastly, Paul, I just wanted to ask you could you give us update on 1000x and where that is? I know you guys
had thought you might have some trials this year. I just wonder how that's progressing along and whether we will see
some trials on that this year? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: So Rod, this is Derek. A little bit of a hard question to answer, but let me give it a shot. I think
we have signed more than 50, I think it's more than 55 companies now to LTE licenses in China. But actually I think a
large part of the volume initially here will be stuff that is actually covered by our 3G deals. Certainly the volumes that
go to China Telecom, China Unicom, the 5-mode volumes at China Mobile. And then also, as Steve mentioned, the
international volumes that will be coming in to China likely will be of the same flavor. And so it's going to depend –
like I said, we're continuing to be in discussions and sign additional companies as we speak. And so again I think we're
on track to doing the things we need to do. I just, without knowing exactly who's going have what share and how this is
all going to play out I can't really give you any more granularity than that.
<A - Donald J. Rosenberg>: Rod, it's Don and George may want to add something, but just to be clear, you talked
about an antitrust ruling. There isn't any ruling in China. The articles that you read are speculating at this point. There's
an investigation. We've talked about that. We've been told by the NDRC that it's confidential. We are cooperating with
them and we're going to continue to cooperate with them. So at this point, anything that anybody is saying is pure
speculating at this point while this proceeds.
<A - Paul E. Jacobs>: On the 1000x, obviously I don't want to announce other people's products. We're supplying the
technology. We've obviously done a number of our own trials based off of our own products, but the traction with the
customer base is good. So I feel confident that that's continuing to move along. And there's obviously a lot of dynamics
in the operator market between operators who have a lot of spectrum, operators who have fixed network capabilities.
And so there are certain ones who will be, I'd say, more the leaders, and we're focused on driving the opportunity with
those people, but it will be done through customers of ours who will deliver the products.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. Just a couple of questions, if I can, on the addressable market growth for the
overall business, the 15%, also unit growth you guys are talking about, you mentioned, I think, George, earlier on just
that you saw more upside to that number. I guess the things that we've heard suggest otherwise in the sense that you've
had a number of large handset smartphone vendors disappoint near-term on volumes, gave relatively cautious guidance,
and I understand the upside in China. But equally China Mobile's network is only really running out now. It may take
some time. The service pricing seems a bit on the expensive side. So I'm still kind of curious that there seems to be
more kind of downside risk than three or four months ago, given those things we've learned than before. So what is it
you're seeing that gives you the confidence that actually could surprise on the upside as we go through this year? That's
my first question on the addressable market and the confidence you have in that growth rate.
And then, for Steve, is it the case that I think when you initially were rolling out LTE chips that they were meaningfully
accretive to your ASP, either because of just the technology, the competition, as well as the fact that you were selling
more integrated devices and higher-end Snapdragon chips? As we go through this year, will that level of accretion still
hold or do you guys have to become more aggressive even if your peers aren't as competitive just to kind of ensure that

you really dominate that segment? How do you think about managing the business between those various levers?
Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: Sure. Let me start off with the size of the market and the outlook for 2014. I tried to leave the
message that, if anything, we have a bias to the upside in these numbers. I think sometimes in the year-over-year
comparison when you see the U.S. coming in a little bit softer than people may have expected, it's easy to lose track of
the very high growth rates, certainly well above 15%, 20%-type growth rates in emerging markets. And you're also
seeing actually developed markets maintain overall their growth rates similar to what we saw 2012 to 2013 because
you're seeing on a year-over-year comparison more strength in both Europe and Japan. And while the rates may not be
comparable to emerging market growth rates there on a year-over-year basis, they contribute to our outlook. So – and
then the upside, we would assign to how the LTE deployment in China plays out.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: With respect to LTE pricing, so you should really think of LTE as a tiered offering.
And in the leadership tier, the high tier, we continue to – it's a strong area for our pricing. We continue to have
leadership there. We continue to drive there. But we expect the lower tier or more the entry-level LTE feature set to be
important. And we assume that that's going to be – have to be priced at a different pricing level than what we would at
the leadership tier.
I would also just generally say that I think that the scale that will be built up in this – in the LTE world will also spread
to the developing market as well and provide, I think, some positive view on chipset ASPs relative to what you see
really in more commoditized 3G pricing in terms of the 3G chipsets. LTE, I think, is definitely a tier. It's something that
globally provides kind of an upward trend in terms of pricing for us relative to what you would see in 3G.

Next question comes from the line of Mark McKechnie with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark McKechnie>: Great. Thanks guys. A couple of quick questions. You might have answered these before,
but the chip QCT, you're looking at ASPs or pricing for those to track up in the March quarter? Maybe you can explain
that a bit, some of the drivers.
And then for George, some housekeeping type questions on your guidance. Specifically how much interest income?
There was a pretty big differential. You did like $255 million of interest other expense. I usually wouldn't dwell on that,
but that was a pretty big mover for earnings. Any assumptions or can you give us a sense for what you're assuming on
your guidance for the full year on that line item? Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hi, Mark. Thanks. I'll start with your last question first, and then I'll get to the QCT ASP. On
investment income, it's one of the things actually the performance in the portfolio that we cited as part of the adder to
the outperformance in the first quarter. As we have been accelerating return of capital, we have a portfolio that has a
broad range of risk. And so we're starting to take that risk level down as we draw down more cash for repurchase. And
so you're seeing some gains embedded in the quarter associated with that. And again, maybe I would say above trend,
maybe $0.02, $0.03 from that. I wouldn't count on that every quarter. That's really more a function of just making sure
that we keep the risk level in the portfolio in the right place.
For QCT, really what you're seeing is a little bit of a reversal of what you saw in Q1, which is that the mix, particularly
of thin modems, will not be quite as high a percent. That gives a natural lift to the ASP.

full year guide excluded that sale. I just wanted to make sure we're talking apples-to-apples.
Secondly, a question for Derek. It's been an interesting trend. Nokia has now sold their business and kept the patents.
Ericsson did the same and now Google's doing the same. What I'm wondering is, does that change the competitive
dynamic of QTL at all having multiple patent pools out there that aren't associated with devices? Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: Let me cover the housekeeping. As we said, the Omni gain was always going to be in
non-GAAP. But when we gave guidance, we treated it as a discrete item. So we guided excluding the discrete items.
We also had another major discrete item which was the impairment on the QMT asset. So the net effect of that was
$0.05, and then there was about another penny of items in Other, so a net $0.04 benefit. That's how when we talked
about it would be our performance would have been $1.22 if not for those, which is really the comparable
apples-to-apples that you're looking for. So still $0.02 above the upper end of the guidance range and $0.07 over the
midpoint.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Tavis, this is Derek. I don't think it really changes the competitive dynamic for QTL for our
business. We've obviously been very successful in establishing a value for our own portfolio in the marketplace. And
the fact that other companies may decide to come in and become more active doesn't really impact our value
proposition, per se.
Both Ericsson and Nokia have had active licensing programs for many years. And the way that they've positioned and
valued their patents won't simply change based on whether they have an active business. Now it might change any
individual deal based on the relative exposure. But again, they've been active, and I don't think they'll be a major
disruption or impact in the industry as a result of it.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark Sue>: Thank you. Paul, it's a matter of time before the smartphone market matures, and it's one of the
reasons that the stock multiple [indiscernible] (54:35) the last few years. As we look out over the next few years, what
do you think will replace the smartphone market in terms of opportunities where QUALCOMM can really dominate
similar to what they did in smartphones? If we look at tablets for example, the attach rates have been low because of
the pricey data plans. Auto seems like a niche opportunity. Just maybe how we should think about it longer term?
And then George, as growth matures for the company and the free cash flow improves, any thoughts on your
preference between the steer between dividends and also share repurchase? And longer term, can that 75% return move
higher so that we can actually decompress the stock multiples?
<A - Paul E. Jacobs>: I think we're going to do better and better in the computing space. And I agree that it's been not
as successful as we had hoped in the past in terms of attach rates. I think the operators are getting better at that. We're
also building other technologies, obviously LTE and the license bands do, I think, a lot. Some of the small cell stuff
should do a lot there. But the other part is just mobile as an enabling technology into other areas. You can see the
beginnings of things, Automotive space, yeah those numbers are relatively small. But, people talk about the Internet of
Everything as only low value, low margin devices and I think there's going be a tiering of different kinds of devices.
So there will be high value segments in the Internet of Everything. There will be also the, sort of the very cheap ones
,but then we're talking about high volumes also. So there's going be some growth there. And then you look out and
there's a bunch of areas where we can do things that are just adjacent to the phone, additional content in the phone.
Obviously to this point, the display investments have been not as quick to come to fruition as we had hoped, although I
think the wearable space is a really interesting part. Also connected home space is quite interesting.
So a lot of opportunity for that going forward. We have some other display technologies as well that are getting a lot of
traction with the Pixtronix technology, which is more applicable to larger displays. And that's a nice licensing business.
We've got a bunch of other things in the hopper, the vehicle charging. We're looking at working with partners on that in

terms of a larger play there as well. So there's a broad range of technologies out there that we're working on that will
drive, I think, a reasonable amount of growth going forward.
<A - George S. Davis>: Mark, just to answer your questions on the capital structure and return of capital. So what
we've said is that we expect to grow double-digit, top line and bottom line over the next five years and really largely
driven by the core businesses that we see today. And with that, we expect strong cash flow to continue. We're going to
grow the dividend rate ahead of earnings is what we've committed to. We're going to return 75% of global free cash
flow. And so then you'll see a large – what isn't going through dividends will obviously go via share repurchase and as
Steve mentioned in the script, we expect to more than double the return over the next five years from what we returned
in the past five years.

I just wanted to say thanks again to everybody for all the support over the years. And it has been a great run as CEO, I
think both measured by the financial metrics and also by sort of the way we've expanded the business and the way the

expanding impact of mobile and that's – I'm saying that given the background of how much it's already impacted all of
our lives. So it's going be great to be able to refocus some of my energy on innovation. I don't think I'm going be
