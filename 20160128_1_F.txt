Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectation for Ford's future
performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. The most significant
factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key
information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Credit CFO Marion Harris.
Marion Harris
Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll walk you through Ford Credit's
operating highlight, profit and credit and residual loss performance, including our outlook for 2016.
Then, Neil will cover Ford Credit's funding and liquidity as well as Automotive topics including cash, debt, liquidity
and an update on Ford's pension plans. We'll then have some time for Q&A. So let's get started.
Let's turn to Ford Credit 2015 key metrics on slide one. We continue to support Ford's growth by providing financial
products and services to our dealers and customers around the world. Contract volume grew 8% in the quarter and full
year. Managed receivables ended the year at $127 billion, up $14 billion from year-end 2014 and at the top end of our
prior guidance.
Ford Credit had another outstanding quarter with pre-tax profit of $556 million, up $133 million from 2014, and
full-year pre-tax profit at $2.1 billion is up $232 million from 2014. Fourth quarter net income was $352 million and
full-year net income was $1.4 billion. We paid distributions of about $250 million in 2014.
Our purchase policy remains consistent, along with a relentless focus on originations, servicing and collections. As a
result, portfolio performance continues to be robust with loss-to-receivables ratio at the low end of our historical
experience. Managed leverage was 9.5-to-1 at December 31, reflecting U.S. dollar strength and year-end receivables at
the top end of the forecasted range.
We are very pleased with our performance. Our balance sheet and liquidity are strong and we have world-class
customer satisfaction and cost efficiency.
Slide two explains the $133 million improvement from a year ago in Ford Credit's fourth quarter pre-tax profit. The
pre-tax profit improvement is more than explained by favorable volume and mix and higher financing margin. The
favorable volume and mix was driven by growth in all products globally, and the higher financing margin reflects
lower borrowing cost.
Slide three provides an explanation to change in Ford Credit's full-year pre-tax profit compared with 2014. The
improvement is more than explained by favorable volume and mix, driven by growth in all products globally. Higher
credit losses and the translation effect of the stronger U.S. dollar were partial offsets.
The higher credit losses, primarily in North America, reflect reserve increases in 2015 compared with reserve releases
in 2014. Charge-offs were also higher.
For 2016, Ford Credit expects full-year pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2015. Our year-end managed
receivables in the range of $134 billion to $139 billion and managed leverage returning to the upper end of our targeted
range of 8-to-9-to-1. With that, distributions will be dependent upon leverage, which is affected by numerous factors
including receivable balance, net income, and exchange.
On slide four, charge-offs were up from 2014, primarily reflecting higher severities and growth from receivables. The
LTR ratio of 23 basis points remains at the low end of our historical experience. The reserve, as a percent of managed
receivables, was up one basis point and up $63 million on an absolute basis from the year ago. Our credit loss reserve is
based on such factors as historical loss performance, portfolio quality and receivable level.

Slide five outlines the drivers of credit losses in our U.S. retail and lease portfolios. As I said earlier, our origination
practices remain consistent. And as you can see – you could see this in the top-left box as our average placement FICO
scores in the top-left box are very, very consistent. With that, we continue to experience very robust credit loss
performance.
Our repossession ratio of 98 basis points in 2015 was the lowest on record. And our over 60-day delinquencies was also
a record low. On the other hand, severities have increased over the last number of years. These increases primarily
reflect factors including higher average amount financed, longer term financing, shorter average time to repossession
and higher principal outstanding at repossession.
Our severity performance is generally consistent with our expectations. Our average severity of $8,900 in 2015 was
$1,000 higher than prior year. About $600 of this increase reflects the underlying physicals I just mentioned, while the
remainder reflects the inclusion of certain repossession expenses beginning in 2015 and noted on the slide.
The loss receivables ratio of 33 basis points was up six basis points from a year ago, primarily as a result of the increase
in severity. Despite the increase, the LTR remains near our historical lows. With higher severity and a growing balance
sheet, charge-offs were up $60 million from 2014.
On slide six, our 2015 lease return volume and return rates were lower than 2014. The return rate decrease reflecting
primarily a larger mix of 36-month placements, which typically have a lower return rate. In 2015, our auction values
were up from 2014 consistent with the industry. Leasing growth across the U.S. continued in 2015 was one of the
highest years ever.
Ford Credit share was up as well, but we remain below the industry average and within the parameters of our One Ford
lease strategy.
With that, our worldwide net investment operating leases was $25.1 billion at the end of 2015, up from $21.5 billion in
2014.
And now, I'll it turn over to Neil, who'll take us through the remainder of the material.
Neil M. Schloss
Good. Thanks, Marion, and good morning, everyone.
Turning to slide seven, we will walk through Ford Credit's full-year 2015 funding highlights. In 2015, Ford Credit
issued about $30 billion of public-term funding, which included about $17 billion of unsecured debt.
In the fourth quarter, we issued $6 billion, which included about $5 billion of unsecured. Other highlights including the
industry's first Reg AB II compliant securitization transaction in the U.S., as well as continuing our development in the
Chinese capital markets, with our first unsecured financial bond and two additional ABS transactions. In total, Ford
Credit issued RMB8 billion in the Chinese public capital markets.
Ford Credit ended the year with net liquidity of $23.5 billion, which included $3 billion allocated to Ford Credit from
Ford's revolving credit facility. Ford Credit's funding strategy remains focused on diversification, and we plan to
continue accessing a variety of markets, channels and investors. We continue to target a single-A investment grade
profile.
Slide eight shows Ford Credit's 2015 and projected 2016 global public funding plan, excluding our short-term funding
programs. As I mentioned earlier, in 2015, Ford Credit completed about $30 billion of public-term funding in the U.S.,
Europe, Canada, China, Australia and Mexico.
For 2016, Ford Credit projects full-year public-term funding in the range of $26 billion to $33 billion consisting of $14
billion to $18 billion of unsecured and $12 billion to $15 billion of public securitizations.

Slide nine shows the trends in funding for Ford Credit's managed receivables. At the end of 2015, managed receivables
were $127 billion and cash end of the year at $11 billion. Securitized funding was 39% of managed receivables. Ford
Credit is projecting 2016 year-end managed receivables of $134 billion to $139 billion.
We expect securitized funding as a percent of managed receivables to be between 37% and 40%. We expect this
percentage to decline over time. Quarterly and annual movements of this percentage reflects the calendarization of our
funding plan.
Turning to slide 10, I'd like to highlight Ford Credit's 2015 fourth quarter liquidity, which remains strong at $23.5
billion. Ford Credit's sources of liquidity include cash, committed asset-backed facilities, unsecured credit facilities and
the corporate revolver allocation.
At year-end, liquidity sources including cash totaled $49.7 billion, up $3.4 billion from the third quarter. Utilization of
liquidity was up $5 billion, reflecting accumulated cash to pay $1.7 billion January floorplan ABS maturity, as well as
higher receivables. Ford Credit is focused on maintaining strong liquidity to meet its business and funding
requirements.
Now, turning to the Automotive section. Slide 11 shows that Automotive debt was $12.8 billion at year-end, $1 billion
lower than year-end 2014. Ford ended the year with Auto cash of $23.6 billion and Automotive liquidity of $34.5
billion, both up from the third quarter and year-end 2014. Net cash end of the year at $10.8 billion, up $1.4 billion from
the third quarter and up $2.9 billion from year-end 2014.
Let's now turn to slide 12 for our annual update on pensions, where in 2016 we will conclude our strategy to fully fund
and de-risk our global funded pension plans. Worldwide, our year-end pension funded status improved by $1.6 billion
with an underfunded position of $8.2 billion, of which $5.7 billion or about 70% is associated with our unfunded plans.
Asset returns were down year-over-year, reflecting primarily fixed-income losses in the U.S. In 2015, we made $1.1
billion in cash contributions to our worldwide funded pension plans. In 2016, contributions are expected to be about
$1.5 billion. Worldwide pension expense, excluding special items, improved compared with 2014.
Now, let's close with a summary. It was another outstanding quarter that helped contribute to our breakthrough year.
Importantly, we delivered strong top-line growth with wholesale volumes and Automotive revenue both up 12% and
revenue up 18% at constant exchange.
Our fourth quarter pre-tax profit was $2.6 billion, was nearly double a year ago. Net income was $1.9 billion. Our
Automotive operating margin came in at 6.1%, up 2.7 percentage points from a year ago. We generated strong
Automotive operating-related cash flow at $2.1 billion. We were profitable in all business units, except South America,
including a record quarter in Asia-Pacific and a fourth quarter record for North America. In Europe, we delivered our
third consecutive profitable quarter.
Ford reported a record full-year company pre-tax profit of $10.8 billion, Automotive operating margin at 6.8% and
Automotive operating-related cash flow of $7.3 billion, the highest since at least 2001. At quarter-end, Automotive
cash was $23.6 billion and liquidity was $34.5 billion.
Ford Credit had another outstanding year with fourth quarter pre-tax profit of $556 million and full-year pre-tax profit
of $2.1 billion. Managed receivables ended the year at $127 billion, up $14 billion from a year ago.
As a result of its consistent purchase policy and world-class servicing, Ford Credit's portfolio continues to be robust
with credit losses at the low end of our historical experience. Ford Credit has completed its funding plans and closed
the year with strong liquidity of $23.5 billion.
Ford Credit is a strategic asset and integral to Ford's business. It supports sales, dealers, and builds customer
satisfaction and loyalty and delivers consistent profits from a strong business. The 2015 results highlight the success of
this strategy.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to start the Q&A session.

Stephen Dahle
Thanks, Neil. With that, we will start the question-and-answer session. Tony, may we please have the first caller?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Jacoby of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two questions. One, it kind of
came out on the earnings call, but maybe if I can just dig down a little deeper on, is on the free cash flow for 2016 is
expected to be down. And you alluded to the working capital line and I guess some non-repeat items on F-Series. But
can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on – I get the inventory side, but maybe on the other area? Like what are
some of the drains there that maybe are negatively impacting free cash flow in 2016? If you could help us with that,
that'd be helpful.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah, Brian. It's Stuart here. So, if you look at slide 23 at the deck from earlier this
morning, you can see that the cash flow. And if you look at the full-year column, the right-hand column, you can see
we had favorable effects in 2015 calendar year, both from working capital and from timing differences.
And as Bob noted on the call, the working capital was in part driven by, we had a negative impact on payables at year
end of 2015 as we took our Dearborn Truck Plant down. And then that didn't happen in – so, negative at year-end 2014
and that normalized at year-end 2015, so we had a positive impact on working capital in 2015 calendar year. We won't
get that again in 2016.
And then on the other end, timing differences, that's things such as accruals, marketing accruals, warranty accruals,
pension accruals, and the like. So, for example in there, we had higher marketing accruals in end of 2015, because we
had higher dealer stocks as we normalized our dealer stocks with the F-150 launch behind us.
So again, you don't repeat that. So, you've got two sort of timing factors there that we don't expect to see to the same
extent in 2016 calendar year. So, it's really about those working capital and timing changes. What we'll see again is
good strong profitability flowing through to cash flow, but just not quite to the same extent.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Maybe the only thing, Brian. Brian, the only thing I would add to that also is the CapEx
guidance that we've provided for 2016 at $7.7 billion is six times higher than it was in 2015.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah. Although you should also expect higher depreciation.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Right. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then on slide six, you have the lease return data.
And I'm just curious what – we've got a lot more vehicles coming off lease, obviously, for you and the industry as a
whole, right? So, just curious. What exactly are you guys doing that makes sure that folks get back into a Ford vehicle?
And how you're dealing with the strategy just on the dealer level, just to make sure that you go after those customers
that will be returning vehicles. Because I would assume the volume on 2016 would probably be higher than the
numbers that you're showing here on slide six.
<A - Marion Harris>: Yeah. That's right, Brian. This is Marion. We do expect higher lease return volume in 2016, just
because the industry over the last couple of years has been bigger and lease mix has been coming up. So, we would
expect to see, my guess is, we'll have a little over 200,000 units or so returning back to Ford.
We'll do, of course, everything we can to make sure they get into a new Ford. We actively do early-bird programs and
that's the beauty of lease, is it really gives us the opportunity to stay connected with the customer. So, we're actively
working on that. And I think we're really excited about the opportunity this year to turn over all that volume.

<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: And if I could ask, do you have like a success rate that maybe you could share with us, like in
the last two years, that you've been able to turn those customers back into a Ford vehicle?
<A - Marion Harris>: No specific success rate. We do know – we have talked about the loyalty factor of Ford Credit
and that's an important case. We know that customers have financed with Ford Credit are 15 percentage points or so
more loyal to Ford than those that do not.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. All right. And then, if I could throw one more in here, a quick one. But, it was again
talked on the earnings call that one of your competitors obviously is really taking a pretty dramatic move in throwing
all their resources on trucks and SUVs, and pretty much moving away from some car investments they made. And so
just curious, like, what is Ford's view on that?
Just, in particular, I'm not asking you to comment on what they're doing, but more importantly, just like your ability to
toggle up SUV and truck production – and obviously if the demand continues at the rate it is – and to react to what your
competitors are doing there. Any comments? That would be great.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah. This is Stuart. I mean, the first thing I wanted to stand back and say during this
environment, we're quite happy to be Ford Motor Company with a very strong lineup of trucks and SUVs in the U.S.
market. So, this is a good thing for us.
Now, to take advantage of that, we have been acting consistently over the last couple of years to put incremental
capacity in place. We've added shifts in Kansas City, we've taken the line right up in Kansas City and in Dearborn
Truck Plant. We've taken the line speed up in Louisville to build Escapes. As Mark said on the call, we're adding a
Super Duty we recently announced into our Ohio Assembly Plant.
So we've taken a number of actions. We have taken Explorer capacity up a number of times and we shifted that
capacity out of Taurus into Explorer in Chicago. And it's all of those actions that are delivering – that combined with
the great products, the benchmark level of margins we we're enjoying in North America.
At the same time, you've seen us take action on cars. So we took a shift off Michigan Assembly Plant last year. We
took some actions in Flat Rock; so we've dialed back correspondingly on the car side. But as we look to the medium
and the longer term, as well as just the short term of here and now, we know gas prices go down and we know gas
prices go up and we need to plan for both of those scenarios. So it's important that we have a full range of competitive
product, so that we can meet customers' needs in all of those scenarios.
And the other thing you see us doing is investing in fuel economy across the range, whether it be small cars, small
SUVs, or our iconic F-150 and the actions we've taken there. So it has to be a balance because we have to not only
generate profits, benchmark profits as we did in 2015 in that environment, we also have to do it when we find ourselves
in a different environment, which will happen at some point.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Couldn't agree more. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
<A - Stephen Dahle>: Thanks, Brian.
Operator
Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Eric Selle of
SunTrust. Please proceed.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Hey, guys. Getting back to Jacoby's questions on the cash flow, if I look at your Automotive
operating cash flow, it was $7.3 billion. And as you run your eye down below that, most of the stuff below that is
somewhat discretionary. I mean, you don't have to restructure; you don't have to pay dividends; you could have
refinanced the debt in the markets instead of paying cash. You guys are generating – it's a high-class problem. You
guys are generating $7 billion of cash a year. That's over half your debt. That's 15% of your market cap. How do you
guys balance the effort to go A-rated and continue to improve your balance sheet, with the fact that the equity market

really isn't rewarding the growth, doubling your earnings and the free cash flow you're generating? I mean, how do you
guys balance that internally?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah, Eric, this is Neil. And I think you're spot on from a standpoint of it's a high-class
problem, from the standpoint the amount of cash this business generates. I think also because of the balance that we
have and the way we work together with Ford Credit is really a strategic advantage for us relative to our peers that
allows us to be able to really maximize the benefit of having a finance company along with the ability to sell cars and
trucks.
And with that, it's really important to have a well-rated finance company. And so, as you know, from the actions we've
taken over the last four years or five years, getting our debt down and it's as low now as it's been in the long, long time.
Our pension funding status is at the point where we'll be completed with our strategy by the end of this year from a
standpoint of our funded plans.
We've got our leverage – multiple ways to which to calculate what that is. But we believe our balance sheet already is
at a single A-rating. And so, we need to continue to work it. We need to continue to work together to make sure we've
got the right balance of how we fund credit.
And then the use of Automotive cash, we've got flexibility from the standpoint of growth investments. You heard a lot
this morning on what we need to do from the standpoint of mobility. But also reward our shareholders in a way with
not only a base dividend, which is $2.4 billion a year right now, along with what we announced a couple weeks ago,
adding $1 billion supplemental.
And so, as you think through, we get to the point where we think we're doing a pretty good balance on both rewarding
our shareholders, but also investing in the balance sheet to make sure that we've got a very good credit rating, because
it's really important as we continue to grow Ford Credit to be single-A.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Neil, you're reading my mind, and it really dovetails into the next question. I mean your credit
stats are A-rated. And the last time I talked to the agencies, their triggers were, you're at breakeven, check; F-150
launch, clean, smooth, check; diversified profits, check. I mean what are their triggers? I mean, when you talk with
those guys, what else do you need to do? Or is it just – do you honestly need to go through a recession to prove that you
guys – this isn't your father's Oldsmobile and you guys have the flexibility in your cost? Is that what they need? Or is it
just continued discipline over time?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: I think we continue to execute the business and the strategy the way we think is important.
What they do and how they do it is, I think, it's best for you to ask them. We believe we're achieving everything we
need to achieve to get a better credit rating.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: We'll keep working from this side, as you know. And then, getting more in the detail, just my last
question is, we knew about the higher balances; obviously trucks are coming through, higher ticket prices; and we've
heard about the longer-term financings. The shorter time to repo, is that concerning? Or do you see that as still
normalizing? I mean is that a danger flag?
<A - Marion Harris>: Eric, it's Marion. It's a good question. It's one that really flowed through our portfolio as it
changed and we downsized as a company. And we've been growing, and it's returned back to normal. So, what we saw
is that the balance sheet shrunk and assets ran off. People were holding on – I shouldn't say, people were holding onto
their vehicles longer necessarily, it reflect the maturing of the portfolio. And so, as we have started to turn that around
and started growing the portfolio. What we're seeing is return to normal of the average time to repossession. And that's
– just so you know, that's about 24 months, 25 months for us. But, as we had downsized the balance sheet, it reached a
peak of over, say, 36 months. It just was longer...
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Yes, two years was more normal, as I remember.
<A - Marion Harris>: That's right. And so, we're just back at normal levels. But still, when you look at the effect in
2014, it was still at a higher level returning back to normal, and that's why it's a year-over-year variant this year.

Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Ms. Ashley Wieseltier, Prudential. Please
proceed.
<Q - Ashley Wieseltier>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Most of my questions have been
answered, but I just wanted to ask if more directly maybe you can discuss the balance sheet. You've talked about how
the balance sheet is currently in line with a higher rating; and previously you guys have talked about paying down
Automotive debt to $10 billion. So, just wanted to follow-up and see if that reduction is still in the plan for cash flow,
and if you're targeting that $10 billion level. Thank you.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah. Once we've gotten our debt and pension both to the construct of a single-A and using
sort of a leverage metrics that's more standard in the industry, we have walked from an absolute debt target. That said,
we have no plans at this point to raise debt in the U.S. We do borrow occasionally in international markets. So, that
debt number is going to move around. But, just following our big maturities as we go in time, the debt level will
continue to come down.
<Q - Ashley Wieseltier>: So, you are planning to pay down the maturities coming up and get to the $10 billion? Or are
you no longer targeting that $10 billion?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: We're no longer targeting the absolute number.
<Q - Ashley Wieseltier>: Great. Thank you.
