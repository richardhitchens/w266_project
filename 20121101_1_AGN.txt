Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Watson Third Quarter 2012 Earnings
Conference Call, where we will also discuss our acquisition of Actavis. Earlier this morning, Watson issued a press
release reporting its earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012. We also announced last evening that we
have successfully closed the acquisition of Actavis. These press releases will be available on our website, at
www.watson.com. Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call which will also be available on our
website after its conclusion.
With us on today's call are Paul Bisaro, our President and CEO, who will provide an overview of Watson's third quarter
results. Todd Joyce, our Global Chief Financial Officer, will then provide additional details on the performance of our

With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. First, I would like to say to all those
impacted by Hurricane Sandy, including our employees, families and friends, we hope that everyone was able to
weather the storm safely. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone and we hope that we will all be able to return to
normal very quickly.
Today is a historic day for Watson. We have closed the acquisition of Actavis and are truly a larger, more powerful
global company. Today also represents the last time we were report Watson's earnings as a stand-alone company. And
I'm very pleased to announce that our exceptional third quarter 2012 performance demonstrates that we begin as a new
company on a solid and growing financial foundation.
This morning, we'll focus on two things during the call. First, Todd and I will review the highlights of the third quarter,
then we'll provide an update on the completion of the acquisition and provide you with some guidance regarding what
we expect for the new company on a combined basis for the remainder of this year and our preliminary view of our
expectations for 2013. So, as we get started, I want to welcome all of our new colleagues from Actavis to our team. Our
company is uniquely positioned with a strong foundation for continued success, and working together, I'm very
confident of a bright and profitable future.
Let's look at Watson's stand-alone third quarter results, which included another quarter of double-digit revenue,
adjusted EBITDA and earnings growth. Net revenues increased 19% to $1.3 billion, non-GAAP earnings were up 24%
to $1.35 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $305 million in the quarter. Cash flow from operations
were approximately $146 million for the quarter.
We had a number of highlights in each business segment. In our Global Generics business, we've received a final FDA
approval for our generic version of Lidoderm. With a final approval in place, our agreement with Endo allows for a
date certain launch of our generic version of Lidoderm in September of 2013.
We launched a number of new products, including generic VANCOCIN, generic ARTHROTEC, Next Choice One
Dose, our generic version of Plan B One-Step, and an authorized generic version of Xopenex inhalation solution. We

received final FDA approval for generic Pulmicort RESPULES. Since the end of the third quarter, we received FDA
approval for our generic versions of Sanctura XR and Actos, and began shipping both products.
Our international business generated over $198 million in revenue. The increase resulted from the acquisition of Ascent
as well as organic growth driven by new product launches in key markets. In our Global Brands business, we
experienced continued strength in sales of key promoted products, including RAPAFLO, Generess Fe and CRINONE.
In July, we licensed in a biosimilar to Herceptin from Synthon and contributed to our Amgen collaboration. This
transaction demonstrates the flexibility of this partnership to capitalize on opportunities to develop quality assets for
introduction at market formation. On September 27, we priced $3.9 billion in aggregate of senior unsecured notes at
very favorable interest rates, completing the necessary financing to fund the acquisition of Actavis.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Todd to review our third quarter financial results. Todd?
R.Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I will now review our results on a consolidated and divisional basis.
Watson's net revenues for the third quarter were $1.285 billion, an increase of the 19% over the prior-year period. In
our Global Generics division, net revenues were $921 million up 15% year-over-year, which includes the generic
version of Lovenox launched in January, the generic version of VANCOCIN launched in April and an authorized
generic version of Xopenex launched in August.
Higher international net revenue from the addition of Ascent also contributed to the year-over-year revenue growth.
This growth was partially offset by lower sales of generic oral contraceptives. Sales of the extended release products
were $339 million, down 1% on stronger sales of generic Concerta offset by lower sales of generic Toprol XL and
Micro-K as result of competition. Sales of oral contraceptive products were $103 million, down 10% compared to the
prior year, primarily due to competition on our base oral contraceptive franchise.
Ex-U.S. net revenues were $198 million, up 37% from the third quarter of 2011. International net revenue increased as
a result of the acquisition of Ascent Pharmaceuticals in January of 2012 and higher sales in key markets, including the
UK, Canada and France.
Global Generics' adjusted gross margin was 47.2%, up 70 basis points year-over-year due to higher margins on sales of
our authorized generic version of Concerta. Under our agreement with J&J, our share of profit from this product
increased year-over-year. Our share of profit will increase further if a competitor enters the market. This was offset in
part by an increase in certain ex-U.S. sales at lower margins.
Moving to our Global Brands Division, net revenues were $121.3 million, up 10% on higher sales of promoted
products, including Generess Fe, CRINONE, and RAPAFLO. Global brands adjusted gross margin was 75%, down 2.5
percentage points as a result of higher manufacturing costs and a more favorable product mix in the prior-year period.
Finally, net revenues from our Anda Distribution Division were $243 million, up 44% on third-party product launches.
Anda's gross margin for the quarter was 15.1%, down 1.9 percentage points year-over-year as a result of lower margins
on certain sales to chain customers.
Turning now to operating expenses, consolidated GAAP research and development for the third quarter increased 53%
to $113 million from $73 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher upfront and third-party development
milestone costs for biosimilar development, including the in-licensing agreement with Synthon for a biosimilar to
Herceptin, which was contributed to our biosimilars collaboration with Amgen.
Our biosimilar investment for the quarter was $44 million, which included $34 million in licensing and milestone
payments. SG&A on a GAAP basis was $225 million, up 19% year-over-year. The current-year period includes $13.9
million in acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Actavis. The current-year period also includes
SG&A costs associated with the Ascent business acquired in January.

Amortization expense for the third quarter was $95 million, which includes $15 million of amortization related to our
generic Xopenex product rights.
Our income tax rate on a GAAP basis was 31.3%, down 11.6 percentage points from 42.9% in the prior-year period as
a result of certain non-taxable foreign exchange gains recognized in the current-year period. On a non-GAAP basis our
income tax rate was 33.8% in the third quarter, down 1.2 percentage points from 35% in the prior-year period. The
non-GAAP rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of certain federal tax liabilities for tax years under audit. The
non-GAAP rate was also favorably impacted by the sale of [ph] Mocha 8 (10:55) as tax benefits associated with prior
equity losses could be recorded in the current-year period.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization and impairment charges and other charges detailed in Table 4 of
our press release, earnings for the third quarter are $1.35 per share, up 24% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, earnings
increased 11% to $0.60 per share for the third quarter, which includes foreign exchange gains of $53 million on
derivatives used to hedge the company's euro denominated Actavis acquisition price, an impairment charge of $32
million net of tax related to a manufacturing facility located in Greece, and amortization of our bridge loan financing
fees of $7.1 million net of tax related to the acquisition of Actavis.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $304 million, an increase of 18%. Cash flow from operations for the
third quarter was $146 million and cash and marketable securities were $234 million at quarter end.
Our existing capital structure has allowed us to take advantage of a very favorable interest rate environment and
complete financing for the acquisition of Actavis during the quarter. As Paul mentioned, we've priced $3.9 billion in
aggregate of senior unsecured notes at an average effective rate of 3.36% and an average tenor of 14 years. This
includes $1.2 billion of five-year notes, $1.7 billion of 10-year notes and $1 billion of 30-year notes. At close, this
brings our total borrowings to $6.7 billion. By year-end, we expect our leverage ratio to be approximately 3.6 times,
based upon pro forma adjusted EBITDA for 2012.
The strong anticipated future cash flows generated from the combined business will enable us to de-lever quickly and
we continue to expect to achieve a leverage ratio of approximately three times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA by the end of
2013.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2012 forecast and our initial outlook for 2013 and
concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. Last evening, we successfully closed the acquisition of Actavis. This combination is truly transformative
for our company, creating the third-largest global generics company. We also announced our intention to adopt a new
global name, Actavis, for the combined entity. We will begin using Actavis as our global name in 2013.
When Watson began its global expansion in 2009, it became clear that we could not establish a single, unified global
market presence under the Watson name. When we announced the proposed acquisition of Actavis in April, we
immediately instituted an extensive and accelerated review of our global brand position and naming equity.
We recognized there were many benefits presenting a single name to all stakeholders, customers, consumers, payers,
institutions and shareholders and potential shareholders. As this process progressed, it became clear that one of the
many assets within this acquisition was the Actavis name, which is not only a dynamic and exciting name, but also is
trademarked and protected around the world. It invokes powerful words – action, vision and strength, time-honored
attributes of both Watson and Actavis.
Adopting this name on a global basis for all our generics brands and biosimilars business was a logical and
cost-effective solution. We'll begin to use our new name in 2013 and trade under a new symbol. In the interim, the
combined company will continue to be referred to as Watson and will trade under the symbol WPI.

The acquisition combines two successful, profitable and growing companies into a leading global generics player
operating in more than 60 countries. The company has a core leadership position in modified release products, solid
oral doses, transdermals, semisolids, liquids and injectables and features an industry-leading global product portfolio of
over 750 molecules offered in more than 1,700 different combinations and dosage forms.
The U.S. pipeline is among the strongest in the industry, with 180 unique ANDA's pending at the FDA, including 47
first-to-files, of which over 30 are exclusive. Outside of the U.S., the pipeline includes more than 2,000 marketing
authorizations pending approval. Globally, there are an additional 600 new products currently in developing covering
multiple dosage forms.
We have worked very hard to plan the integration of Actavis. We have already announced the new global management
structure of the combined company, and I can state with confidence that today, on day one, we began to execute a
seamless integration with a focus on rapidly achieving our synergy targets of $300 million within the first three years.
Now I would like to discuss our updated forecast for 2012. First, on a stand-alone basis, which excludes an additional
5.5 million shares and interest expense associated with the acquisition of Actavis, Watson's global generics revenue
would have been at the high end of the forecasted range we provided in July of 2012. Global Brands revenue would
have been slightly below its forecasted range, and Anda and Anda Distribution is expected to be at or above the top end
of its forecasted range. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the full year would have been expected to be slightly
above the mid-point of the July forecasted range of $5.65 to $5.85 per share.
Moving now to a combined basis, our updated forecast for 2012 and preliminary outlook for 2013 is as follows. First,
the assumptions. The results include Actavis as of today's close. There are no major product launches contemplated for
the remainder of 2012. We have removed all impact from the divested products for the last two months of 2012 and
going forward. Our forecast includes certain assumptions for increased competition on our oral contraceptives and
extended-release products, including a competitive entrant on generic Concerta in the first quarter of 2013.
We've included no major patent challenges in our forecast for 2013, with the exception of generic Pulmicort, which has
FDA approval, and the generic Mucinex products, which are awaiting FDA approval. We do not assume any additional
competitors on generic Adderall XR for 2013. So for the full year of 2012, we estimate our total net revenue to be $5.9
billion, and we expect the adjusted EBITDA of $1.360 billion to approximately $1.4 billion. We expect non-GAAP
earnings per diluted share in the range of $5.85 and $5.95 per share.
Moving on to our initial outlook for 2013, we expect our non-GAAP earnings to grow 30% to 40% over the high end of
our estimated combined range for 2012. There are no major changes to our assumptions of approximately $300 million
in annual cost synergies to be achieved over three years. This forecast includes the achievement of synergies beginning
in the first quarter of 2013, with a gradual increase each quarter thereafter.
Given the strong performance of the Actavis business for year-to-date 2012 and our expectations for the remainder of
the year, we expect Actavis to achieve the full value of the earn-out resulting in the issuance of 5.5 million shares of
Watson's common stock as incremental consideration for the acquisition. Therefore, we expect a fully diluted share
count of approximately 137.7 (sic) [134.7] (19:19) million fully diluted shares outstanding for 2013 – I'm sorry, 134.7
million. I'm sorry, I misspoke that. For accounting purposes, the additional shares will appear on the income statement
beginning immediately. This is contemplated in the updated forecast for 2012.
Finally, we plan to hold an Investor Day for 2013 in New York in January, where we intent to provide a more
comprehensive review of the combined business and further detail our expectations for 2013.
In closing, our strong results for the third quarter of 2012 demonstrates that we enter this powerful combination with
solid, profitable and a growing foundation, combined with significantly enhanced and – combined, we significantly
enhance the growth potential of our organization and ability to continue to drive long-term shareholder value. As I
mentioned previously, we start today the execution of a seamless integration with an unwavering focus on rapidly
capturing the tremendous value of this transformative combination.

I would like to thank all of our employees of both Actavis and Watson around the world for their hard work in helping
to achieve a successful close of this acquisition and very strong results for year-to-date 2012. I hope that all the
shareholders share our excitement in the potential for our company as we continue our strong growth in 2013 and
beyond.
With that we can now take questions. Lisa?
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Andrea, we'll go ahead and take our questions.
Q&A
Operator
Yes, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Maybe first, as you look at that Actavis ANDA portfolio, what are some of the highlights you'd
point us to there? Also we're thinking about that, can you talk about Actavis' approach towards settlement? I know this
is something obviously Watson has been very effective with. Do you see any settlement opportunities as you look at
your new pipeline here?
And my second question was on the 2013 preliminary guidance. It looks like it's fairly in line with some of the original
comments you made back in April, but we've had quite a bit of good news for the company, we've had some lower
financing costs, we've had Lidoderm, we've had Adderall XR. In that context, has there been any kind of negative
offsets we should be thinking about here? Was this all just incorporated the original range? Or should we just be
thinking about these targets as being conservative? Thanks very much.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, Chris, it's Siggi. Maybe I'll start on the pipeline and Paul takes the settlement on
the guidance. I think what Actavis has to offer in the U.S. is they have three development centers in the U.S., and the
focus from them has been, as for us, on the slow-release, modified-release product, solid oral, but also they have an
expensive semi-solid development in Owings Mills in Maryland. They have a first-to-file of creams and ointments,
which is in addition to our pipeline.
On top of that, Actavis has a pipeline of injectable products, which they've developed both in Romania and in Italy,
which will be addition to our pipeline. So the combined 180 pending ANDAs has, in fact, from all dosage, from
injectables, semi-solid, liquids, tablets and respiratory products. So we cover now all the doses forms we really want to
be in.
Paul?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, I'll just touch on – the other part of that question had to do with settlement. We are
always willing and we'll continue to be willing to talk to parties to find ways to resolve litigation, particularly things
that – well, any kind of litigation, specifically patent litigation, where is always problematic is to whether or not you're
going to win or not. So we remain open to those opportunities, Chris, and we'll keep working on that.
Regarding our 2013 guidance, I appreciate the fact that you recognize we were spot on with what we gave at the
beginning. And, yeah, there is some upside that we've experienced over the last few months, but there has also been
negatives, as you would expect in any business. There ups and downs. Some other things that we saw that they didn't
go the way we had hoped was the esomeprazole in Europe did not go as well as we had hoped it would go. We also had
a bit of the Actos issue, as I'm sure you're aware of that that didn't go the way we liked, although we ultimately
received final approval, but not being there at market formation certainly affected our income for 2012 and for 2013.

You know, there's a bit of a third party business not growing as rapidly as we had originally hoped, and that's due to
some of the austerity measures in Europe. Siggi can talk more about that later on. And finally, as we begin this process,
as we look at the first day of having a combined company, one of the things we have to do is look towards the future
and, you know, I've always said that investing in R&D is our primary – one of our primary objectives. We need to look
very hard at how we allocate some of the value that we're getting by the positives that are going on, and redirecting
some of those positives, not just back to the bottom line for the shareholders, but also investing for the future.
And that includes investing in more clinical end-point studies for our generics business, getting more interesting
product portfolios for our international business, as well as our brands and biosimilar business. By accelerating some of
the things we've been doing with the Amgen – with Amgen and with the Herceptin arrangement, we will be spending
more in the short-term than we had originally forecasted. But that's a good thing, that's not a bad thing. So, I am very
pleased to be able to redirect some of these funds to build for the future because I think for our shareholders that's the
important thing to do.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great. And just a quick follow-up to that. If you continue – if we do see more – I mean, should
we continue to that think about that the cost trend, that there is maybe even more opportunity as we get into 2013, that
that might be a year that we should think about the more reinvestment as compared to potential kind of earnings upside
as the year progresses?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, Chris, I don't know if I'd say that, because, first of all, it's still very early. There's still
plenty of upside opportunities, as I articulated in our forecast. We have no patent challenge upside for any of the
existing cases, including INTUNIV and some of the other things that are coming – that could come in 2013. Also, if we
capture, if we're able to accelerate the capture of synergies, both cost synergies and revenue synergies, that's a potential
upside.
So, there's always potential upsides in the businesses, but we have to always recognize that in our business there's some
potential downsides and we've got to be prepared for those. So, for us, it seemed like a very prudent thing to do to say
that we're going to be 30% growth over the combined results for 2012. I think our shareholders, frankly, should be
pleased with that number. That's a very significant number. It's very hard to imagine any other company posting that
kind of growth. And we're proud of it and we'll continue to focus on double-digit growth. As we've said over the last
five years, we've been very focused on it and we'll remain focused on it.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Thanks very much.

Operator

<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Ashley, why don't we go on to the next question?
Operator
Yes, ma'am. Your next question comes from the line of Gary Nachman with Financial Group.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. First, Siggi, what's the overall environment in
Europe from government austerity measures? Is increased generic utilization offsetting pricing pressures or is it the
reverse? And then I'll ask another one to Paul.

<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, Gary. We see it a little bit different between different markets. We see the
markets, like in France, there's an increased utilization for sure. We see I think all the generic companies are showing a
better top line. I'm not sure if that is delivering in the same amount to the bottom line because there's a very severe
competition between all the companies in France. But, clearly, we are seeing an upside there.
Other countries are trying to do the same. We see it in Greece. I've mentioned before in our conference calls, Greece
has around 20% generic penetration. And for to get any benefit from price decrease on generics, they need increase the
utilization much, much more before they start to get the benefit from the price decrease. I think the Greek government
is recognizing that. They are finding way to increase generic utilizations and hopefully over the next few months we
will see that picking up.
We feel that the UK market now in the combined company – the combined company will be number two in UK.
Clearly, there's a significant saving going on for the prescription business in the UK. It's a tough market to operate in.
But, overall, I think size matters in UK, and we have a very significant portfolio to offer. It has benefited us in the
bottom line.
And last, but not least, maybe if I talk about the Nordics, we will be the largest generic company in the Nordics,
number one in Sweden, Norway and Iceland, number three in Denmark and number five in Finland. Yes, there are
austerity measures in place, but due to our size and offering both prescription drugs, OTC drugs and hospital drugs, we
feel that we are doing well in these markets on the size of the portfolio and the company is helping us.
The markets which I am still negative on is probably the enter markets in Germany and Holland, as an example.
Utilization there is very high. We are talking about between 70% and 80% utilization of generics in these markets. But,
overall, the prices are very, very low. It's a volume game in these markets today and probably will be going forward.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Okay, that's very helpful. And then, Paul, just a few more on the 2013 guidance. What have
you assumed for the estimated impact from Lidoderm? Will that be an exclusive situation when you launch in
September? Your next year tax rate assumptions, if you could give us that? And also just plans with consolidation of
manufacturing facilities and how that may be able to improve gross margin? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. I think I'll start with Lidoderm and then I'll turn over the tax to Todd and then Bob will
take the manufacturing. But on the Lidoderm, we have no reason to expect that we will not have exclusivity when we
launch in September, and we would expect that exclusivity to continue through into 2014. So, our expectation has not
changed. We have not had any indication otherwise, and we firmly believe that that's our position. So, Todd?
<A - R.Todd Joyce>: Yeah, concerning the tax rate, our initial guidance was approximately 28%. Based upon our
current review, we still feel comfortable with that estimate. We will start to realize that beginning in the fourth quarter
and we expect to be able to achieve that tax rate throughout 2013.
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Yeah, and on the manufacturing side, I think as Paul's mentioned in prior meetings, that we
really have not included a large manufacturing synergy component in our $300 million target. We will have quite an
extensive manufacturing network, with over 30 plants around the world. Clearly, there's going to be an opportunity to
streamline manufacturing and find more efficient ways to move product through our supply chain. And, as we do that,
we'll communicate different decisions. But there's no question about it, there will be opportunities in the longer term,
because it takes a long time to move products around the network, it takes a long time to shut down manufacturing
facilities. And so you'll see us continuing in our global supply chain initiative going forward, and, as we make those
decisions, communicate what the impact would be.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Okay, thanks. And congrats on closing the deal.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Thank you.

Marc, your line is open.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Can we go to the next question?

Your next question comes from the line of Shibani Malhotra with RBC Capital.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: On Lidoderm, Paul, we understand that you'd probably keep first-to-file exclusivity. But just
looking at the science behind the FDA's approval of your batch, what do you think are the chances of Mylan getting
their Lidoderm approved as well, given that it's a different formulation?
And then second, on Pulmicort, can you just expand on what your assumptions are in terms of entering the market? Is it
just Watson that you're assuming, or are you assuming Sandoz and Apotex? And how risk adjusted is this? And
congrats on a great quarter and great guidance as well.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, Shibani, thank you. We appreciate that. On the Lidoderm question, I think we'll sort of
defer that question to the fight between Endo and Mylan about whether or not these two products are equivalent. I think
our position is our product is approvable, we have an approval, we will launch the product in September and we have
exclusivity. We are guiding towards that and we are forecasting for that result.
So, we have the $96 million of brand product that we'll be distributing the first half of 2013, we will launch our generic
version in September and we'll carry that six-month period through 2014. That's the way we're forecasting it for both
2013 and 2014. And we would then expect – we are then forecasting competition at the end of the 180-day period.
Siggi?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, so on Pulmicort, as you know, we have the FDA approval. The court starts on
November 7, and we assume approval sometime early in 2013, but with a competition. So we don't assume to be alone
in the market.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay, great.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Faerm with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: I have two. The first one is regarding the 2013 guidance. Could you give some sense of the
major swing factors between the low end of the range and high end of the range? And secondly, regarding the synergies
of this $300 million guidance. Could you give some sense of the relative weighting between the cost of goods, R&D
and SG&A of that $300 million, and the extent to which any of those could have potential upside? Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think the swing factors would really be synergy capture and our ability to launch certain
products around the world on time. And then the other factor I think would be what is the competitive environment
going to look like in the U.S. for some of our existing products. We have forecasted I think appropriately, but we've
forecasted certain competition on oral contraceptives and certain competition on extended-release products. If that
competition doesn't materialize or the pricing impact is lower than we expect, that would be one of the swing factors.

I would also say that some of the products, like Pulmicort, that we just talked about, is also a potential swing factor. If
there is less competition than we expect at the time we launch the product, we could, of course, see a bigger impact
from Pulmicort than – and then on the other hand, if we lose the litigation, we would have potentially a negative impact
on our overall forecast. So, we've got, as with everything, we've got things moving in both directions.
Again, I would remind you, we did not include any of the other patent challenges in here. So, if we think about our
forecast, we've been very comfortable with it, we understand that it's early, it's preliminary, it's a bit wide. We would
expect that in January we'll have more visibility and we'll try to give you a lot more clarity at that time.
Todd, you want to take on the...?
<A - R.Todd Joyce>: As part of that January meeting, we'll also provide some additional details around all the
operating expenses, R&D expectations for 2013, SG&A, as well as what our expectations are for synergy capture
during the year as well as the timing, we'll be a little more specific on the timing.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: And the second question on the synergies, could you provide any color on the weighting
between the expense lines and potential for any upside on any of those?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, we don't go through it – Siggi here. We don't go through the details. But the
synergies that we capture at first, there's a little bit of the R&D overlapping synergies that we will capture quite soon
based on an overlapping project that both companies are working on, and we only have to go forward with one of the
projects. There is also, because we're overlapping in seven countries, there's a quick SG&A synergies in those
countries, which we'll start to realize sometime in the first quarter, but more throughout the year.
The cost synergies are a little bit more difficult to realize because we have agreements in place on our API purchasing.
We're obviously working very hard on lowering our cost of goods, but that will be later in the year for sure, because we
both have inventory of [ph] API and its related to (37:55) materialize in our numbers. So without going into the details
between the three, I think that's how we can explain it.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Hey, good morning. How are you?
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Good. How are you?
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Congratulations on closing the deal. Just curious if you could provide an update on your
current thoughts in terms of development approaches. Obviously, you disclosed the resolution of the appeal to the
FDA.
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: Hi, this is Fred Wilkinson. Yeah, obviously, we did announce that the appeal was
denied. As kind of a reminder, the appeal was based on focusing on the 1998 guidance, which allows for approval on a
single well-controlled study as well as back-up data from the literature.
We did offer up additional analysis to answer some of the questions to the FDA and the Ad Board had, as we went
through the process over the last year. We're also committed to a very large Phase IV program that would have actually
provided one of the larger databases on pre-term birth. But, as you saw, this appeal was denied. There are still a few
avenues, but I think it's unlikely that we'll pursue those avenues at this particular time.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay, great. And then perhaps this is Paul or Siggi. I was just curious if you had any sort of
initial impressions or thoughts in terms of some of the controversy regarding competitors' products for Wellbutrin and

other generic versions of Wellbutrin. And I'm less curious about that specific product, but what you think that might
mean for extended-release products and your positioning in that segment of the market, where it has always been a
particular strength of Watson and it also seems to be a strength of Actavis, and how your capabilities in that field might
increase?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, Douglas, it's Siggi. Maybe I'll take that. I think the Wellbutrin example is
something that came up with the Impax product. We have Wellbutrin XL both in the Actavis portfolio and in the
Watson portfolio. We are running the new bio study, as requested, as we speak and we feel very comfortable on our
formulation of Wellbutrin for sure. With regards to how this impacts the whole portfolio, I think Wellbutrin was a
special case because we run a very significant bio study programs on all our slow-release formulations on different
strengths, both single dose and multiple dose, [indiscernible] (40:35), so there is a significant clinical program behind
it.
So, I don't think this will affect the whole of the modified-release, slow-release formulation development going
forward. But it's critical to have in mind that this is something that we need to monitor, but that's what the development
process is about is to show that there is a bioequivalence between the brand on the generic that we're introducing to the
market.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Do you think that this could potentially erect some additional barriers to entry for additional
competitors interested in those types of products?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think, what I would say, Doug, is that it's possible. But I think those barriers already
existed. I believe the FDA had been taking a much more aggressive view on extended-release products. We saw that
with our metoprolol XL product, where they – we delivered three validation batches, on a number of extended-release
products, we actually delivered even production batch data prior to getting final approval. Assuming that the FDA is
applying those standards across the board, I think that that's appropriate. And, again, as long as everybody lives to the
same standard, Watson, now Actavis, is more than happy to meet them.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Leerink Swann.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Jason, are you there?
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Yeah, can you hear me, Lisa?
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Yeah.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Sorry. Paul, could you just confirm that for 2013 guidance that some of that upside was, in
fact, due to reinvestment in the business? Second question, any additional learnings since the April announcement on
the deal that maybe there is a better long-term tax rate? And then, Paul, just lastly, on the FTC push for review of the
pay-for-delay at the Supreme Court level, can you just talk maybe a little bit about how that might impact settlement
structures going forward if the FTC were to get a positive outcome there? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. Yes, on 2013, one of the things I did discuss was that we would expect to invest more in
R&D, both in biologics and generics as well as brands, in 2013 than I think most – to use a point of reference that I
think most analysts have projected. And which of course, makes sense, as we look at the biosimilars opportunities, we
were able to accelerate Herceptin product. That, of course, means we're going to spend more in the first year. The good
news is we have the ability to do that reallocation and still provide, I think, a terrific return to our shareholders with
upside, and we've kind of walked through that. I think the long-term – I forget what that was exactly?

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'll let you take that one, Siggi, and then I'll come back for pay-for-delay.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, I think since we signed on April 25, we have learned much more about the
business [indiscernible] (43:43) is one thing, but we've been working hand-in-hand with the Actavis management and
the employees in preparing for the integration. So, I think the positive thing is we feel that they have even a stronger
pipeline than we expected, during due diligence they have had extremely strong R&D, both internationally but also in
the U.S., which we've seen. We've also been impressed with management team and the employees.
As you probably saw in our announcement yesterday, a significant portion of the Actavis management team will be
management team of the new combined company. We are really, really pleased about that, how we've been able to
build our combined management team of the best people in the industry. Those are probably the big two learnings.
<A - R.Todd Joyce>: Sure, and in terms of tax rate, there most of our focus has been on the acquisition structure. So a
lot of time went into all the planning that had to take place in order to achieve that 28% of the outset. As we move
forward, we'll continue to focus on ways in which we can bring down that effective tax rate on a longer-term basis.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Right. And I think your last question was about the taking the so-called pay-for-delay to the
Supreme Court. I would like to call the Third Circuit decision an outlier, not a split in the Circuits. Remember, most of
the Circuits that have ruled on this have found what you would expect they would find, that because there is a patent in
place, people are allowed to settle patent cases.
Continually I have said I think the FTC has been wrong-headed about this. They just refuse to acknowledge that it isn't
about the case, it's about the patent. If they don't like the patent system, they should work on changing the patent
system, not the cases. And changing the law doesn't make sense in this case. But with that said, should they be
successful, then we would have to reevaluate the way we approach these cases. I personally of the belief that I think it's
a long-shot that the Supreme Court would overturn, I don't know, 300 years of jurisprudence that says that people can
settle cases. But, you know what, I could be wrong.

Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Hi, David. Are you there?
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me?
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Yes.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay, sorry about that. All right. So, first question is on Adderall XR. I know you're
guiding to no additional competition in 2013. I'm actually interested what in your thoughts are on 2014 given that the
AGs are going to expire for both Teva and Impax. Do you think this it's going to be a two-way market between
essentially you and Shire in 2014?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, David. It's Siggi. I think it's difficult to say. We have said that there is a potential
that in 2014, if there is no further approvals of Adderall generic, Adderall XRs in the market, that when the AGs expire
that this would end up being a two-player market, maybe with another company getting an AG.
There's also we know there's at least two companies that are working very hard to get approvals. They are some way
back, to our belief. But you're absolutely right, there could be a scenario in 2014 where we essentially would be in a
less competition. We so far have not modeled it like that. We need to understand a little bit more about the competition,
how all this is doing. And – but we will monitor that throughout 2013, how 2014 will look.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay. And then switching gears to Concerta. I know you're expecting a competitor in the
first quarter 2013, but considering that [indiscernible] (47:27) doesn't have an approval, they could have launched

several months ago, and Impax cannot launch until July of 2013 per their settlement. Is it possible that you're just
plainly being conservative here on Concerta and that we could see some period in 2013 where you're still the only
generic?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, that's always a possibility. I think it's prudent for us to model it the way we did, which is
a January launch – or I'm sorry, mid-quarter launch of first quarter. I think that's the right place to be. Should they come
– should UCB come earlier, we still have that anomaly where we do believe it will take time for any competitor, no
matter who it is, to gain market share simply because of the time that it takes to ramp up production, ramp up a
Schedule II product and get product into the marketplace.
And then we also have that switchover of the royalty stream. So I think we've I think appropriately modeled 2013.
Should that change, should there be a further delay, then we'll communicate what that means at the time. But right now
I think this is the right way to go.

Your next question comes from the line of David Buck with Buckingham Research.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, David.
Operator
David, your line is open.
<Q - David George Buck>: Can you hear me?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yep.
<Q - David George Buck>: Okay, great. I just wanted to touch base on couple of quick questions. First on the
synergies, can you talk a little bit about where the synergies are likely to come from? Is it going to be more from R&D?
It looked like Actavis outspent Watson, at least in 2012's first half. Was there going to be more from the consolidation
of plants? And can you give us just an update on the current thoughts, if you did not, on INTUNIV entry and Lidoderm
number of competitors in 2013? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: So, let me, David, take the R&D and on the synergies. I think as I mentioned, the first
synergies that will come will be in the overlapping projects. As you know, especially on the U.S. side, we're all going
after the same molecules. So there is some overlap on their low-hanging fruits where we can capture synergies of not
spending on clinical studies for both products or projects, API, et cetera. So, clearly, there is an early synergy there.
But also in the SG&A in the overlapping sales and marketing structure, especially in the U.S., where you have a key
account management with a small sales and marketing team, Actavis have the full team, we have the full team, so there
is clearly a synergy there. Same applies to UK, France, a little bit in the Nordics, Germany, Poland, and Australia. So
there's an opportunity there.
With regards to the significant spend on R&D in Actavis and Watson, as Paul mentioned in his answer to the first
question, we want to reinvest our part of the synergies into new products, especially focusing maybe on respiratory
products, on creams and ointments, where we need to do a clinical end-point studies, the average cost of these
development projects is about five times more than the average of a tablet development.
So to talk about significant synergy in R&D, yes, there is clearly an opportunity, which we will capture early, but we
also want to go in to their harder to develop products and reinvest some of the synergies into the future growth of the
company.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, I would also add, there's probably one other area, that's procurement. And, Bob, do you
want to take that?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Yeah. So, we're going to be the largest procurer of API or purchasers of API in the entire
generic industry. So we think that there's clear opportunities there to reduce our cost, as Siggi mentioned. We have to
bleed off inventory levels, we have to change suppliers in certain cases. And so that's another area of synergy that we
expect to capitalize on over the next several years.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And I think, David, you asked about INTUNIV and then Lidoderm. On the INTUNIV, we did
not include INTUNIV in our 2013 forecast. We have to evaluate that, the case is still pending, and we'll have to wait
and see what happens there.
On Lidoderm, we do not have – we have not forecasted any competition for 2013, as I mentioned earlier. 2014 we
would expect to see one competitor at the end of the 180 days. And then we know of I think a couple of additional
filers, but they would be very early on in the process, and whether they would be able to join us in 2014 is probably still
too early to tell. But I will probably – it would be a bit of longshot to see them in 2014.
<Q - David George Buck>: Great. And just one – if I could sneak in one more. Paul, did you talk about the outlook for
growth at all in 2014? Obviously, the 30% to 40% adjusted EPS growth for 2013 was given, but the comment I think in
the past was hoping to grow double-digits going forward after 2013. Was that talked about or, if not, what's the
outlook?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: We haven't given formal guidance. But I would say that – and I will continue to say that it is
the company's stated objective that we continue to grow at a double-digit rate. We've grown at a double-digit rate the
last five years and we would look to do that in 2013, 2014. Obviously, in 2013 we've given you double-digit growth,
but...
<Q - David George Buck>: Right.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: ...also, we would look to do that in 2014. Hopefully in January we can give you a little bit of
more color around 2014 as well as 2013.

2013 guidance, how many generic Concertas and additional generic Concertas are you assuming in your guidance for
2013?

guidance. And we've included competition as well. So, there are upsides and downsides associated with that, Jami. If
we're successful in launching the product, and we're one of the only ones that are able to do that, then...

<Q - Jami Rubin>: Yeah.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: ...it could be upside to the number. Should we be unsuccessful, of course, we would not be able
to include the gross profit and there would be a bit of challenge then to the number. But I think the 30% to 40% growth
was cognizant of that risk.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: And then just one last question, Paul, if I may. The branded business has been sort of the weak link
of the story over the past I guess six to eight quarters or so. And I'm just wondering if you could comment on that?
Obviously, the focus has been on Actavis and the synergies of the generic business, which has outperformed
expectations. But can you just talk to us about your views on the brand business and your commitment to further
growth in that business? And that would seem to me that in order to really accelerate the pace of that growth, that you
would need to do a branded acquisition.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, Jami, first of all, I think I wouldn't describe the brand business as a weak link. I think
they have done an extraordinary job with the brands that we have. We have worked very diligently to try to find as
many opportunities as possible. I will say it's been a challenging road. There's a lot of money chasing very limited
assets on the brand side of the business and I think our team has done a great job at trying to find those that are out
there.
I have to say, I think we would all – it would be terrible, I'm sure you can imagine the entire management team has
been disappointed and a bit frustrated with the FDA on the [ph] Protiv (56:03) decisions. But that's the way it goes in
the brand business from time to time. But we'll pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off and keep going.
We are definitely committed to a long-term brand strategy. We are committed to women's health, we are committed to
urology and we are committed to a biosimilar franchise. So we will continue to look for business development
opportunities. I would expect that you'll see some from us over the next few months as we can bring on some of the
deals we're currently working on. But we have not wavered in our commitment to our brand franchise. Fred, did you
want to say anything?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: No, I mean, the only thing to add to that is that, I mean, we've got good solid growth
going on RAPAFLO, good solid growth continuing on CRINONE. Launched Generess extremely successfully in a
very, very crowded market. And continue to focus ourselves on the urology and women's healthcare space very
aggressively. We do hope to bring home an acquisition of either a product or an organization in the very near future,
and continue to search for the right mix.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with Canaccord.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: [inaudible] (57:22) and I want to ask you what your 2015 guidance is, but as people kind
of look past what is going to be a really good growth rate for the next couple of years, and we think some of the moving
parts and sort of the medium term, what areas in the brand space are you focused on? And then, Paul, can you talk
about the biogeneric opportunity? There's kind of two aspects to this. One, we're going to start see some conversion
from the Amgen deal. And the other part of that is the R&D commitments. Can you kind of talk about how those will
play out as we think about the next couple of years?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. Hey, Randall. I'm sorry we missed the little bit in the first part of your question. You
were kind of cut off. I think what you were focused on there was our brand commitment. Is that what it was, or did I
miss that?
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Yeah. I mean, just very specifically, what area in the brand side are you looking at? What
therapeutic classes?

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, we're continuing to focus our development efforts around women's health, and this is
widespread women's health, not just contraception. But we'll continue to look for opportunities of underserved needs in
women's healthcare, and there are those areas. We're looking at new therapies. We're looking at NCEs. We're looking at
new delivery devices, new delivery systems. We're looking across the board at all of the options we have available to
ourselves.
On the urology front, we continue to be focused on that. As we think about going forward, we will continue to look for
opportunities to maybe add on perhaps an additional therapeutic category. We have to be careful about how we
approach that. That's a challenging effort and we would probably need to do a substantial acquisition to get ourselves
into another category. But we haven't certainly said we wouldn't do that. So we are focused on all of those categories.
On the biogeneric opportunity, I think both Watson and Amgen will be speaking a bit more about these opportunities
over the next few months. It turns out Watson and Amgen both have Investor Days very close to one another in January
and February. And we would expect it both of us will talk about that. And you'll be able to get a lot more clarity around
kind of what we're working on and the timing of those products. But that's just the Watson/Amgen collaboration.
As to FSH, we continue to believe that that will be our first biosimilar that comes to market. As you know, it fits very
nicely with our ability to sell products in the U.S. because of the women's healthcare franchise. So, I think we're well
positioned to deal with that. Although, we wouldn't expect to see any major contribution from any of these products,
truly until late 2015 and early 2016.
And then finally the R&D commitment. It is a significant commitment. Nothing comes without a price, and biosimilars
are going to come to with a big price. And that's why I think the assets are so valuable. Many people have talked about
biosimilars, many people have talked about wanting to be in this space. But when it comes down to spending the
money, there's very few companies who are willing to take the P&L hit or willing and able to do the – to spend the
P&L money to invest in these products.
And they are – it is an extraordinary investment, $50 million to $100 million per product. If you're partnered with
somebody, you can obviously – you can defer some of that or offset some of that cost. But to believe that there's going
to be 12 competitors on monoclonal antibodies in the U.S. is just mindboggling to me. I just don't see that. There's just
not enough people who can spend that kind of money to get to that point. There's going to be handful players. I think
that makes these products extremely valuable and we're committed to them for the future.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: And, Paul, do you feel like your current relationships and pipeline assets give you enough
breadth to sort of you don't need to do any more deals in that area right now?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I don't think we need to do anything immediately, but we will continue to look at
additional product opportunities. And we want to be selective on the biosimilars side because of the magnitude of the
cost. If we find things, and I'll use FSH as the example, that fit nicely within our portfolio of things that we can manage
ourselves, that will be good. If we work with Amgen as well as it's been going, we may do additional things with them.
There are multiple opportunities. I don't think we're at the end of our biosimilar development line. We're just not at that
stage right now where we need to add anything.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay.

And your final question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Yes, and I've also been juggling calls. Two questions on the branded side. The first one on the
respiratory side, I guess the – I don't know if you've mentioned that before, but do you expect to be in the U.S. market
with a lot of ICS products in mid-2015 when the Advair and Symbicort patents expire – [ph] composition (1:02:22) has

And, second, you've not mentioned your biosimilar insulin. And I know this is a program you're inheriting and it's kind
of interesting because very few people are developing this for commercial reasons, and I don't know if you've actually
gotten a chance to wrap your head around this yet and decide on what you're going to do with the program?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, Ronny. It's Siggi. I'll take the first one on the respiratory side. So we have a
program – a significant program in respiratory. We announced that we filed the Xopenex HFA product recently.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Congratulations.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: We are building up a group of people to focus on the development. We have had
co-development on some of these products. Will we be in place with the big respiratory product in 2015? It's way too
early to say. We are working very hard on this. Also I think that all the big, big four generic companies are doing and
we are investing a significant amount of money in the respiratory development today and probably growing going
forward. Maybe on insulin, Fred?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah, on insulin, obviously, we're just with day one of the post-the acquisition. The
insulin projects do come to us through a joint venture with Bioton and Actavis. We've met with the management team,
we're meeting with them again over the next couple of weeks and we'll be evaluating that situation. Obviously, there
has not been a lot of success with people developing generics to insulin and to the insulin analogues. The market is also
very well controlled by the current innovators of the product line. And we'll be evaluating as we go forward.
This is a unique opportunity, but one that comes with some reasonable risk and some pretty good competitive control
there. And I would say it's just way too early for us to predict whether this is an asset that will be a strong contributor or
an asset that we'll be evaluating its future.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Great, thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Thanks, Ronny.
