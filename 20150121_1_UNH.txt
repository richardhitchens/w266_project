Good morning and thank you for joining us today.
We enter 2015 with momentum from a strong 2014 finish, and with more growth opportunities and fewer impediments
than we've encountered over the last few years. We expect the strength of our performance capacities to become more
visible in 2015 and even more so in 2016 and beyond as we begin to perform more consistently to the full potential of
this enterprise.
In 2014, both top and bottom line results exceeded the upper range of our original forecasts for the year. 2014 revenues
grew 6.5% to exceed $130 billion and earnings grew to $5.70 per share despite material and well-documented burdens
from the ACA.
UnitedHealth Group's performance in 2014 was highlighted by diversified growth, strong operating and medical cost
management and continuing advances in service, innovation, and enabling technology, positioning UnitedHealth Group
to better serve more people and better respond to the demand of our evolving healthcare system in the coming years.
Cash flows from operations in 2014 exceeded $8 billion or 1.4 times net earnings. With fourth quarter cash flows more
than $2.4 billion, a strong 1.6 times net earnings, reflecting the core strength and quality of our business and earnings.
In 2014, we raised our dividend by 34% to an annual rate of $1.50 per share. We repurchased $4 billion in
UnitedHealth Group shares and return on equity once again exceeded 17%.
As we take a more detailed look at 2014 results, UnitedHealthcare's revenues grew 5.3% to $120 billion. This past year
we experienced outstanding growth in Medicaid and better-than-expected performance across our Medicare portfolio;
balanced off by challenges in the commercial and international markets as we entered the year.
Beginning with Medicaid, organic growth of more than two million people over the last five years, including an
exceptional one million new members in 2014 reflects a decade of strategic and operational decisions that have
prepared us well to serve this ever-expanding population in the states that interest us to administer these programs.
The Medicaid market was the first created by aligned to society's desire to expand care for the uninsured. We have
tuned our medical management and consumer engagement techniques to address the needs and experiences of these
consumers, leveraging the end-market personal-care approach we use today with dedicated on the ground resources
embedded within the communities we serve.
Our footprint in the Medicaid market continues to grow now reaching states where nearly 60% of the Medicaid
community reside. We combine a strong benefit value with deep trusting relationships serving the states and the people
who rely on these programs and benefits.
Today, our community and state business is well-balanced, serving people in more than 100 separate state programs
from children with young families to duly eligible citizens with the most complex medical conditions.
We continue to steadily grow, serving Medicaid with about 60% of our 2014 growth from market expansion and
approximately 40% from traditional sources with year-over-year market share gains and existing programs and
participation in new program launches. We expect to continue this pattern of broad-based growth in 2015 with revenues
expected to grow 15% to 17% this year.
In the senior and retiree market, strong execution drove meaningful growth for UnitedHealthcare Medicare &
Retirement, which added 295,000 seniors in Medicare Supplement products and 215,000 people in standalone Part D.
In Medicare Advantage, seniors continue to value and choose the modern benefits and support services they receive
from managed care. And as you know, sustained government funding shortfalls for Medicare Advantage have hurt
seniors. Cutting back their benefits and causing disruptions as products and markets were withdrawn across the
industry in 2014 including more than 150,000 seniors impacted by our 2014 market and product exits.
Despite this pressure, we grew to serve a net 15,000 more seniors in 2014, a small but hard-won achievement. We will
be back to much stronger growth in 2015, as Medicare Advantage is expected to grow by 200,000 to 300,000
individuals, with Medicare Supplement continuing its longstanding growth pattern, adding another 250,000 to 300,000
people. As we will continue to serve seniors with our leading market position in Part D, we see an overall Medicare

revenue growth rate of 6% to 8% in 2015.
As expected, commercial and international markets were more challenging for us over the past year, but we believe this
is beginning to turn as well. In Brazil, we grew revenues by just under 9% in 2014, with revenue lift provided by
pricing changes and efforts to expand our geographic presence. Price increases clearly pressured membership levels,
but are consistent with realigning our products for a sustainable marketplace going forward. And we expect stronger
market conditions in 2015.
At the same time, Amil's care delivery system of more than 30 strategically positioned acute care hospital facilities and
over 50 clinical practices continues to grow and perform strongly. We are advancing more modern analytics, services,
and technologies across Amil's unique integrated benefits and care delivery platform to better analyze and manage
costs, strengthen fundamental pricing, and improve operational cost structures.
Amil has exceptional brand equity. People recognize the quality of Amil's hospitals and care facilities and the
consistent value its medical and dental benefits offer. Overall, we expect revenues at UnitedHealthcare's global
businesses to grow 5% to 8% in 2015.
UnitedHealthcare commercial revenues retreated 4% in 2014. In 2015 they will increase, and the year is off to a strong
start. Consistent with the strategy we shared with you over a year ago, we participated modestly in the individual
exchange market in 2014, with the expectation of more significant participation as the market matured. This year we
are offering products in 23 state exchanges that are home to 54% of the U.S. exchange market population. This includes
eight of the 10 largest exchange market states and 15 states where we also offer complementary Medicaid plans.
We have enrolled more than 400,000 individuals through individual public exchanges, with four weeks of marketing
still to go. We are ahead of schedule, reflecting the brand value and trust in the UnitedHealthcare name.
Growth in UnitedHealthcare's small group and middle market group health benefit businesses is also better than we had
anticipated in a competitive, but generally, rational market landscape.
The self-funded employer business is positioned for stronger growth and sales performance in 2015 as well, as we
continue to consistently deliver the combination of excellent service and innovation, low medical cost trends, and
flexible customized approaches valued by the sophisticated large multi-market customer.
Looking at the broader picture, UnitedHealthcare has consistently grown by offering differentiated value, service, and
execution to its markets. We've grown organically by more than 8 million people in the past five years. We should
grow to serve over 1 million more people in 2015, continuing UnitedHealthcare's track record as the fastest-growing
health benefits company in the nation. We are confident UnitedHealthcare is positioned for continued growth,
including revenue growth of 6% to 7% in 2015.
UnitedHealthcare delivered strong operating and medical cost performance during the last year. UnitedHealth Group's
consolidated medical care ratio continues to be the best overall metric describing medical cost performance across the
UnitedHealthcare's diverse benefits businesses. That consolidated care ratio of 80.9% improved 60 basis points in
2014, and we expect it to remain stable, in a range of 80.8% plus or minus 50 basis points in 2015.
Medical cost trends in the commercial business were in the 5.5% zone for the year, with great consistency and
execution on medical cost performance across the UnitedHealthcare businesses. Hospital usage per capita was lower
overall again in 2014. It was lower across each of the UnitedHealthcare benefit businesses.
Moving to healthcare services, Optum had a remarkable year in 2014 and is positioned to continue to perform strongly
in 2015. Revenues grew by 25%. Operating margins expanded to 6.9% and earnings grew by 32%, once again, above
the upper end of our expectations for the year. Optum surpassed all of its initial '15 by 15' targets, return on invested
capital, margins, and earnings, all well ahead of schedule. In 2015, earnings are on pace to triple since we embarked on
the One Optum growth initiative a few short years ago.
The fourth quarter was exceptionally strong, with earnings growth of 53%. It was also something of a milestone,
surpassing $1 billion in operating earnings in a single quarter for the first time.

Throughout 2014, Optum increased the quality and depth of its strategic relationships in collaboration with clients and
partners. It combined good solutions with good execution for the complex problems faced by large, sophisticated
customers. This included Optum's assistance to the continued advancement of HealthCare.gov and several state
exchanges during the year. The One Optum commitment to greater alignment, consistent performance, and
cross-business simplification continue to develop well and resonate with the people and customers Optum serves.
A quick profile of each Optum business looks like this. OptumHealth businesses are gaining momentum in the wake of
investments made over the last several years. We expect strong growth in earnings performance in the year ahead.
OptumHealth revenues increased by 11.9% and operating earnings grew by 15% in 2014, all while growing the
numbers of practices operated and patience and payers served in the care delivery business. Today Optum serves over
two million consumers through owned and affiliated physician practices. On the consumer side, Optum is aggressively
deploying better approaches and new technologies for consumer engagement, health and wellness, and personalized
consumer service and support.
At OptumInsight, 2014 revenues grew 10.9%. Operating earnings grew by 21% and the external contract backlog rose
nearly 20%. OptumInsight's $8.6 billion backlog provides a clear indication of the future revenue performance and
services. A prime example here is the unique Optum One analytics platform, which brings together clinical claims,
demographic and care management data to provide both backward and forward-looking views of patient populations
with a rich and distinctive clinical encounter data set of over 55 million lives and expanding rapidly. We expect to
increasingly drive positive impact for care providers and the consumers they serve.
OptumRx grew revenues by $8 billion or 33.2% and operating earnings grew by 67% in 2014 as benefits were realized
from the transition of the UnitedHealthcare commercial pharmacy business. OptumRx won external business awards to
serve well more one million people in 2014 and it's tracking to a similar level of growth in 2015.
The secular trend toward more complex and expensive specialty medications plays directly to Optum's strengths in
synchronizing and integrating medical and pharmacy benefits, providing uniquely personalized service. Optum is
advancing this approach with UnitedHealthcare commercial customers in 2015 and expects to see further market
interest in its capabilities in 2016.
Looking forward to 2015, our expectations remain consistent with those we shared with you at our investor conference
in early December. We're off to a strong start with Optum pursuing large strategic relationships and UnitedHealthcare's
domestic medical membership, some 250,000 people ahead of our investor conference outlook as we close 2014. And
we end with continued strength in early 2015 as we discussed earlier in our remarks.
For UnitedHealth Group, we are projecting high-single-digit percentage revenue growth in 2015 with earnings growth
potentially reaching the double-digits at the upper end of our earnings range. Following established patterns, we expect
first quarter earnings to decrease sequentially from this quarter, but perhaps, not to the levels reflected in current
analyst estimates. From there we expect the second quarter to rise sequentially and quarters three and four to have
smoother progression than in 2014.
We expect performance to further improve in 2015 in a number of key areas and let's spend a minute on those areas of
focus. We expect to grow at a very solid pace capitalizing on market opportunities in commercial benefits, Medicare,
and Medicaid as well as the continuing momentum of Optum. Amil's performance will strengthen in 2015 led by
balanced pricing to address medical cost trends and the use of new approaches, analytics, and technologies to improve
the total performance of both benefits and care delivery businesses.
We are committed in 2015 to growing, strengthening, and deepening customer and consumer relationships at the
enterprise level across the UnitedHealthcare and Optum. In this way, the breadth of services and capabilities can be
dedicated to meet the needs of the largest and most sophisticated customers in healthcare from the federal government,
to the U.S. military, to individual states, national employers, leading hospital systems, life science companies, and to
increase our focus on national health systems in other countries.

This year, we expect to significantly increase the number and quality of these important relationships that we're
privileged to serve. Excellence and consistency in operational execution will remain an important focal point, every
day, all year long, enterprise-wide. Already in late December and January, we quietly on-boarded over 5 million people
to our newly developed Rally consumer engagement digital health platform and almost six million to Advocate for Me,
our consumer support and service technology. And nearly 400,000 physicians are now served through our cloud-based
linked service platform with the goal to reach 600,000 by year-end.
We expect to further advance these and other next-generation consumer-centric healthcare tools in coming months.
Together with updates to our rapidly growing portfolio of mobile applications and cloud-based services, these
technologies will serve to enhance and modernize our overall consumer and care provider experience in 2015.
The key focal point within this area is our commitment to achieving four-star or better performance for at least 80% of
our Medicare Advantage customers by 2018. And 2015 is the year this work gets finished for 2018.
We expect to perform well on medical costs for our customers. We deliver to our customers and members a valuable
package of cost-effective network options and simple useful information about quality and treatment choices supported
by consumer outreach and effective medical management. In 2015, we foresee our volume of care delivered through
value-based contracts, exceeding $43 billion as we help deliver improved cost and quality transparency.
In 2015, we will hold the strong financial disciplines we expect to return capital to shareholders through a rising
dividend and consistent share repurchase while we maintain a disciplined M&A outlook to further strengthen our
capabilities and scale to benefit customers and consumers. Our brand equity and recognition will mature in 2015 with
Optum and UnitedHealthcare each refreshing their efforts to reach consumers and thought leaders across the health
system.
We spoke at the December investor conference about a fresh vocabulary for our enterprise. Words like consumer and
care provider value, precision and consistency in our work, simplicity, driving the last mile in the integration of data,
services and transaction processes, rapid adoption for innovation benefits, serving consumers and care providers,
flexibility, adaptability, and a more urgent pace of change. These themes will become much more than words in 2015.
Every year brings challenges and 2015 will be no exception. How we meet those challenges will define the character of
our enterprise and its leadership team. We expect to continue to build by focusing on serving our customers and serving
you, our shareholders, all year long, driving continued momentum in 2016, 2017 and beyond.
We thank you for your interest this morning. We will now return to your questions. Just one per analyst, please. Thank
you.

[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Thanks. Good morning. My questions are on the commercial risk market. It certainly looked like
membership stabilized in the fourth quarter here and, Steve, you talked about being ahead of plan early in the year. Can
you expand on what is driving that change in membership trajectory and give us an update on the pricing environment
in general? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. So I think this morning I'm going to ask Dave to kind of take point on the
UnitedHealthcare element of questions. So, Dave, do you want to take that and then engage the team?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Sure. Thanks, Justin. I'll just maybe just make a couple of remarks then I'll quickly
turn it to Jeff. Thanks for noticing the progress we made in the commercial risk market in the fourth quarter. That
carried over into Q1 as well. And as you look at it, it is both on and off exchange and I think you'll hear from Jeff that
we have very disciplined pricing as part of that as well. So, Jeff?

<A - Jeff Alter>: Thanks, Dave. Good morning, Justin. It's Jeff Alter. Yes, we had a really nice quarter in 2014 and a
really nice start to 2015, primarily driven by new products we put into the marketplace in reaction to the beginning of
2014 and some of our challenges around price points. So we worked really hard to create products that were tied to
network design and benefit plans that brought a different value proposition to many of our markets.
We first began to see it turn in our membership profile around much better improved persistency of existing accounts.
Then we saw some of our value around affordability helping out our experience-rated accounts. And then as we move
into 2015, I think our exchange expansion also helped create some additional product portfolio advancements off
exchange that have been selling really well.
Your question around pricing, as Dave mentioned, our pricing remains consistent and stable. I think that is also helping
us as others – our pricing may be a little bit to fix the shortfall in their past pricing efforts. And I think the market
remains as stable as we talked about, competitive. And no real change to that portfolio of pricing across the various
markets that we serve.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Great. Thanks for all the color.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Next question, please?
Operator
We can take our next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: Yeah. Maybe if I could ask you to build on that and stay in the commercial market
territory, and maybe you can just tell us what you are seeing in terms of the evolution of the small group market, how
much erosion, if any, you're seeing with coverage, whether that's going to be exchanges or not? And then perhaps more
broadly in commercial what you're seeing with in-group retention with the economy strengthening?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: It's Jeff again. Thanks for the question, Matt. Again, in 2014, we were minor players in the exchange,
so we don't have a lot of information. I will tell you that I think it's well within that range that we've talked about over
the last couple of years. A few percent of that small group market eroding to the exchanges, at least at this point. I think
the growth in the exchanges both in 2014 and in 2015 are really driven by the uninsured and that expansion through the
subsidy. So we have not seen a significant erosion of our small group business.
Just a reminder, over the years, that business has gotten to the point where roughly maybe 50% or 55% of those
employers cover that's down from maybe 60% to 65% in the 1990s. So there has been a continuing erosion of that
market over the years. I think you had a second question around the pricing environment.
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: It was really around that whether you're seeing some in-group attrition whether
you're seeing trends stabilize and to what extent perhaps as a result of the strengthening economy?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Our in-group attrition has flattened. That is probably due to the economy, and then earlier in the year
we did have some in-group attrition that was related to the ACA that has leveled off.
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: All right, thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We're really seeing growth on the exchange, off the exchange, and in the self-funded
marketplace, too.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Correct.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So we're really seeing pretty broad-based response to the offerings we're putting out at this
point in time.

<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: Great.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Next question, please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dave H. Windley>: Thanks. I was going to shift to Optum. Optum and in particular Insight had a really good
fourth quarter margin. I wondered if you could elaborate on that for us and the sustainability of that, and then thinking
about the Optum margin progression over the next two years toward the 8% goal.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Larry?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Dave, it's Larry Renfro. I'm going to ask Bill Miller to participate in this question as well. I
think you probably recall that we have gone through our business plan this year, from the start talking about how the
fourth quarter would end with a couple of things going on. We had a great fourth quarter with the $1 billion in earnings
that Steve talked about. But we were positioned for that quarter to have seasonality. That's our 40:60 split on our
business for the year.
And the planned investments we expect it to kick in and to start to pay off, and OptumInsight would be a part of that
and that's Optum360. And then we had a third area of simplification and integration on our products. My comment on
that is that everything worked as planned. We exceeded slightly the expectations we gave you at our December
conference. So we're off to a very strong fourth quarter and a great start.
I would also say that the question on the 8% by 2016, we believe we're on target. We feel good about that. The
momentum going into 2015 is very strong, obviously, for us, but it's also very strong for our number one customer,
being UHC. So we're still firm and believe that we're good with the 8% by 2016. Bill, any comments on Insight?
<A - Bill Miller>: Obviously, it was a very strong quarter and I think it sets us up very well for 2015 and beyond as
backlog grows. I think there is clearly a recognition that a few of the key things that we're bringing to the marketplace
and have invested in are maturing. There's acceptance, for example, of the Optum360 side of our business, which we
talked a lot about, which is our revenue management platform.
We're well on our way to the customer acquisition that we target. But more importantly and what's exciting is the
results that we're generating for our clients are starting to come through in terms of their financial and operational
performance. We've made investments in data and strengthened our hand particularly from a clinical data standpoint.
That has clearly differentiated us. We had a record quarter and expect another record year with sales, new client
acquisitions, and revenue from our data differentiation both in the provider marketplace and in the life sciences arena as
well. Clearly, we've added critical clients on the government side, working with several states on exchanges.
And then finally, I would say we are really happy with our entry into the position management business, where we're
going into practices in health systems, helping them turn around and help drive better performance quality in their
physician practices. We entered that market last year. We're very confident that that is going to be a strong contributor
for the future of OptumInsight. And so all of those things combined together I think show a lot of diversity in what we
do, a lot of areas to grow and feel pretty confident not only about 2015 but beyond.

<Q - Peter Costa>: Hi. Thanks, guys. You put forth on your Investor Day a view of cost trend rising 50 basis points
faster than it did last year. Some of your competitors have put forth views of trend that's a little bit ahead of that. Why
should we not be concerned that perhaps some of the improving view in membership on the commercial business isn't
because you've perhaps underpriced that business? And specific to that in terms of cost trend, can you talk about how
your view on specialty pharma entity for hepatitis C drugs is evolving this year relative to last year?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Okay. Peter, it's Dave Wichmann. You got a lot in there. I'm going to have Dan
respond to you. I will just maybe comment globally on our ability to manage medical cost and trend. I think it's no
surprise that we've been able to create distinction there vis-à-vis our competition for some time. We do a very good job
of controlling utilization and an excellent job as well in terms of taking a forward view of our cost structures and
putting it into our pricing, which is a discipline we've applied for years now. And I think it has consistently produced
good results. But, Dan, I'll ask you to comment further.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Peter, Dan Schumacher. So let me handle first the medical cost side
and just talk quickly about pricing and then a little bit on hep C. I think those are the three elements you're interested in.
<Q - Peter Costa>: Yes.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: From a medical cost standpoint, just looking at 2014 broadly, we were very pleased with our
medical cost performance. And in the fourth quarter in particular, we again came in a little bit better than what we had
expected. And that's true in our commercial business as well as in our government businesses.
As we look at the utilization under that more specifically, that continues to be very well controlled. Steve did mention
that again this year we were able to drive an absolute reduction in our hospital usage per capita. We did that in each
business, and that was the sixth consecutive year we've been able to drive an absolute reduction in hospital inpatient
usage per capita. So when we put that all together from a commercial standpoint, our cost trend for 2014 came in
actually a little bit better than the 5.5% that we had guided to at the beginning of December as well as at the low end of
the range we guided to a year ago.
As we think about our trend into the future, we have assumed that we're going to see a moderate increase in utilization
in each of our benefits businesses. And that outlook is what informed our pricing as well as our benefit planning. And
I'll tell you, with December behind us and the majority of January behind us as well, we are not seeing any indication
or evidence of an increase in utilization. So we feel very comfortable with our forward outlook. Commercial cost trend
for 2015 is 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.
Sitting here today, we have 75% of our revenue for 2015 locked in. And the vast majority of that revenue comes from
retained accounts. Those are customers that we have experience with, that we understand their performance. So we feel
very comfortable with not only our cost trend outlook, but also in relation to where we are positioned from a revenue
standpoint in our commercial business.
Lastly, you asked about hep C. Obviously, that's a category of significant focus for a lot of people as of late. In 2014,
obviously, we revised our expectations for cost coming out of first quarter and I'll tell you that we tracked very much in
line with that over the balance of 2014. As we look to 2015, we do expect an increase in those costs in each of our
businesses. We've reflected that and captured it in our outlook. So we feel comfortable with where we're positioned.
<Q - Peter Costa>: Can you give us some specifics on how much cost increase you expect in 2015 and precisely what
you're doing regarding negotiating between the various drugs in hep C?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: What I'd tell you, Peter, is that we are constantly working to manage costs and drive greater
value. In this space, we are pleased to see competition. As we look at new product launches, particularly in very high
cost categories, we have a very rigorous process. It's a process that evaluates the clinical equivalency of the drugs. We
look at the effectiveness of each drug. We design clinical programs to ensure appropriate use. And we obviously are
looking at the PDL and formulary implications and then we're negotiating relationships that really drive the best value
for our members and our customers. So we don't talk specifically in this forum about manufacturer relationships, but
rest assured, we are all over this.

<Q - Peter Costa>: Thank you much.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So, Peter, maybe just to close that out, just to be clear. I mean, taking Jeff's comments
earlier and Dan's comments now, I think it's really a product positioning exercise and possibly some firming of the
market that's caused us to advance our business. So I think you can conclude that we're not underpricing the business.
The other thing you can look at is our relative MCR performance for the fourth quarter versus the full year. And if you
look at that, you'll see that that we're performing better in Q4 than we did for the full year. We performed very well for
the full year, but you can see some acceleration in performance as well. So hopefully that closes out that issue. We're
not underpricing.
<Q - Peter Costa>: Thank you much.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next, please?
Operator
And we can take our next question from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Schenker>: Hey, good morning. So if I'm doing my math here correctly, it looks like you guys are
forecasting about 19%, 20% growth in value-based care or care delivered under value-based contracts. Maybe if you
could talk about a little bit about how that's split between commercial, Medicare and Medicaid and also how those
value-based contracts are impacting both your enrollment, are you seeing outsized enrollment in those products, and
then also around your expectations around cost trends? Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Okay. I'll have Dan comment on this. Obviously, this is a key area of focus for us to align
incentives with a delivery system really anchored on advancing quality of healthcare first, but also improving the
affordability of it. Dan?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Andy. So your math is right. Yes, we are expecting about a 20%
increase in the concentration of value-based reimbursement. Going from – we ended the year at about $36 billion of
spend in value-based arrangements and we're looking to drive that north of $43 billion in 2015.
And in terms of the underlying businesses, we're seeing double-digit growth in all three of our businesses, so I wouldn't
highlight any one individually. We're looking to make progress across the spectrum and across the benefits landscape.
And we are seeing contributions to enrollment as a result of those relationships where we partner more distinctly with
certain delivery system partners.
And on the cost side, we're also seeing the outcomes there. We talked at the Investor Day. I know we had a breakout
seminar that talked about driving 1% to 6% aggregate savings from our value-based reimbursement approaches. And
then within that, obviously, the numbers can be more significant based on how they're designed and as well as how
tightly they are aligned around the quality and performance and outcome. So we're very pleased with our progress
there. We're focused on it in 2015 and will be in 2016 and beyond.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think it's important to note the orientation of the quality, and the fact that the structure
actually drives volume towards the better providers that enter into these performance contracts and that we're
progressing these contracts into more sophisticated forms where they're actually taking on even greater performance
responsibility over time. Next question, please?

And we'll take our next question from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.

<Q - Tom A. Carroll>: Hey. Good morning. It sounds like a very confident 2015 outlook. I wonder if you could share
with us a bit more commentary on your operating cost ratio. Fourth quarter's result was relative high driven by the
obvious, but do you think you see that improving in 2015, much like the rest of your business? And where should it go
over the next three years? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We do. Dave, do you want to address that?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Tom, Dave Wichmann.
<Q - Tom A. Carroll>: Hey.
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: So a couple things. First, our operating cost ratio for the quarter was a little bit
elevated at 125 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As you know, this is mainly influenced by the insurers fee, which
amps up that ratio by about 120 of the basis points. But what has been pretty persistent in our business is the mix has
shifted more towards services. And when you see that mix shift, it tends to put a lot of pressure on this ratio. And so
then, that increases it even further and then our productivity efforts bring it back down. And we've seen productivity
well managed across our business, not only offsetting those impacts, but also inflation broadly.
As we look to 2015, the same dynamics play out. You have a little bit of an uptick in the insurer's fee, which further
presses this ratio. But we also see continued growth in Optum and in our fee-based business overall, which tends to
press this forward as well and then we continue to offset that with the productivity improvements year-over-year. We
do expect the ratio to be somewhere around 17% plus or minus 30 basis points for next year and we believe our run in
position supports that.
<Q - Tom A. Carroll>: Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next, please? Next question? Moderator, do you have another – we've answered all the
questions this morning? So we may be having some technical difficulties. We're going...

And our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Hey, there. Optum360 and clearly OptumInsight seems to be tracking kind of ahead of
even what you were expecting last month. Is there any change to your Optum expectations relative to what we saw at
your Investor Day? And then also, what are you expecting in terms of margins on your individual membership on the
public exchanges? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, that's an interesting combination question, Christine. So I'll have Larry take the
Optum side and then we'll respond to the margins on the public exchange business.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Christine, I believe that we are right on target with where we plan to be right now with
Optum360 from what I'll call the planned investment side as well as the implementation operations. I think you know
we have Dignity Health and North Shore as two of our prime customers here. And nothing has really changed from the
investor conference. We were positioning everything to happen in the fourth quarter just as they came through. I don't

know, Bill, if you have any comments?
<A - Bill Miller>: No, I don't think much has changed. I think our business will – depending on what happens with the
ICD-10 changes this year, they didn't happen last year. We overcame that. If they don't happen this year we're prepared
one way or another. But I think we're optimistic and see certainly a pipeline that would lead us to believe that not only
are we on target, but we've got a chance to work ahead, but I'd say, nothing's changed since the investors conference.
And I would say just in terms of customer acquisition, we've always said kind of across our business that we were
looking for these eight to ten rich and deep relationships. And I think if you look across all of the customers we've
acquired, not only in Optum360 but beyond, we're halfway to that goal. We feel very good about achieving that and
certainly we don't see anything in 2015 slowing us down to achieve that.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Christine, maybe I could – it's Larry again. Let me talk about the 10 relationships that Bill
mentioned. We've named two. As we go forward, some of our customers, they do not like to be identified because of
the competition. And so some of the visible ways of looking at that half that we have right now would be to look at
Optum360. It would be to look at our business in the government solutions area. You could look at Optum One, our
data and analytics area and you could look at Optum Labs. So there is some other metrics that I think are going to be
important to look at from this customer acquisition standpoint and I'm going to ask John Rex to maybe hit some of
those metrics as well.
<A - John Rex>: Yeah, good morning, Christine. John Rex here. So a few other things that we look at in terms of
helping illustrate how we're progressing towards that goal of the larger relationships. The average, if you look at since
last couple years, average deal size within OptumHealth is up 80%. The revenue from our top 25 customers within
Optum is up 2.4 times. The number of customers with over 100 million in annual revenue had doubled. We point to our
external backlog being up nearly 20% and a pipeline that about doubled over the last year. So those are other metrics
we look to to help illustrate the impact that we're having in gaining these types of relationships.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And we'll have Jeff respond to the public exchange question.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning, Christine. It's Jeff Alter again. On the individual exchange, we built for our initial
years the margin of 1% to 2% without any reliance on the risk corridors, but we believe longer term it's a 3% to 5%
business and like everything else, we will endeavor to be in the top end of that range as we go forward.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Great, thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next, please, next question.
Operator
Yes. We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks, good morning. Just staying on the public exchanges, can you maybe give us a little
bit of an update on how enrollment is tracking? I think you talked about it being in excess of 400,000. So just
wondering if you expect to exceed the 400,000 to 500,000 range, maybe if there's any disproportionate enrollment in
any state that you're in.
And then lastly, recently in California, it sounds like you tried to get in statewide for 2016, but were denied. Is the plan
just to revisit that in 2017, or are there alternatives you're seeking to still get into that market before then? Thanks.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning, Ralph. It's Jeff Alter again. So let's start with – yeah, we've had about over the
400,000 level in sign-ups. We still feel comfortable within the range that we gave in the investor conference between
400,000 and 500,000, but at this point I'd think more around the 500,000. And depending on how the next week or so
plays out, we could beat that. But right now we feel comfortable within that range.

The good news for us is we're growing where we said we would grow. We're just growing a little bit more in some of
those markets than we thought. So at the investor conference we talked about some of the bigger markets where we
thought we could grow and do well, and that's where we are growing and doing well. So along with our plan, that's
where the growth is coming in.
Now obviously, in California we are disappointed. We wanted to bring more choice and options to the residents of
California. We believe competition is good for them. Unfortunately, we were not able to get agreement from that board
to be in all markets. We did get granted a few markets where there aren't as many carriers as they would like. We're
reviewing that now. So we might be in California in 2016 but in a small handful of markets, and we will go back in, in
2017. We believe choice and competition are good for all markets including California.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And you anticipate that you'll expand your portfolio of markets in the next year?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Yes, outside of California we are working now to expand our footprint into the other markets that we
didn't serve in 2015.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: But we'll do that in a measured way, it's not all...
<A - Jeff Alter>: Yes, we're reviewing those markets now. We'll make some final decisions and let you know.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And the other thing that's nice is not only did you sell in the markets that you wanted, but
you also sold the products that you thought would sell, right?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Correct.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Hi, everyone. Maybe just to ask about Medicare Advantage, obviously, you're looking for an
acceleration in growth. I think 200,000 to 300,000 enrollment was the target at the Investor Day. It looks like in
January with some of the open enrollment season, and you were up at 165,000 adds. Can you just comment on what
you're seeing so far in the open enrollment season and whether that's putting you ahead of your expectations, in line,
and any qualitative comment about the market environment and then any early thoughts on 2016 MA rate notice?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: A.J., it's Dave. I think we've – the team's done a nice job of really re-establishing
growth in the Medicare Advantage individual line. And we've continued our very nice growth on the group MA front
as well, but I'll ask Steve Nelson to comment more broadly on your questions.
<A - Steven Nelson>: Sure. Good morning, A.J. It's Steve Nelson. Yes, we were very pleased with not only how we
ended the year, but how we performed in AEP. As Dave indicated, we drove really strong growth in our group
Medicare Advantage business as a market-leading growth actually, so we're really pleased with that. But we expect
full-year growth in our individual membership as well. And we're particularly excited about that because of the work
we've done with reshaping our network and introducing premiums broadly into our portfolio. We were able to grow in
the markets that were key to us, such as Florida, New York and Texas and Southern California. So really off to a nice
start.
I would say also we saw some really good results and nice start to Medicare Sup as well and across those two products,
really again, off to a good start, a good place to be, in fact, maybe a little bit ahead of where we were thinking, and so
we feel really good about the ranges that we offered last December and feel good about those ranges.
In terms of the 2016 rates, there are a lot of variables that go into the final rate, as you know. And so we don't really
speculate on that. But I will offer that our position has been that it's just a very successful and valuable program for
seniors and it's had great results in medical costs and improving outcomes. Member satisfaction is up and the program

is growing. So we remain strong advocates for our seniors and their healthcare. And we hope and expect that the rates,
when they're finally published, will be fair and appropriate. But overall, we're really pleased with the positioning of
Medicare business and how we're heading into 2015.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: All right, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We may have time for about two more questions. So we'll take a look at that, maybe two
more questions. So the next, please?
Operator
Yes, we can take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Great, thanks. Maybe just two on the MA side of things. Can you talk a little bit about
the stars and how your analysis of what stars has meant for enrollment in 2015? Are you seeing better enrollment in the
places where you have four stars? Are you seeing real issues when your competitors have really moved up on the stars
on the individual side in 2015?
And then also, and obviously, you've grown group very significantly for 2015. Do stars matter as much when we think
about the group business, or is that something that over time you think will impact how group perceives the product as
well?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Maybe I'll start on this. I'd like to make it clear that we believe stars matters and that we're
focused on improving our performance in stars and I think we've been very consistent on that theme. It's not clear that
that has had really an impact with respect to how the product is marketed or acquired in market, but we do believe that
it is important over time; obviously, important from a financial point of view, important in terms of our relationship
with CMS, who basically established those performance guidelines. So I want to make it clear that we are committed to
stars performance. But it's not clear, and I'll ask maybe Steve Nelson to comment that that has had really a particular
impact in terms of market response to product offerings, right.
<A - Steven Nelson>: Sure. Hi, it's Steve Nelson. You're right, Steve. The stars obviously is a factor, but it's one of
many. And so – and it's very – the benefit planning process is one that it has a lot of factors in it and we take all those
things into account. And we look at the results that we've achieved in AEP, this is very much in line with our
expectations. And stars doesn't particularly spike out as the core driver to any of those results.
Again, it's across many factors and a lot of including your brand strength, strength of distribution, the engagement that
you have with providers, and again that, how you design the product. So there's a lot of factors in there. On the group
side, stars is important. It allows you to price competitively and our group membership is enforced our plans. And so
that adds to our ability to grow that membership and that's contributed to that.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Well, I guess the question is, if 2018 feels like a long way away in many respects, but
do you think that you'll be able to grow nicely until you get to that target, you don't need to be at four stars to continue
to grow the MA business in the meantime?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: No. We don't. And one thing that really hasn't been mentioned this morning is that we're
clearly in the zone of our growth expectations for MA and we've actually advanced premiums in a significant way. And
to basically be able to go grow through that, right, Steve?
<A - Steven Nelson>: Absolutely.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: As a percentage of – is pretty impressive and I think bodes well because I think the large
portion of the establishing premium products in markets, a lot of that work got done this year.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Okay, great. Thanks.

Okay. We can take our last question from Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to get back to the commercial business. And I guess the
question is just sort of about the landscape of employers, commercial employer contracts. Basically, what are they
looking for in terms of products?
And then how do you guys quantify the Optum impact? Whether there is a cross-sell of Optum products? Or you
mentioned Rally and Advocate for Me and a couple of these others; do you measure this in new wins or higher
retention levels? And just broadly, what's changing in that landscape where United is now seeing sort of that inflection
point on commercial growth?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So I'll have Jeff respond to that. I do think that the content of the Optum product in the
UnitedHealthcare offering clearly – in the way in which it's applied clearly makes a distinctive difference, but it has a
lot to do with the way in which it's applied in the offerings. But, Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Yes. Good morning, Josh. It's Jeff Alter. So I think again for most everyone of our clients and
employers in general, this is a very important benefit for them for their employees, so they look for the value that can
be provided, but it's also one of their more expensive items. So they look for a partner who can work with them over
the long term to keep affordability in mind, but also deliver great product, service, and innovation. And that's when you
think about the combination of UnitedHealthcare and Optum together working in partnership with the client and their
consultant and their broker to create that plan that works for that employer across sort of a very long time span.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver anything at any point for that client as their business changes and
their dynamics change. We're able to bring in consumer products that Optum builds. Obviously, our close tie to
OptumRx now that specialty medicine is becoming a cost factor, having the close relationship that we have with
OptumRx to embed that inside the medical benefit is vitally important for the value proposition that the employers are
looking for.
And then across the spectrum into OptumHealth, our disease management wellness programs, our consumer
engagements. Employers have spent considerable amounts of money to have disease management wellness programs
and are looking for more engagement and the work that Rally and OptumHealth does to go beyond just creating an
offering, but actually get that engagement and get that uptake to keep people healthier and engaged in their wellness is
vitally important.
So I think what we've seen as the marketplace has stabilized over the last year or so is that that view from employers
looking for a longer-term partner who can work with them to create an even more valuable benefit plan and offering for
their employees, but also be mindful of the cost factors that are involved in it.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. Nobody can really match the breadth of the offerings and the innovation dynamic
and the reliability of continuous innovation, continuous focus on technology so that you're building value year after
year after year, which plays a lot to the retention rates you have, too. So good question and great response.
Stephen J. Hemsley
So thank you very much for joining us this morning. To sum up 2014, UnitedHealth Group has clearly a very strong
year in 2014 and momentum of the business grew throughout the course of the year so that we ended the year perhaps
in our strongest point and have brought that strength into the beginning of 2015. And through consistent execution and
consistent focus on performance, serving customers, the people that we serve, continuing to drive innovation, matched
with strong financial disciplines, we expect our growth to accelerate in 2015 and beyond. We thank you very much for
joining us this morning, and we will see you next quarter. Thank you.
