Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.
Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.
Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thank you for calling in. As you all saw in the press release issued earlier this
morning, Baxter reported strong financial results for the second quarter, which exceeded expectations and we
confirmed our full-year 2014 outlook. Adjusted earnings increased 5% to $1.26 per diluted share and worldwide sales
advanced 16%. Excluding Gambro and foreign currency, Baxter sales rose 5%, driven by solid growth across our
global franchises.
Positive momentum continues to build and Baxter is off to a strong start in 2014. We're driving solid performance
across our entire business portfolio and advancing care in both developed and
emerging markets. This provides a strong foundation to build upon as we improve our competitive position, enhance
operational, commercial and scientific effectiveness, continue to meet challenges posed by the global marketplace and
regulatory environment, and create value for patients, healthcare providers and other key stakeholders. I continue to be
confident in our prospects for the long-term and believe we're well-positioned for sustained performance and success.
Our strong results reflect our strategic focus on improving access to care as we broaden our global presence and
advance the new product pipeline through both internal development and collaborations. During the quarter we
announced an array of pipeline achievements and approvals, advanced R&D collaborations with our partners and made
progress toward the separation into two leading healthcare companies.
First within the BioScience business, we continue to build upon our global leadership position in hemophilia as
evidenced by a number of recent achievements including European regulatory approval of a new manufacturing facility
in Singapore for the production of recombinant proteins, including ADVATE and BAX 855 upon regulatory approval.
Baxter was granted multi-year awards for ADVATE in the U.K. and in Australia where ADVATE was named the
preferred recombinant factor VIII treatment.
Baxter recently received regulatory approvals for ADVATE in Turkey and Russia, supporting efforts to increase access
to recombinant treatments in emerging markets. With these approvals, ADVATE is now approved in 62 countries
worldwide. In addition, the FDA granted approval for the BAX JAK3 reconstitution system, which reduces the number
of steps in the reconstitution process for patients and caregivers. And we recently received European approval for
myPKFiT, which is a new web-based individualized dosing device for prophylactic treatment. This device allows
physicians to calculate personalized ADVATE treatment regimens based on patient's information and individual
pharmacokinetic profiles.
Lastly, we've now completed dosing for all patients in the Phase III clinical trial for BAX 855. To date we have no
reports of inhibitors or drug-related serious adverse events. We look forward to sharing the top line data in the third
quarter and continue to expect to file in the U.S. before the end of the year.
In addition to our internal R&D accomplishments, we're collaborating with partners on advancing R&D programs in
new disease areas with high unmet medical needs, which capitalize on our core technical capabilities, expertise and
global channels. Progress to highlight includes, first, initiation of two Phase III trials for an investigational etanercept
biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis by our partner Coherus Biosciences. As you know,
Baxter has obtained exclusive commercial rights for Europe, Canada, Brazil and certain other markets.
Second, the announcement by our partner CTI BioPharma on the completion of enrollment in its PERSIST-1 pivotal
trial of pacritinib, a novel oral JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor for patients with myelofibrosis, a chronic malignant bone marrow
disorder. This is the first of two Phase III trials required to support regulatory approval. PERSIST-2 began earlier this
year and is evaluating patients with low platelet counts for whom no viable treatment exists today. CTI and Baxter will
jointly commercialize pacritinib in the U.S. and Baxter has been granted exclusive rights for all indications outside the
U.S.

And finally, we continue to augment our portfolio with acquisitions like Chatham Therapeutics, which we announced
last quarter, and AesRx, which we announced just last week. AesRX is a private U.S. biopharmaceutical company
focusing on sickle cell disease with its development program Aes-103. This investigational oral prophylactic treatment
is currently being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial and has the potential to address an extremely high unmet clinical
need in a community with inadequate treatment options and no recent major clinical advancements.
Moving on to Medical Products business, recent highlights include the presentation of data at a European renal
conference supporting the safety and efficacy of the VIVIA hemodialysis system. As you know, the VIVIA system
completed CE marking in Europe late last year and is currently being introduced on a limited basis in 2014. In the U.S.
we continue to engage in productive dialogue with the FDA regarding the design of our final clinical trial supporting a
nocturnal indication and we're working towards initiating this trial before the end of the year.
In addition, Baxter received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our next-generation SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump
offering an option for wireless connectivity and integration of data into a hospital's electronic medical record. Before I
turn the call over to Bob to review our financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to take a
moment to outline the progress we're making to create two separate, independent global healthcare companies.
First as you know, we've named Bob Hombach Chief Financial Officer of the new biopharmaceutical company and Jay
Saccaro Chief Financial Officer of Baxter International following completion of the transaction. I've had the pleasure of
working directly with Bob and Jay for many years and I'm confident that both businesses are positioned for future
success given their deep knowledge of these businesses, financial expertise, and their leadership qualities.
In addition, last week we announced the appointment of Dr. John Orloff as Vice President and Global Head of R&D for
Baxter BioScience. Dr. Orloff will be responsible for advancing the late-stage BioScience pipeline, enhancing the
current R&D operating model and pursuing additional innovative opportunities for the business. Dr. Orloff joins
BioScience from Merck Serono Pharmaceuticals where he served as Global Head of Clinical Development.
We continue to work diligently to prepare the organization for the spin-off and expect to announce additional senior
leadership appointments in the coming months. In addition, we're currently targeting the filing of a preliminary Form
10 with the SEC before the end of the year. We're planning to host an investor conference in New York in the second
quarter of 2015 to provide details on both companies, and we expect to finalize the transaction by mid-2015.
As always, I'd be happy to address questions on this or any topic during the Q&A this morning, but with that, I'll now
turn the call over to Bob.
Robert J. Hombach
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second
quarter advanced 5% to $1.26, which exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $1.18 to $1.22 per share. This
overachievement can primarily be attributed to strong sales across several franchises including cyclophosphamide in
the absence of any new competition and the favorable timing of a large FEIBA shipment originally scheduled for the
third quarter. These items each drove favorability versus our guidance of approximately $0.02 per diluted share,
respectively.
As we mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $0.95 per diluted share included net special items totaling
$172 million or $0.31 per diluted share primarily for intangible amortization and costs associated with contingent
revenue and product development milestone payments, remediation efforts related to the in-progress Spectrum Infusion
Pump recall, integration of the company's acquisition of Gambro, and Baxter's planned separation into two independent
healthcare companies. These charges were partially offset by the reversal of certain business optimization and litigation
reserves.
Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2014. Starting
with sales, worldwide sales of approximately $4.3 billion advanced 16% on both a reported and constant currency basis
driven by solid growth across our global franchises. This performance exceeded our sales growth guidance range of

12% to 13%. Excluding Gambro revenues of $408 million, Baxter sales rose 5% on a constant currency basis.
In terms of individual business performance, Global BioScience sales exceeded $1.7 billion and advanced 7% in the
second quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 6%. Within the product categories, Hemophilia sales of
$904 million increased 6% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We continue to capitalize on our global
leadership position and brand differentiation, new product launches including the new FEIBA prophylactic indication
and RIXUBIS for the treatment of hemophilia B, and increased penetration of recombinant therapies particularly in
emerging markets.
Specifically, global demand for ADVATE remains very strong, resulting in double-digit growth for the quarter and
year-to-date. This reflects the positive patient experience with our brand and ongoing benefits derived from our
prophylactic label expansion augmented by shipments to Brazil as part of our ongoing collaboration with Hemobrás to
enhance access to recombinant factor VIII therapy. To date, we have converted more than 35% of the 10,000
hemophilia A patients in Brazil and continue to expect to generate sales of more than $100 million in 2014.
In addition, global demand for FEIBA remains robust. We are benefiting from the new prophylactic indication in the
U.S. where we generated double-digit growth this quarter and we recently received approval in Canada, Australia and
Japan. As you may recall, only 15% to 20% of inhibitor patients globally are treated prophylactically, presenting a
significant long-term growth opportunity for our hemophilia franchise.
In BioTherapeutics, sales of $548 million increased 7% on a reported basis and increased 6% on a constant currency
basis. This reflects sequential improvement driven by enhanced product availability and growth of immunoglobulin
therapies, albumin, and alpha-1 treatments. Consistent with last quarter, U.S. sales increased 7% while international
sales were up 4%. International growth was marked by improved growth for immunoglobulin therapies and albumin as
we've resumed albumin shipments to China. While U.S. growth may moderate in the second half of the year due to
tough comparisons, we expect international growth to accelerate on a sequential basis in the third and fourth quarters.
In BioSurgery, sales totaled $189 million and increased 6%. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 5% driven by
increased penetration for surgical sealants like TISSEEL and FLOSEAL, particularly outside the U.S. As you know,
growth of these products is tied directly to growth in surgical procedures, which remains very modest.
Finally, Vaccine revenues totaled $110 million and increased 12%. Sales grew 6% on a constant currency basis driven
primarily by strong sales of the FSME vaccine, which was partially offset by lower milestone payments related to
government collaborations for the development of influenza vaccines.
In Medical Products, global sales of more than $2.5 billion increased 24% on both a reported and constant currency
basis. Excluding Gambro, Medical Products sales grew 4% on a constant currency basis.
Within the product categories, Renal sales totaled $1 billion, which includes the contribution from Gambro of $408
million. Excluding Gambro, Renal sales of $636 million declined 3% or 1% on a constant currency basis as expected.
PD patient gains in the U.S. have never been stronger, driving U.S. PD growth of 15%. However, this was more than
offset by lower international sales, which were impacted by the timing of certain tenders, which we discussed last
quarter, and the divestiture of the CRRT business. Excluding these items, which totaled approximately $40 million,
global Renal sales increased approximately 4%.
Sales in the Fluid System category of $816 million increased 8% on a reported and constant currency basis.
Performance continues to be driven by favorable demand and pricing for IV solutions and other injectables, particularly
for cyclophosphamide. As you may know, to date we have not experienced any new competition for cyclo and we've
updated our full-year guidance to reflect our new assumption. On a year-to-date basis, U.S. cyclophosphamide sales
totaled approximately $225 million.
Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies, posted sales of $404
million, reflecting an increase of 10%. Sales rose 9% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by increased
penetration of Suprane in markets outside the U.S. and high single-digit growth of our global nutrition franchise.

Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $249 million and declined 3%
on a reported basis or 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance can be attributed primarily to the timing of
shipments and lower third-party demand, which was partially offset by strong pharmacy compounding revenues.
Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter was 50.7% compared to 53.0% last year. Margin expansion
in the base Baxter business resulting from mix benefits was more than offset by the impact of the lower-margin
Gambro business and foreign currency, which collectively reduced the rate by approximately 250 basis points.
SG&A totaled $961 million and increased 18%, with the Gambro acquisition accounting for the vast majority of the
growth. Excluding Gambro, SG&A increased 4% as leverage was derived from benefits associated with our business
optimization initiatives. This was partially offset by select investments in promotional and marketing initiatives for new
product launches and within international markets to enhance our global presence, and the incremental expedited
freight charges to support the strong demand we are seeing in the U.S. Medical Products business.
R&D spending in the quarter of $292 million increased 15% versus the prior year. Excluding Gambro, R&D spending
rose 2%. We continue to advance the new product pipeline and accelerate investments in a number of areas, including
programs in our leading hemophilia franchise, both leveraging our expertise in the therapeutic areas of hematology,
oncology and immunology, and investments in renal therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes across the
continuum of care.
The operating margin in the quarter of 21.3% is lower than last year's operating margin of 23.8%. Excluding Gambro,
the operating margin was 23.5% as positive mix was offset by foreign currency and investments in SG&A and R&D.
Interest expense was $42 million in the second quarter, which reflects debt issuances to fund both the Gambro
acquisition and the Covington plasma manufacturing site.
Other income totaled $17 million driven primarily by the favorable foreign exchange impact on balance sheet positions.
The tax rate was 21.8% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings
per share per diluted share advanced 5% to $1.26.
For the first half of 2014, cash flow from operations was strong and totaled approximately $1.2 billion reflecting an
improvement versus last year. DSO ended the quarter at 56.7 days and, excluding Gambro, Baxter's DSO was 53 days,
slightly lower than the prior year. Inventory turns of 2.2 are comparable to the prior-year period, and lastly, in the first
half of the year, we repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares for $450 million or on a net basis, 2 million shares
for $218 million in line with our full-year objective.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the third quarter and full
year 2014. For the full year, we now expect adjusted earnings of $5.10 to $5.20 per diluted share. We continue to
provide a wider guidance range than our historical practice as the number of factors and assumptions impact the
outlook in the second half of the year particularly potential headwinds related to cyclophosphamide competition and
foreign currency.
As mentioned earlier we have updated our assumptions for cyclophosphamide competition, while this has resulted in a
transitory benefit, it also provides the opportunity to accelerate investment that will better position both BioScience and
the Medical Products businesses for sustained success going forward. For the full year, the cyclo benefit is currently
estimated to be more than $0.20 per diluted share. This benefit will largely be offset by incremental investments we are
making across the portfolio and by absorbing a foreign currency impact of almost $0.25 per diluted share in 2014,
which is approximately $0.10 per share higher than our original expectations.
Specifically, by line item of the P&L starting with sales, we now expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign
currency of approximately 10% to 11% which includes annual sales of more than $1.6 billion for Gambro. At current
foreign exchange rates we expect reported sales growth of approximately 9% to 10%. Excluding Gambro, we expect
the base Baxter business to grow approximately 3% on a constant-currency basis. For the full year we continue to
expect gross margin for the company to decline by approximately 150 basis points from the 2013 margin of 52%.
Positive sales mix in the base Baxter business is more than offset by Gambro and the full-year foreign currency impact
of approximately 100 basis points.

In terms of expenses, we continue to invest to support the elevated level of sales reflected in our guidance as well as
accelerated spending in sales and marketing to support new product launches and R&D investments primarily related to
recent business development activity within BioScience while making increment investments in our Medical Products
operations to enhance our operational effectiveness. As a result, we now expect R&D and SG&A to grow in high single
digits for the full-year, representing an increase of approximately $200 million versus our original 2014 expectations.
This includes an incremental impact from foreign currency of approximately $50 million.
We expect interest expense to total approximately $160 million and we now expect other income of approximately $70
million for the full-year, the vast majority of which has already been recognized in the first half of the year. We expect
a tax rate of approximately 21.5% and we expect a full-year average share count of approximately 547 million shares,
which assumes approximately $300 million in net share repurchases.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.5
billion, which excludes the cash costs associated with the spin-off of the biopharmaceuticals business. We expect
capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes Gambro and the investments we are making to
enhance our plasma manufacturing footprint in Covington, Georgia.
Let me move to sales and expand on our assumptions for the two businesses and the major product categories.
Beginning with Medical Products, on a constant-currency basis, including the contribution of Gambro, we now expect
sales growth of approximately 14% to 15%. Excluding Gambro, we expect sales for Medical Products to grow 1% to
2%.
Specifically, we expect Renal sales to grow approximately 40%, including the benefit of continued PD penetration and
the incremental revenue contribution from Gambro. We now expect fluid system sales to be flat to up 2% reflecting a
benefit of approximately $150 million relative to our original guidance. We are now assuming that we experience
competition for cyclophosphamide later this year, reducing sales by approximately $50 million to $75 million
compared to sales in the second half of 2013. We continue to expect Specialty Pharmaceutical sales, which includes our
nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics, to grow in the 3% to 5% range and we expect our BioPharma Solutions
sales to be flat for the full year.
For BioScience, we are also raising our guidance and now project sales growth, excluding foreign currency of 4% to
5%. Our outlook includes sales growth in our global hemophilia franchise of 5% to 6%. While we continue to expect
increased competition for recombinant factor VIII therapies in the second half of this year, performance will be fueled
by underlying global demand for ADVATE, conversion to recombinant therapy in Brazil, new tender awards, and
continued benefits from new product launches including RIXUBIS and FEIBA prophylaxis.
For the BioTherapeutics franchise, we continue to expect growth of approximately 4% with sales of immunoglobulin
therapies and albumin in China ramping up in the second half of the year. And finally for our BioSurgery and Vaccine
businesses, we now expect growth in the low to mid-single digits.
As mentioned in our press release for the third quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share excluding special items of
$1.28 to $1.32. We expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of 12% to 13%. Excluding Gambro,
we expect the base Baxter sales at constant currency rates to grow approximately 4% to 5%.
Thanks and now we'll open up the call for Q&A.

opened.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on a strong quarter. I
wanted to get right to kind of the key controversy surrounding the stock right now, which is the sustainability of your
hemophilia franchise. You raised hemophilia guidance for the back half of this year. At the same time, you are starting
to see the competition now coming from the longer-acting factor VIIIs.
Just wondering if you could kind of comment on is that hemophilia guidance raise coming from the confidence in
sustainability of your ADVATE franchise in the face of competition or is it coming more from some of these other
growth drivers that you mentioned. Just give us a little bit more color how you're thinking about that business moving
forward. Thank you.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Bob and Ludwig, do you want to respond to Derrick's question?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Sure. Hi, Derrick. This is Ludwig. So overall, we're very pleased with the hemophilia
performance. As Bob was saying, we are increasing our sales guidance. I think the confidence is coming from a
different angle. First of all, we feel that our ADVATE gold standard position is a strong position in that we believe that
we will be able to continue to grow ADVATE's position through different vectors.
In addition to that, we have new products coming in. We have RIXUBIS. In addition to that, the FEIBA prophy
indication is also a strong growth driver. In addition to that, we have geographical expansion playing a role. So overall,
we feel good about the guidance that we gave you and we believe it's coming from different angles here.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Could you perhaps quantify a little bit more for us the opportunity from the recent o-U.S. tender
wins and the launches in Russia and Turkey of ADVATE, as well as maybe, Bob, if you can just give us a sense for
how much Brazil is contributing this quarter?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Sure, Derrick. The tender wins in Australia and the U.K. will start ramping up
activity here in the back half of 2014. So relative to our expectations – and we did have good line of sight on one of
those two to begin with, so relative to our expectations, not much of an incremental contribution here in 2014.
But as we move into 2015 and beyond, these are multi-year tender awards and I think position us to significantly
increase our market share in the U.K. where it had gotten down to below 10% at one point here. And as you know, we
were completely out of the Australian market and now we have the preferred position. So we've not specifically
quantified that opportunity at this point, but for both of them it will be a meaningful opportunity to grow internationally
in a key franchise for us.
As it relates to Brazil, as I've mentioned before, we're going to experience some lumpiness here as we continue to ramp
up conversion and continue to open up the opportunity for different segments within Brazil. And so again, we're
projecting more than $100 million of sales here. The contribution in the second quarter was fairly modest. We do
expect that to ramp up throughout the course of the back half of this year, so more than half of that $100 million is
going to happen in the back half.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Maybe one final follow-up to Ludwig's comments, Ludwig, can you maybe just give us a little
bit more detail now that the Biogen longer-acting is in the market and that you've seen the label? Could you just maybe
give us a little bit more detail on your expectations for the impact from that versus what you were thinking before as
you've seen the label, and any additional color on the early progress of their launch and how you're specifically
detailing against that competition? Thank you.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yes, Derrick. I think that the label is not much differentiated from the ADVATE label. If
you look at the ADVATE label, it has very strong annual bleed rate data in there which is unsurpassed and which is
still, from a patient perspective, the most important thing. We also have individualized PK in our label. We have every
three-day dosing in the label. And when you look at the use of ADVATE, our ADVATE prophy patients are on an
every three-day or longer dosing regimen already.

And so the data that we've shared with all of you are survey data that comes from patients and healthcare providers tells
us that, yes, the interest of the community is there for a longer-acting but the definition of a longer-acting for
hemophilia A is one once a week, or a longer dosing regimen. So our expectation is the same as the guidance that we
gave you and that is we expect a single-digit impact on our ADVATE market share till BAX 855 comes on board. Bob
talked about the fact that we've completed the enrollment. We completed all the assessments. We're on track to share
BAX 855 data with you third quarter and we're still on track for a submission by the end of this year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Larry S. Keusch>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. For Bob Hombach and then I have one for Bob Parkinson. I just
want to make sure I'm understanding the cyclo updated guidance. So are you saying now that you obviously haven't
seen any competition yet and now you're thinking later in this year? And on top of that, I think you had been initially
anticipating about a $0.25 impact. Are you now saying it's $0.20? Again, I just want to make sure I'm getting that all
correct.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: No. No. No. We're now expecting competition to enter late Q3 to early Q4. We had
previously guided to a potential negative impact of $0.20 to $0.30 that we baked into our initial guidance and from that
initial guidance, we're saying that's going to get a little bit more than $0.20 better. So we are going to have
improvements relative to our expectations around cyclo, original expectations of a little more than $0.20.
<Q - Larry S. Keusch>: Okay. And then you mentioned the investments that you're going to make against that. So
how do we sort of think about the net impact of all of this?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Well, yeah, the net impact, as you know, we didn't change our overall guidance. So I
talked a little bit about a pretty significant ongoing currency headwind that we're incurring here of an incremental $0.10
to our expectation as well. So that's largely half of it. The rest of it relates to incremental investments that we're
making. And as you know, we did a couple of business development deals here recently in gene therapy for hemophilia
A as well as an acquisition for a sickle cell anemia treatment.
Those are going to come with R&D burns with them and so that is going to ramp up our R&D spend, that and a few
other things about $50 million in for the rest of this year. And then we're making incremental investments to support
numerous new product launches, primarily in BioScience and SG&A, that really those two make up the bulk of the
difference between the $0.20 benefit from cyclo in the $0.10 downside related to FX.
<Q - Larry S. Keusch>: Gotcha. And then I guess for Bob and maybe for Ludwig, obviously, post the Medtronic and
Covidien deal and some of these other ones that are getting announced, clearly scale is something that seems to be
thematic out there. You guys obviously are going to initially get smaller with the spin-off, so I'm wondering if you
could sort of discuss a little bit about how you guys think in the individual businesses, the needs to get better and to get
bigger and sort of perhaps the strategy behind that?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah, let me make maybe some general comments for both businesses and then more
specifically regarding new BAX and if Ludwig wants to comment on new Bio going forward. Stating the obvious,
we're consumed right now with activities associated with the spin. So it's not about, at this stage, thinking about getting
bigger. It's about really moving forward to execute effectively the spin. Of course, one of the strategic motivations
behind the decision itself was to increase the focus in both businesses.
I can tell you from a new BAX perspective, if you will, we feel there's significant opportunities to grow earnings at a
faster rate than sales as a result of a number of things, but one of which is to, to your question I think aggressively
managing portfolio whether that's business, product, geographic portfolio, and so on. And I think you can anticipate
post-spin activity in that regard. That also sets the stage then I think to be proactive in terms of BD acquisitions and so
on to kind of reshape, if you will, the portfolio that comprises new Baxter going forward.

But again, those are things we're evaluating right now but not spending a lot of time on given the focus of the energy,
Larry, is really on the spin. Ludwig, I don't know if, from a new Bio perspective, if you want to add anything to that? I
think probably it describes the intention of your organization right now as well.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Correct. I think the question is not how do we get bigger here. I think the question is
finding the right opportunity within these areas that we're focusing on, which is immunology and hematology,
oncology. And I think the question now, can we make a difference in patient's lives and how can we bring value?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah, I think that's a good summary. In fact, I think you said it. It's not about getting
bigger at this stage. It's about getting better. And the spin, at its heart, was really about intensifying the focus in each of
the businesses so that we can be better both from an innovation point of view as well as how we launch and
commercialize our products and manage the portfolios in both businesses. So the question of getting bigger is
something we always think about but I would tell you right now it's not really front burner, Larry.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now opened.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Bob Hombach, I just want to come back to the margins here for a second. I
understand the discretionary spending in the back half of the year, but as it relates to the second quarter, were some of
these discretionary spending items present in the second quarter? Because obviously we would expect a little more
upside here in the second quarter relative to expectations given the very strong revenue?
And then, Bob, some of the things you described are discretionary in nature in the back half of the year. How much of
those carry forward into next year? Because some of these you described are more baseline spending on some of the
new JV initiatives and some, I imagine, you can modulate pretty good heading into 2015. So can you give us a sense of
whether these items are 2014 discretionary or linger into 2015? And then I have a quick follow-up.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Okay. As it relates to second quarter, there was a fairly significant impact to gross
margins. We did see some incremental SG&A, not so much in R&D yet but as I mentioned the two new acquisitions
really are just going to start impacting BioScience from an R&D run rate perspective in the second half of this year.
But from a gross margin perspective, the impact was pretty significant in the second quarter primarily from FX. And
the driver there really is the euro. And as you know, as we've talked about in the past given our global footprint, we
have significant sales in Europe in the base Baxter business. Gambro had more than 50% of their sales in Western
Europe as well, so that actually increased our exposure on the sales line, which is a good thing, but on the cost side,
historically we've been able to mute most of euro fluctuations at the gross margin line through a combination of our
manufacturing footprint and financial hedging that we do.
But as we've added Gambro into the mix, Gambro actually has a disproportionate amount of their manufacturing
footprint in Europe and so their cost relative to revenue was much higher in Europe. So in fact, the very strong euro that
we saw in the second quarter was a pretty meaningful negative to gross margin because sales were higher related to the
FX translation but costs were even higher. And so that pretty meaningful gross margin impact, as we mentioned,
between that and Gambro at 250 basis point negative on gross margin. So the lack of drop through in the second
quarter, more is related to gross margin, primarily FX, and less to do with these incremental investments, which again
are primarily back half.
And then, as it relates to discretionary, clearly the R&D run rate for those two acquisitions is going to be there going
forward. The SG&A and new product launches, those certainly can be modulated and that's what we're doing now. We
do have a plethora of new products to position in the market over the next 6 months to 12 months, and we're going to
make sure we make the right investments there, but we do have a bit more flexibility on that.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Helpful. Thanks, Bob. And then, Bob Parkinson, just as you think about the spin
heading into next year, obviously, one of the biggest drivers of the Medical Products business will still be Gambro and

the broader Renal franchise. So maybe you can give us an update here over the last six months, where do you think you
stand as it relates to the organic growth profile you expected at Gambro? There's capacity coming back online and
some of the cost opportunities that you saw. How would you give us sort of summation of where Gambro sits across
some of those metrics? Thank you.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah, Dave, I would say, first of all, at a high level, we're tracking very well with the
original expectations. More specifically in terms of the cost synergies, again, tracking just maybe a little bit behind in
the short term but longer term we feel that the target we communicated to you is more than achievable, encouraging
early returns, I think, on commercial synergies.
So when you look at the size of the business in terms of revenue, what's becoming increasingly evident is the way to
really monitor this business is more broadly what we call Baxter-Gambro-Renal now because we are seeing in the
marketplace the expectation that the full complement of products would lever the legacy Baxter businesses, peritoneal
dialysis and obviously home hemo going forward. In fact, if you look at our total Renal business, revenue growth
continues to perform very well. And so, in that sense, in terms of the revenue line, we continue to be very optimistic
that we will achieve if not exceed the original expectations.
Having said that, on the legacy Gambro business, we continue to focus on ramping up capacity specifically in the
dialyzer area, which is going to continue to be a challenge over the next year or two, simply stated. There's more
demand right now than our ability to deliver. You note some of the historical issues that the previous owners of
Gambro were dealing with in that regard and so on. But we're moving forward to expand capacity in our two primary
dialyzer facilities in Hechingen, Germany and Opelika, Alabama. And it's just a matter of time before we get that
capacity ramped up so that we can accelerate the growth of the dialyzer business.
The acute business and the hospital is growing very nicely. And the monitor business, we're pleased with how the
monitor business is performing, specifically some of the reliability improvements and so on. So without getting more
granular, I would say again back where I started at a high level, things are tracking very nicely with our expectations.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to start with I think the announcement, it
was yesterday and you highlighted it today on the call the initiation to Phase III trials in etanercept. Maybe you can just
talk a little bit more about what you see the U.S. regulatory pathway being for your biosimilars program and how we
should sort of expect that to unfold over the next couple of years.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Hi, David. It's Ludwig. I think, as you said, it's evolving. I don't think everybody has the
answers here. But for us it's critical that this is an opportunity to create access to those molecules. We're building a
portfolio. We believe that a portfolio, of course, for us is critical, so we're building this portfolio and at this moment we
have three molecules, one with Coherus and two with Momenta.
I think there is an opportunity within the regulatory pathway to go for interchangeability. Of course, that's going to
depend on finalizing those regulations as well as what are the product characteristics, but we believe that we are in a
strong situation at least with one of the approaches that we have to shoot for, interchangeability. I think you've seen that
at least one of the molecules is in Phase III. The other molecules continue to advance in development so stay tuned.
We'll know more as we move forward here.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: And, David, specifically related to etanercept, remember we have o-U.S. rights in Europe
and several markets outside the U.S. so it's not a product that we'll have rights for in the U.S.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up maybe to Bob Parkinson's comment I think in
response to one of the earlier questions about leverage in the business and you did reference the potential for the
remaining Baxter International to generate revenue growth, and then earnings with earnings growth pacing at a faster

rate.
Could you maybe just talk about the opportunity set there? Because one of the things that stands out to us, at least when
you look at your quarterly or annual filings, is the extent to which the current medical product margin sits below peers
and I assume we'll see more in the Form 10 but maybe you just preview for us some of the opportunities that exist there
to close the gap in your Med Products margin versus peers that has the potential to drive outside earnings growth for
some period of time.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Sure, David. Well, first of all, kind of at a high level, everybody focuses on the
creation of the BioScience spin-off as a new public company, but I will tell you our mindset is we're creating two new
companies here. The spin-off of BioScience provides the legacy Baxter business, which as you know I will run going
forward, I think an opportunity to reevaluate anything and everything that we do and I think that's really healthy and
that's the mindset that we're embracing.
First of all, I think intensifying focus on higher margin growth areas, product categories like anesthesia, parenteral
nutrition. Certainly the BioSurgery business, which while we've developed that market very nicely in the U.S.,
continues to be very undeveloped in many markets outside the U.S.
Also, infusion pumps. With the approval of the SIGMA Spectrum a month or so ago and the anticipated launch later
this year with that, it's going to put us in a position to play offense in infusion pumps for the first time really in many
years. If you look at the margin accretion opportunity over the next five years or so in the infusion pump business for
us to regain the share that we lost over the years in the U.S. due to the COLLEAGUE situation and then be able to
expand outside the U.S. There's probably $0.30, $0.35 of EPS equivalent associated with margin accretion
opportunities just in the infusion pump area. So anesthesia, nutrition and infusion pump, BioSurgery all higher-margin
areas will benefit from intensified focus and, as I mentioned, infusion pumps benefiting from now the ability to play
offense with the recent approval.
I commented earlier then on the opportunities in terms of portfolio and I think that there's significant opportunities to
evaluate, as an example, core businesses like IVs. In certain markets, the IV business where we can bundle with a
contract that includes the disposable sets, the infusion pumps, the secondary, the MINI-BAGs, the pre-mixes and so on
continues to be a very attractive business from a return on investment.
In certain markets where we're on IVs where we're contracting separately for IVs – these are largely international
markets – I think we really need to be more aggressive in terms of evaluating what is the sustainable value of these
businesses. And so that's the kind of example from a portfolio of geographic, in that sense, the kind of things that I
think we will be much more proactive in.
I also think in terms of this new mindset and I'm challenging the organization to evaluate really new paradigms in a lot
of different areas. This recent IV shortage in the U.S. I think has sensitized a lot of people to the value of these
products, products that largely have been taken for granted historically, which are essential to saving and sustaining
lives. And I described that it always is the best deal in healthcare to be able to pay for half a liter or a liter of IV a lower
price than a bottle of water at 7-Eleven that kind of puts it in perspective.
And I think there's opportunity there in terms of taking prices up and really getting value commensurate with the value
that those products serve clinically and so on. So I'll stop there. I would just tell you I'm very excited to really lead this
new organization and I think focus on those areas for margin accretion that exist. So this will be a subject we'll talk a
lot about in the coming months and certainly post-spin as we crystallize more specifically. But there's fertile ground
here, I believe, to support my earlier comment about being able to drive earnings growth at a much faster rate than
revenue growth in this new business.

<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thank you for taking the questions. First one, Bob Hombach, when you had the late
March call to announce the separation, it sounded like you still had a fair amount of work to do to put some numbers
behind the separation costs. Have you had any additional work done on what you think the dilution from the spin will
be, meaning really for you guys will be all the incremental overhead that'll have to be created? And I think you said at
that time you didn't expect any tax leakage so has there been any change there? Thanks.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, no change on the view on tax leakage, as I mentioned. I think transactionally as we
create legal entities and move assets and people in various countries around the world there may be small amounts,
which we'll call out as separate, special items. But in terms of ongoing tax rate for the two businesses, no change in
prior view, nothing significant we see for either business here at this stage.
As it relates to synergy, we're certainly working diligently internally to estimate what growth synergies are going to be
and then how we're going to go about mitigating them, how much before the spin occurs and how we will be able to get
out the cost position over the first year or two. Again, we're not seeing anything significant or different than what our
consultants would say benchmarks look like. So nothing has popped up and no red flags from what I said before that I
think we are largely going to be in line with the type of operational dis-synergy you've seen from other spin-offs.
I would say though that our international footprint, which represents 60% of our sales on an annual basis, we are very
integrated. It will be very complicated to separate the two businesses. But I think as we create a new biopharmaceutical
company in an international framework, we'll be able to do that in a fairly streamlined way. So again, there may be a
little bit of extra dilution on day one related to international but nothing significant.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. And then can you give us an update on maybe – well, maybe two items here. So,
one, you haven't talked about recently the plans for the Vaccine business. Has there been any progress there? And then
two, we've got the HyQvia panel coming up at the end of the month. Can you set expectations for what we'll see that
will be new in the panel pack and how do you expect the language from the FDA to read in the panel pack? Thanks.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Bob, do you want to handle the Vaccines? And then...
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, certainly. As we mentioned earlier this year, we did take the strategic decision to
look at, first, a couple of development programs within R&D particularly flu and our line program and see if those
would be better served to be partnered or divested. And we also were open potentially to our two in-line vaccines, to
divesting those as well depending on the preference of the partners.
So we've gone through a process, talked to a lot of different interested parties, and that process is ongoing, so not
appropriate to comment further now. We are very focused on optimizing the value of the overall vaccine portfolio and
as we make progress we'll certainly share that as appropriate. So still working on it but nothing to update at the
moment.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: With respect to the HyQvia panel scheduled for July 31, the team is getting ready for the
interaction, the dialogue. No new questions. It's still the same as we discussed before, or the questions related to
long-term safety of the antibodies related to PH20 and specifically neuronal development and fertility. So nothing new
there. I'm very pleased that you will be able to see all our data. We believe that our data is clean and that we have a
positive benefit/ risk but we will – as you will be there mostly likely, we'll have a great dialogue with the FDA.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Great. Thank you, Ludwig.

<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Hi, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Bigger picture first. You're clearly investing heavily on the BioScience's side pre-spin. Seemingly
on the surface a little less so in Medical Devices although, obviously, Gambro is a big investment that you're
integrating. But so definitely you're actively supplementing Biopharma ahead of the spin. Should we expect that
Medical Product business development opportunities could come before the spin too? Or are you going to focus on that
post-spin?
And maybe just as part of that as long as I'm laying it all out here, it sounds like you're interested in M&A. What areas
are you likely to be thinking about? Something directly related to the existing business or broadening the scope of the
post-spin Med Device company? Thanks.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah. Okay. Rick, thanks for the question. Several things. Yeah, I mean, obviously,
Gambro is the largest acquisition in the history of the company, so that really expresses an investment, I guess, in new
BAX but I think maybe what isn't appreciated as much is in the R&D area. The nature of the investments have been
really in new systems, home hemodialysis, the VIVIA system, which we're really excited about has been a five-year
investment. Likewise, the OMNIA system, which is our next-generation HomeChoice and so on. So those don't jump
out in the way that our Biopharmaceutical investments do, but we have been making meaningful investments in internal
R&D, those being just a couple examples.
Relative to business development activity going forward, we continue to be open to that despite, as you say and we all
know, our primary focus is the spin. Not suggesting we won't do anything but if we do, it'll be of a smaller nature.
Longer-term, look, we think there continue to be opportunities within the two core areas, which are treatment of
end-stage renal disease as well as the hospital channel. With the movement of the BioSurgery business over to the new
Baxter going forward, very few companies can represent the breadth and diversity of products that are sold in the Acute
Care hospital.
And so from an acquisition business development point of view going forward, that will continue to be I think a major
area of focus to further solidify the channel. I'm not sure what percent of all healthcare dollars are either spent or driven
through the Acute Care channel but it's a very high percentage. And as I say, very few companies have as strong of a
presence in platform from a channel perspective there as we do. So I think it's fair to say at a very high level that that
will drive our business development including acquisition efforts going forward.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Rick, I would just point out that I did mention in my prepared comments that in addition
to the SG&A and R&D investments, we are making investments in operations within Medical Products. We're seeing
very strong demand, particularly in the U.S. for IVs and PD and we're seeing the regulatory environment raising the bar
on everything from production through logistics. So there are incremental investments going into that as well.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Right. And just to follow up quickly on Renal. Bob Hombach, as you said, PD gains were very
strong in the quarter, up 15% in the U.S. Is that kind of growth sustainable? Maybe help us understand that and help us
understand a little bit more about the timing issues o-U.S. Do they swing back positive in the second half? It didn't
happen in the second quarter but now they have happened? I'm not sure I fully understood what was going on there.
Thank you.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Rick, I'll comment on what I'll call the market trends and then if Bob wants to add
some color in terms of specifically the financial flow and so on, he can do that. It's fair to say that globally, not just the
U.S. but globally, there is a movement into more treatment in the home. Okay? Whether that's peritoneal dialysis or,
over time, home hemodialysis and you see a number of countries, Thailand being one, Taiwan being another that put –
in the case of Thailand what they call "PD First" which says, look, as we provide access to treatment of end-stage renal
disease, the government policy is going to drive treatment in the home, because there's a general feeling that it's lower
cost. It certainly is greater convenience for patients, and in some cases, and we believe very strongly in terms of home
hemodialysis, we're going to be able to demonstrate advancing clinical outcomes in a meaningful way such as life
expectancy and so on.

But you see the same dynamics going on in the U.S., and so in response to the first part of your question, Rick, yeah, I
think the strength that we're seeing in the U.S. market for PD clearly is going to continue. I think it's driven by kind of a
rebalancing of the reimbursements so now there are economic incentives for the providers to be in PD in ways in the
past there were not. And then of course with our launch, over time, of home hemodialysis I think does further
accelerate the growth. So simply stated, in the U.S., I think the strength you're seeing is not a transient effect. I think it's
a representation of some more longer term, environmental trends and give us confidence that that kind of growth is
sustainable.
Bob, do want to comment maybe more specifically on the numbers part of the question?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, so as it relates to PD patients in the U.S., we've seen a pretty consistent trend over
the last five or six quarters of high single-digit, low double-digit PD patient growth. So that demand is there with the
harmonization around reimbursement. We've certainly seen a very strong move in the U.S. in particular, so I don't think
15%'s necessarily sustainable but certainly high single digit, low double-digit PD patient growth here in the near term is
certainly a possibility.
And o-U.S., given the mix of revenue that we get per patient in different markets, whatever the Renal sales number
we're reporting, you can be assured that the patient growth is probably a little faster for all the reasons that Bob just
mentioned. So we are globally seeing very strong PD patient growth but particularly in the U.S.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: The other thing I would mention again from a macro perspective is that in many
emerging markets and developing markets you have a lot of patients that aren't even being treated today. So it's one of
the reasons we made the investment in Gambro that we did. This is a large market. It's going to continue to grow. By
virtue of the Gambro acquisition, we have established a leadership position in this market, augmented by the exciting
launch of some new products such as VIVIA in the home and I think it's a good bet that we made long-term.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, last thing I'll add, second quarter is somewhat depressed because of a timing of a
tender as we talked about in Q1 related to Renal, so I'd really look at year-to-date sales as being more indicative of the
trend.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah, good point.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Sam, we have time for two more questions.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to check just with respect to the spin-off,
at the time of the announcement you guys had commented that you did not anticipate being able to re-domicile the
BioScience businesses. Is that still the case or have your thoughts changed at all?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: No change. Certainly just as a function of a spin-out, that is not an opportunity to do a tax
re-domiciling so that's not on the radar.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then just on the IG business, can you comment just a little bit about what
you're seeing in terms of the dynamic between price and then the supply in the marketplace? Because it sounds like
price has been a little less favorable than what it has been historically, particularly within the U.S.?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, I would say we've had very modest expectations on price in the U.S. over the last
couple of years and our longer range outlook assumes that as well. So I think that remains largely consistent. We're
looking forward to having enhanced supply here as we go forward. We're able to support market growth here in 2014
and 2015 with our current footprint and we continue to work with Sanguine to bring flexible capacity online, which we
expect in 2015 to be able to provide not only for the U.S. potentially but certainly for Europe and other markets. So
we're pleased with where we're at from a capacity standpoint and the flexibility we're going to have going forward and

again from a price perspective I think largely in line with our expectations.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Ludwig, one question for you just to clarify,
you kind of framed the Eloctate impact as kind of high single-digits in the U.S. I guess just to clarify is that high
single-digit market share in the second half? Or is that averaged over the whole year? Or was that actually in fact a
worldwide impact?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: The single-digit market share impact is for the U.S. and that is between now and the
launch of BAX 855.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Perfect. That's great. And, Bob, one of the things that just looking at the numbers and it's kind
of very insightful observation but when you look at the Renal business it is so heavily ex-U.S. Could you just broadly
speak about the opportunities in the U.S. now that Gambro's part of the fold?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah, well, it's, Bruce, some of this is consistent with my response earlier I think it
was to Rick Wise's question. For the first time over the last year or so largely as a result of reimbursement changes and
so on, we're seeing really a boost to our PD business. We look forward to that being augmented by the home HD
launch. But there's a lot of things that now for the first time in the U.S. are actually driving consideration of treatment
in the home whether that is PD or HD, which is very exciting because frankly the U.S. business for Renal for us has
been pretty lackluster over the last number of years but, as has been demonstrated, I think Bob Hombach cited some of
the growth numbers for PD patients, we're really seeing that business get reenergized and again as I commented in my
response earlier to Rick, we think that's going to be sustainable.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks so much.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yep.
Operator
