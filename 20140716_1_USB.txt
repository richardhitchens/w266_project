Richard K. Davis
Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin our review of U.S. Bank's
results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on page three of the presentation.
U.S. Bancorp reported record income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2014 or $0.78 per diluted common share.
Total average loans grew year-over-year by 6.8% and 2% linked quarter. We experienced strong loan growth and total
average deposits of 6% over the prior year and 1.9% linked quarter. Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs
decreased by 11% from the prior year and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis. Non-performing assets excluding
covered assets declined compared to both the prior-year quarter and on a linked quarter basis.
We continued to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated for Basel III
standardized approach as if fully implemented was 8.9% at June 30. We repurchased 15 million shares of common
stock during the second quarter, which, along with our dividend, resulted in a 75% return of earnings to our
shareholders in the second quarter.
Slide four provides you with a five quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best
in the industry. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.6%, and return on average common equity was
15.1%.
Moving to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.27%, in line with our
guidance. Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 53.1%. Excluding the impact of two notable items in the
second quarter, our efficiency ratio was 51.3%. We expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s going forward as we
continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.
Turning to slide five. The company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $5.2 billion, a 4.9% increase
from the prior year. Excluding the impact of this quarter's Visa sale, total net revenue increased 0.5% from the prior
year. The increase was mainly due to the higher net interest income, as well as increases in a majority of fee revenue
categories, partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking revenue.
Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $15
billion, or 6.8% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, a runoff portfolio, average
total loans grew by 8.3% year-over-year and 2.2% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding
was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 12.4% year-over-year and 5.9% over the
prior quarter.
Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters with average growing loans growing by
6.9% year-over-year and 1.1% linked quarter. Residential real estate loans grew 10.5% year-over-year and 0.4% over
the prior quarter. Average credit card loans increased 5.9% year-over-year and were flat on a linked quarter basis.
Within the other retail loan categories, auto loans and leases were higher both year-over-year and linked quarter while
average home-equity lines and loans continued to decline. The rate of decline in this category, however, has slowed
considerably over the past few quarters.
Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow in a fast pace,
increasing year-over-year by 12.7% and 3.1% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization increased slightly and was
approximately 24% in the second quarter. Total average deposits increased $15 billion, or 6%, over the same quarter of
last year. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits increased by 1.9% with growth in low cost savings deposits
particularly strong on a linked quarter basis.
Turning to slide seven and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 11% on a year-over-year basis and rose
modestly on a linked quarter basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.58% in the second
quarter. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by 1.6% on a linked quarter basis and 8.1% from
the second quarter of 2013.

During the second quarter we released $25 million of reserves, $10 million less than in the first quarter of 2014 and $5
million less than in the second quarter of 2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net
charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the third quarter 2014.
Andy will now give you a few more details about our second quarter results.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Richard.
Slide eight gives you a view of our second quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of
$0.78 was two cents higher than the second quarter 2013 and $0.05 cents higher than the previous quarter. The key
drivers of the company's second-quarter earnings are summarized on slide nine.
Second quarter results included two previously disclosed notable items. The company reached a $200 million
settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice met to resolve their investigation into the endorsement of mortgage
loans under the FHA's insurance program. Also in the quarter, and prior to the settlement, the company sold three
million shares of class B common stock of Visa resulting in a pre-tax gain of $214 million. Combined, these notable
items had no impact to diluted earnings per common share for the second quarter. Excluding these notable items, the
company achieved positive operating leverage both on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis.
The $11 million or 0.7% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue
and a lower provision for credit losses. Net interest income was up 2.7% year-over-year as an increase in average
earning assets was partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin. The $24 billion growth in average earning
assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio.
Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $4 billion reduction in average loans held for sale,
reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year.
The net interest margin of 3.27% was 16 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in
the investment portfolio and lower average rates and lower rates on new loans, partially offset by lower rates on
deposits and short-term borrowings and a reduction in higher cost long-term debt.
Non-interest income increased $168 million or 7.4% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in other income due to
the Visa sale. Including the Visa sale, increases in the majority of fee revenue categories partially offset the decline in
mortgage banking revenue. We saw a growth in retail and corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and
investment management fees, deposit service charges, commercial product revenues and investment products fees.
Non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $196 million or 7.7% due to the FHA DOJ settlement. Excluding this
settlement, non-interest expense was essentially flat as lower employee benefits expense driven by lower pension costs
was offset by higher compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and
compliance activities.
Net income on a linked-quarter basis was $98 million, or 7% higher, mainly due to an increase in total net revenue. On
a linked-quarter basis, net interest income increased due to higher average earning assets and an additional day in the
quarter, partially offset by lower loan rates. The net interest margin of 3.27% was eight basis points lower than the first
quarter, principally due to the growth in lower rate investment securities and lower rates on new loans mainly due to
higher growth in wholesale as compared to retail loans.
On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $336 million, or 15.9%. This favorable variance was
primarily due to the Visa sale, seasonally higher payments revenue and growth in all other fee categories. Higher
mortgage banking revenue was principally due to a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net
of hedging activities.
On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest expense increased by $209 million, or 8.2%, due to the FHA DOJ settlement.
Excluding the settlement, non-interest expense was essentially flat. Lower employee benefits expense was offset by

higher professional services and marketing and business development expense.
Turning to slide 10, our capital position is strong. Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements
effective for the company follow Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years
to full implementation by January 1 of 2018. Basel III includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating
risk-weighted assets: a general, standardized approach; and a more risk sensitive advanced approaches.
As of April 1, 2014, the company exited its parallel run qualification period, resulting in this capital adequacy now
being evaluated against whichever Basel III methodology is most restrictive. The most restrictive methodology for our
company is currently the standardized approach. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III
standardized approach as if fully implemented at Jun 30 was 8.9%. At 8.9%, we are well above the 7% Basel III
minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.26 at June 30, representing a 13.2% increase over
the same quarter of last year and a 1.8% increase over the prior quarter.
Turning to slide 11. In June, the Board of Directors declared a 6.5% increase in our common stock dividend. As a result
in the second quarter we returned 75% of our earnings to shareholders. Dividends accounted for 31% of the return to
shareholders and the 15 million shares of stock we repurchased in the second quarter accounted for the remaining 44%.
I will now turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Andy.
To conclude our final remarks I'll turn your attention to slide 12. Again, in the second quarter, we focused on extending
our advantage, which is our theme for 2014. Our advantage is real, and it extends to every one of our businesses. Our
prudent risk management, our efficient operating platform, and our industry-leading profitability allow us to operate
from this position of strength.
The Chicago-area Charter One Bank franchise acquisition that we completed in late June is just one example of that
strength.
As we move through the second half of 2014, we'll continue to look to extend our advantage. Our 67,000 talented and
engaged employees remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable, and repeatable results for the benefit of our
customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: My first question is the outlook on commercial loan growth for the rest of the year.
Obviously your gains on an organic basis continued to be quite impressive, and the commentary from the large banks
that have reported before you has been quite positive for the year. And I was wondering, Richard, if you could add your
commentary in terms of what you're hearing from customers in terms of CapEx for the next six months.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'd be happy to, Erika. Thank you. First of all, you're right, we've had some remarkably
consistent and industry-leading growth in average loans and with the commercial, kind of the wholesale banking being

up 5.9% linked quarter, that would be one of our best quarters we've seen in a long time.
I'll first tell you that we're seeing it particularly in the middle market, where we really want to see the core growth in
the country as we see middle market businesses starting to expand on a more organic basis. Credit structures are
firming up at the expense of pricing. I typically tell you we don't lose on pricing, and we don't, because we have a cost
advantage, but we do see a pricing compression both in the middle market and the leveraged space. But particularly I
see that as a good sign of some form of green shoots and growth.
In the larger and investment grade credit, structures and pricing remain much more stable. But they're also more event
driven than they might be organic driven.
Loan demands for second quarter were particularly high and in the second quarter we expect it to moderate slightly but
still be at a substantially higher growth rate. In other words, the 5.9% will probably moderate to something more
between 3% to 5% as we look into the next quarter.
And our long growth is strong across the country. There's no regional definition. Retail food and ag continue to be
strong, we see some weaknesses coming in oil, gas, energy and utility. So it's probably where you'd expect it to be and
our reflection of loan growth, and our forecast I think is in line with what you see and read about in the current
economy.
Finally, we're seeing new credit opportunities being driven by refinancing, but also seeing, as I said earlier, organic
growth. What's interesting is people are starting to increase inventory, we think, to build for a better economy and a
better outlook in quarters three and four. I've long believed that as the Fed starts to get closer to what is a reality of
increased rates and at least the belief that they're imminent, that that starts to increase economic activity on the
wholesale side as people prepare for a better economy.
We also expect increased M&A activity to continue. And finally, we see companies looking to banks to create
alternative avenues of funding if they want to prove to the rating agencies that have a diversified source of funding. So
I think banks might be back in favor again for reasons that make sense, but especially as rates continue to be low,
people don't want to miss that window before it closes.
So in total, I'll answer even more than you asked, we are at the 2% linked quarter loan growth. We offer you guys kind
of a range of one to 1% to 1.5% and then we move around that as the quarter seasons. We're going to bring it back
down to that 1.5% as a starting point as the quarter three begins and we'll start to iterate that as we get further into the
quarter, but I think the 2% might be a high quarter for us this year, but we're still expecting to be substantially
impressive and somewhere between the 1.5% range as we get further along into quarter three.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Thank you for that. And just again, I wanted ask about another area of strength. The
year-over-year gains in card balances certainly outperformed, even on a core basis, your larger competitors. And I'm
wondering if you could give us a sense of how that correlates with sales volume versus actual balance growth and how
much is this taking wallet share away from the larger competitors?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Erika, this is Andy. I would say it's a combination of all those things. It's market share
growth as well as core customer growth. So same-store activity, same-store sales on both the merchant and card side
was up about 4.5%, a little stronger in Europe than in North America, but in North America, right around 4%. And if
you look at our card fees, both on the linked quarter and year-over-year basis, it's reflective of the increase in
same-store sales and the customer spend. And then if you look at balances, balances were relatively flat on a linked
quarter basis. Part of that is seasonality, but you see that growth year-over-year. The level of spend continues to
increase. The level of utilization, so to speak, is flat to down a little bit.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And just one last question for you, Andy. I was wondering if you could give us an
update on where you are with regards to potential or LCR compliance with the proposals, and also how much further
pressure we should expect on the margin as we think about maybe potentially building the securities book further out
for HQLA?

Page 6 of 14
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure, Erica. So in terms, first of all, in LCR we are very close to that number. As you know,
we ended this quarter at $90 billion in securities. We will plan to grow to $95 billion in the third quarter, so up $5
billion more, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. And once we get to the end of the third quarter, I'll let you
know, but we're going to be very, very close as our expectations, the final rule will come out here in the next few
months, and that will guide us to what our final number is, but we're very close.
In terms of margin, our margin was down eight basis points in the quarter this second quarter, and there are three
components. The first is the securities build I just spoke to, which cost us about three basis points. The second was the
reduction in CAA, checking account advance fees, which runs through loan fees, and we've talked about that. That cost
us about two basis points. And then finally, the loan mix, most of the growth that occurred this quarter was in the
wholesale category. In fact, wholesale overall was up about 4% and retail was relatively flat. Wholesale is a little lower
yield, and that cost us about three basis points. So that is the eight basis points in quarter two.
As we look into quarter three, I would expect the same securities impact, about three basis points. I would expect a
similar loan mix impact of two to three basis points, and CAA in quarter three will cause a reduction of about five basis
points in margin, because our $39 million will go to effectively zero. So you add all that up it's 10 to 11 basis points.
But importantly, net interest income will still grow in quarter three versus quarter two.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: This is Richard. Importantly, after that CAA $39 million going to zero, we are done. So that
impact is over. And as Andy said at this call 90 days from today, we'll hopefully have both the rules and know where
our final liquidity build is so we can either call it done or call it near done and give you final guidance. But for that, all
that leaves is the mix, and we're all hopeful that we'll continue to do well on commercial and that the consumer will
start to bid its own place in growth. In that case the margins will firm up. So we'll telegraph to you all once those two
activities of CAA and liquidity build are over, we think the margin flattens out and is very small movement along with
the vagaries of the mix.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Thank you for such complete answers. I appreciate it.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: You're welcome.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thanks. Good morning. As we look ahead to the period where the Fed – I guess excess reserves
decreases, the Fed drains liquidity from the system, could you talk a little bit about presumably in that kind of
environment the strong deposit growth that you've been enjoying decreases? And perhaps maybe if you could
comment, give some color on the pecking order of your funding preferences as we look forward to a stronger loan
growth environment? And perhaps comment on whether you see banks having to – some banks having to raise more
expensive funding to remain LCR compliant?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, Bill, I would say our focus has been on the core deposit category. You've seen good
growth in that category across DVA as well as across interest-bearing deposits, and it's across the retail as well as the
wholesale and corporate trust side of the equation. We have a great funding source in our corporate trust business,
which represents about 15% of our deposit base including our DVA balances. So we have strong core deposits and
strong opportunity for continued growth, and that would be our principal preference in terms of growth as we look at
increased rates.
So secondarily, we have ample access to the wholesale markets in terms of debt issuance, and as you know, we have
one of the lowest spreads out there in terms of our opportunity there. So that would be secondary, though, to deposit
growth.
Finally, we have an entity called the Money Center, which is a short-term balance sheet growth in terms of deposits for
wholesale customers, which offers us another opportunity of wholesale growth. So those are our sort of order of

opportunity.
I will also tell you that we are positively biased to increasing rates as you see from our Q and our disclosures, 1.75% or
so in terms of a 200 basis points parallel shift. And in addition, we have about $100 million in waivers that will come
through in fee income to the extent rates go up 75 or 100 basis points.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: That's very helpful. Thank you, Andy. And I had one last one for Richard. Richard, can you offer
some perspective on – you gave some very helpful color in your commentary, but perhaps anything that you're seeing
now that gives you greater confidence in the sustainability of the recovery given some of the head fakes that we've seen
to date?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I will, Bill. This is more of the Richard Davis view of the world, just so you know, and it's
consistent, but I've always thought that in this recession as we finally come out of it that it's going to be the businesses
that blink first. In other words, it's not consumer-driven like it has been many times past, because the wealth effect still
isn't present given the housing values and some of the skittish nature of consumers having gone through this recession.
So I'm seeing more and more that consumerism will be incentivized by price lowering, and by new activities and new
product innovation by the wholesale side. And we're seeing that. That's why I kind of don't mind – I don't like the mix
version, but I like wholesale growing. It makes sense to me that it's growing faster and first in this recession recovery
than the consumer.
That also aligns with what I think we would all agree that under Janet Yellen we're seeing more and more, while she
will talk about how careful she wants to be about increasing rates, we're taking away some of the time specificity that
used to be there. We're not linking it to unemployment rates, we're not linking it to points in time, but we are linking it
to a sense of, how much longer can rates be low and what kind of levers would it give the Fed to start moving rates up.
I think there's enough sentiment in our customer's view that that is coming to an end, and that does encourage and
incentivize people to take action and make some decisions that they've been sitting on for many, many years. Those are
both sustainable kind of actions that will provide us with the next generation of slow but steady growth back into the
consumers and we're looking for. And so businesses lead-out based on a belief that things are coming to an end on low
rates. Consumers follow, then we're back into maybe a different kind of recovery, but one that we will all welcome
greatly.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: That's great. Thanks very much, gentleman. I really appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Hi. Good morning, guys. It's actually Bryan from Ken's team.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Bryan.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Hi. My first question is on expenses. Ex the DOJ charge, they were pretty flat
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So just wondering what the outlook is for costs in the back half of the year,
and if there's an expectation that you'll continue to drive positive operating leverage?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes we do expect positive operating leverage. If you back-out the two notable items this
quarter, as Richard mentioned in his comments, we did have positive operating leverage both on the linked quarter as
well as year-over-year basis. We would expect to have that for the full year, and we would expect to have our
efficiency ratio continue to be in the low 50s, just like what you saw this quarter.

<Q - Bryan Batory>: Okay. Great. And then next, on the discontinuation of the deposit advance product, I think
previously you guys had stated that there's not a ton of offsets either with new lending products or fee-based products
that you can offer. Just wanted to get your updated thoughts there. Is there anything you're looking at today that could
offset some of that revenue give-up in the net interest income?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, Bryan, I don't see it, not in this category. We're going to be looking more into mobile
banking, some of the new innovative deposit products to offset that category. To the extent that we would have to live
within some of the new rules that have been created for that kind of product, it would almost be a break even product,
and we may still well come out with something, because we want to continue to be good stewards of helping people,
first-time customers, and help people that have certainly less means than the average. But at the same time, it's not
going be a moneymaker. So I wouldn't consider it a replacement for any kind of a fee category.
I will say that U.S. Bank is working on and we'll probably have a product that will be sufficient to meet a different set
of customer needs that we were meeting before. But I think we'll start turning our attention more to things like mobile
banking and mobile payments in some of our payment categories to replace what will be kind of a forever lost income
benefit from that original Checking Account Advance. So we'll seek it. It will take longer to replace than it would have
been just a straight-up product, but I wouldn't count on it.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Okay. And the tax rate jumped up a bit. Was there anything unusual there? And is the outlook
still for 20% going forward?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, nothing unusual. 28% to 29% for the full year.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Bryan.

Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Just a follow up on the expense question, Richard or Andy. Where are we in terms of the
expense environment for U.S. Bank? I know that periodically you have the plan B, which is a more strict approach
based on the revenue environment, but just out of curiosity, what is the message internally on expenses?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, thank you, Jon. Look, we are on plan B right now. There's plan C and D, by the way,
but we're on plan B. Our employees have been really – they trust us, and I appreciate that a lot. In other words, we've
said to them, look, the plan that we expected last November when we built 2014 was revenue up X and expenses up
slightly less than X. And as you well know, I think quarter one was a loss quarter. We're not going to that made up, and
so we've asked everybody to reduce their expense growth, still to grow but at a lower level as we expect revenue to
grow but at a lower level.
We're in the middle of that now, and what that just means is, we're not taking any risk with discretionary expenses.
We're not out – we're asking people to watch their nickels and dimes and to keep a close eye on FTE. That's not
sustainable, but we also don't think it's going to need to be. But we'll continue to employ it until the economy starts to
show a little more robust sustainability.
Having said that, I think we've mentioned before the key elements of expense growth are pretty much already in place
at the company. A, our CapEx, which is always a big number, we've used the last two years to really catch up from the
many years before that, and we've hit our peak years behind us, but we have the amortized costs that will continue to
feather through the next few, but we've hit our peak and that starts to move down over the coming years. We don't see

any kind of a retrace back to a high level.
We've got the compensation and the FTE, but for these acquisitions and new partners we're bringing on, we've got a
really nice steady-state. Our compensation is at parity with our peers. Our performance plans pay people for
performance. We've been paying above target for the last few years because we've performed at that level. So there's
not a big issue there.
And then finally on general operating costs, we have one operating system. We've always had one operating system.
When we bring in a company, we bring it to the same singular view of operating integrity, so we don't have multiple
accounting firms, accounting systems, and multiple technology systems that we have to integrate.
So on one hand, I told you what you all tell me, which is that you guys don't have much upside in reducing your
expenses because you're already efficient. And I'll say that's true, and you're welcome. We work hard at that and we
protect it and I think by staying in the low 50s, as we've committed, it's a good indicator to you that we will let revenue
be the driver to expenses. But there's nothing substantial that we're holding back on or wish we had the opportunity to
spend money on. It's pretty much at the run rate.
The last big dog is this hunt is whether or not compliance costs are fully burdened. I'm not going be dumb enough to
say I think that we're done, but I believe that based on everything I'm looking at, we've come to a place where our
operating expenses aligned with compliance, audit and operating integrity is pretty much where it needs to be for a
while, separate some surprise, and that we've, I think, put in place for the last couple of quarters, so I don't see a big
jump.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a question for Bill Parker just on credit. I know it's really kind of
a non-issue at this point but...
<A - Richard K. Davis>: What? You want to talk about credit? Gee, that's so 2010.
<A - P. W. Parker>: I'm here. [Laughter]
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: That's part of this. I remember when you broke through 100 basis points of charge-offs, and
that seemed like a big thing and you talked about maybe being a 90 to 100 basis point charge-off bank. Now it seems
like we're bouncing around 60. Is this is the trough, Bill? Does this feel like normal where it's going to bounce around?
Or what are the puts and takes in terms of the loss outlook?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Well, in terms of the environment we're in, which is a stable economy, a modestly improving
economy, yeah, our outlook for our losses are currently stable. The one area we still have some room for improvement
and based on the decline in delinquencies that we saw this quarter would be in residential mortgage, so there's still
room for improvement there. But for this type of environment, that 90 to 100 that you mentioned, we refine that every
quarter. Right now, it's 96. But that's a through the cycle measure. It looks at the good times and the bad times.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: That's probably a long way off.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, so right now where we're at is a comfortable spot for this type of environment.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. And, Bill, anything making you nervous or anything where you're holding the line and
saying, no, we're not going to do that?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Well, I wouldn't be doing my job if there weren't some of those, but in general, we have not
materially changed any of our underwriting standards. The only thing we did coming out of the downturn was do some
controlled expansion on our indirect auto portfolio. That's gone well. We've had strong originations in that space, but
it's all very high credit quality.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Dan Werner with Morningstar.
<Q - Dan Werner>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess relative to – with credit quality kind of
expanding on that, with commercial loan growing and kind of driving the growth here and stable credit quality, you're
still releasing reserves here. Should we expect that to continue or reverse going forward as loans continue to grow here?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Well, someday, yes, and I can't tell you the exact inflection point, but our reserve release this
quarter was $25 million so very, very modest, about a penny a share. So whether we release a little or start adding a
little, depending upon the strength of loan and commitment growth, I'd say it's not that relevant to the earnings potential
going forward. But we watch that. We still have a little bit of credit improvement to go, and so we watch that and
balance that with our loan and commitment growth.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And, Dan, it will be a super easily telegraphed, very soft turn of the quarter when that
happens, and the inflection. So you won't be surprised by one quarter over the next. This is a very slow process. And
eventually, I would love to be adding to loan losses, because the loan growth is so robust and because we should
prepare for years forward. So that to me at the end of the day won't be a bad outcome, but we're not there yet.
<Q - Dan Werner>: Okay. And then a second question on mortgage revenue, I had in my notes to expect right
between $225 million and $250 million in revenue. Is that still consistent? Or relatively is that the range that we're
going to for the rest of the year?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes. I think that's in the range. So as you look into the third quarter versus the second
quarter, this is Andy, we would expect mortgage application volume to increase slightly, typical seasonal increases but
the servicing revenue will come down a bit. So I would expect it to be flat to down a bit from this quarter.
<Q - Dan Werner>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Dan.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Thank you. Good morning. Could you just touch on the fee momentum? It looked like you
had pretty broad momentum in fee categories this quarter. You obviously just touched on the mortgage outlook, but
could you just give a sense of which line items or which categories, ex-seasonality in 2Q, you feel like there's good
underlying momentum that could carry through in the back half of 2014?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure. This is Andy again. So across our Payments businesses we saw growth in all four
categories. I would say most of the government pressure that we had seen in corporate card is behind us. In fact,
government actually grew this quarter as well as corporate. So corporate fees are good, merchant processing fees
continue to grow, card fees continue to grow. Our trusts and investment management is doing very well, both on the
wealth management side as well as the corporate trust side. Commercial product fees, which is a reflection of corporate
and wholesale activity continues to grow. Investment management is growing. So we're actually seeing growth across
many categories of our fees, including deposit service charge, which is more seasonal and based on days, but really I
wouldn't say there are any particular weakness and strong growth across all. And I think all of them are quite leveraged
to an economic recovery. So to the extent the growth accelerates, I think we'll see even accelerated fee growth.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And I would add to that, Keith. With interest rates and FX volatility so low, that's the area
where that volume continues to be under some pressure. But as Andy said, it's very positively indexed toward an
improving economy. Derivative backlog is good, corporate bond fees are on track. So we're seeing some of those

coming back to some level that make sense as the economy starts to warm up a bit. But that would be the laggards as
we go through the list of key businesses that we watch.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Thank you. Maybe one for Bill. Can you give an update on the SNC review? Was any of that
in this quarter? I'm assuming it's going to be in the third quarter for you guys, but just any thoughts on the process this
year versus past, et cetera?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yes. I'm glad you asked that, actually, because...
<A - Richard K. Davis>: His eyes lit up when you asked it.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, usually we do get the results in August, but this year we got them early. So we have
processed everything. It's in our results. Any changes for us were completely immaterial. We had excellent results. We
have not seen sort of the OCC's or the regulator's industry publication, which gives some insight into where they saw
stress on really just speaking for our portfolio, but we are in and done with it, and no material impact.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Okay. Thanks. And then last one, looked like GAAP assets were up about 10%
year-over-year. The Basel III risk-weighted assets were up around 7%. Is this just a mix thing, meaning more securities,
highly rated securities? Or is there any kind of optimization going on that you guys are focused on?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: It's exactly what you said. It's the securities growth at a lower risk-weighted asset.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Brian.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Hi. So on the loan growth, I guess clearly you guys are doing very well. I guess one of the
things I scratch my head on is when I benchmark you to the large domestic banks in the H.8, or the what's come out so
far in the quarter, clearly the 6.7% year-over-year growth ex-Charter One is best in class. But then when I benchmark
you to the kind of headline numbers for the system, it's about in line. And it seems like the disconnect, A, clearly there's
the small bank trend, which you've talked about in the past, and I was hoping you could update us where you see that
level of competition? But then b, there's this kind of new trend of foreign banks really growing quite rapidly, at least in
the total system data, and I was wondering if you could also offer any thoughts you have there, if that's something that
is material and you're seeing in your markets, or is that more happening in the capital markets and leveraged lending
and not really affecting you?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes. Sure. This is Richard. So first of all, I guess I think of four categories. I think of the
GSIFI kind of domestic banks. I think of the regional banks like us. I think of community banks, and I think of the
foreign banks. In our intelligence, neither the community banks nor the foreign banks are taking any market share or
creating any impairment to our growth. So I can't really look at all the data that you're looking at. On the H.8, we
typically are about half to twice better than those averages as we track it ourselves. So it's consistent with what we're
seeing.
Community banks are not as diversified, so they'll go down the path on one or two loan product types and will fight a
good fight in certain smaller markets but at the end of the day when you're looking for a customer with a need for more
than just one loan or one type of loan, we typically win the day on that. And the foreign banks, maybe it's because we're
more centrally located in the middle of the country and even to the West Coast, but they're simply not creating a burden
to us that we've noticed at this point and they have in the past, so both of those categories have harmed us in the times

before.
I think I'll take you back through to the long-standing rationale that we've used to take it outside of the, "Gee, I wonder
what they're doing?" to "Oh, that makes sense" category. And that is, our funding advantages are just substantial. I
mean, they're just real. They're very real and they're very big. And you compare to any of those other three groups from
the large money center banks to the community banks to the foreign banks, we beat them every time.
So but for this management team getting greedy or sloppy and letting too much of that benefit go away altogether,
we're letting it dole itself out into higher pricing benefits to the highest quality customers, which is why can we can
have high-quality, have growth and have it on the low risk side and use some of that advantage.
So hopefully that makes sense as to why we're doing it. There's no magic here and there's no sustainability risk of this
going away unless we were to harm our own ratings, and we're not planning to do that either. So hopefully, Brian, that
gives you little more color.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: That does. Thank you. All my other questions have been asked. Thanks.

Our final question comes from line of Nancy Bush with NAB research.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Nancy. Or not.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: ...express a little bit of concern about the behavior of consumer deposits as rates rise. I
wonder if you've given much thought to the issue, if you guys are testing, if you see the need for any new or different
products this time around or if you expect things to be pretty sticky.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Nancy, this is Andy. I do think we're going to see a decline in deposits overall, more than
what we've seen historically when rates start to move up. And we've actually modeled that in our rate sensitivity when
we gave you our numbers. The best example I think is our DVA levels have gone from about $50 billion to almost $74
billion, and I do expect because there's low opportunity costs of that DVA today, as rates move up, we're going to see
some decline there. So we are modeling it that way. We are preparing for it that way, and we also have a number of
consumer products that we're testing in different markets in terms of a little higher rate to continue to grow core
deposits.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'll add to that, Nancy. I should hope deposits start to fall because that would be a great
indicator that people are using their cash. As you know, then they'll use the line they've been paying for and then they'll
get a new line.
That brings me to utilization a little bit. We're seeing utilization continue to be slowly but surely getting better, slowly
is the operative. We're not seeing a huge turn, but actually, this last quarter was the first increase in our wholesale
utilization since 2008. Small as it might be, that's a pretty big dern deal and that's along with the potential of deposits
starting to come out. Those would actually be good signs, I think, of consumers and businesses using their money and
then some of our money to kind of fund their growth.
But I will say, we also have this advantage that we want to remind people of on the core deposit side with our corporate
trust business, which has a fair amount of contractual difference and distinction. Fifteen percent or so of our
non-interest-bearing comes from that safer category and no matter what the stress test that we provide will result in, it
allows us with a little bit more of a foundation core for deposits that advantages us again with this corporate trust
business that we don't talk enough about but provides a distinction and a uniqueness to our portfolio.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Thanks for playing that out. Richard, your thoughts about the payments businesses right
now? Are you seeing any opportunities? Are you more or less excited as you see better economic activity to add to the
payments portfolio?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I am really loving it. I'm glad we have it. One of the things I've often said to you,
Nancy, directly, and to others is if you like us now, you're going to love us all when things get better.
One of things that we haven't talked much about is the R&D that we've been spending on payments, mobile payments,
not banking so much as payments, which is a space we should be leading in. And there are so many derivatives of what
possibly could happen next as people want to pay for things and track things and move things. And we're in just about
every single prototype we can think of, testing all kinds of different programs, and I'll look forward to the chance to
showcase some of those outcomes.
It's our style not to talk about the things we're piloting because I want to try to them first and why would I telegraph
that to others? And if they don't work, then you'll never know, and if they do, we'll brag about them endlessly.
But I think payments is going to be that next step and I think in my response to the question that Bill or Brian asked I
think it's going to be the replacement fee opportunity for banks as we get to more core checking costs and start getting
paid for helping people see, track and move their money more naturally and more quickly in this environment. So I like
payments for that reason and I like our diversified.
Andy told you government has turned the corner, at least stopped shrinking. Corporate is getting as strong as some of
these other green shoots we've seen in P&I and the consumer, based on credit volume year-over-year was up 9%, debit
was 5%, and prepaid, which is our favorite new space which we have cradle to grave is up 22%.
So for us, payments is a good place to be and like the balance sheet, if you like it now, you're going to love it later, but I
think it's entirely indexed favorably toward an increasing economy. So we'll cross our fingers.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: I have to throw in one thing, Richard. I haven't heard the word, 'dern,' since the last
Hopalong Cassidy movie I watched.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: [Laughter] I haven't seen one lately. And I can't tell you it came from L.A., so I'm not sure
where it came from, either. I think that goes back to Bill. Bill would use that word.
