Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and welcome to the call.
As I look at our first quarter results, I would sum it up by saying that I'm not satisfied with our performance, but I am
encouraged by our progress. It's clear that our financials are not where they need to be, particularly as it relates to
top-line. Yet, we are making progress in strengthening the underpinnings of the Avon business. The internal
improvements we are making aren't yet reflected in our financial performance. However, I remain confident that we are
making the right decisions for Avon's long-term health. I'm encouraged to see that in many of our key markets, we are
making significant improvements in our core processes and talent capabilities. We're getting cost out of the business,
and we are managing through macroeconomic challenges. Most importantly, we are staying the course on our
turnaround plans.
We are looking at the financial health of the company holistically and remain committed to improving top-line, bottom
line and cash to ensure a sustainable recovery. All things considered, we are about where we expected to be entering
the first half of the year. As we've discussed with you before, we expected the first half of 2014 to be challenging based
on how we exited 2013 and the tougher comparison in the first half. But it's fair to say that we also faced more
significant macro headwinds than expected, including foreign exchange fluctuations. However, I'm pleased to say that
the organization is stronger and more responsive than in the past. We have good teams in place, and I'm confident we
will continue to make progress on Avon's turnaround.
Relating to our FCPA matter, as you saw this morning, we have reached agreement on terms of settlement with the
Department of Justice and the staff of the SEC. Pending finalization and required approval, the terms of the settlement
will include: total payments of $135 million; a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice; a
compliance monitor for 18 months; and, subject to government approval, self-monitoring and reporting for 18 months
thereafter, a guilty plea in connection with books and records by a subsidiary operating in China. You can find more
details in this morning's press release and 10-Q. The team has been working very hard to bring this matter to close, and
I'm pleased with the progress they have made.
Now, turning to the overall state of the business, we continue to work on our operational issues. On cost management,
we are making good progress. We are getting cost out of the business, and you see that particularly in the North
American results. We are cutting costs in a strategic manner to both lower our overall spend and free-up resources to
invest in growth. We are assessing all spend to ensure that it has a good return on investments, and we are putting the
right processes in place to ensure that costs doesn't creep back into the system.
On the top-line, the local teams are making progress in stabilizing their businesses. However, our revenue is not yet
where it needs to be. But we see good potential for growth, both organic and incremental, in many of our top markets.
As it relates to our core direct sales business, growth comes from a simple formula: we need more representatives
selling more products. To do that, they need great products and an attractive earnings opportunity. And we'll achieve
this by executing growth plans in a thoughtful, deliberate manner at the market level, consistent with the priorities we
laid out for you at CAGNY in February.
Looking at the business from a regional perspective, in Latin America, the business performed well in the first quarter,
and we are feeling good about the progress there. Our top Latin American markets are each at different stages in the
turnaround. This runs the gamut from Brazil, where we are focused on solid profitable growth, to Mexico where the
team is recovering from some earlier execution issues and is now working to regain momentum, to Venezuela where
we continue to see a very difficult operational environment. I recently had the opportunity to spend time in Argentina
and Chile meeting with the field. I spent time with economists, spent some time with our representatives and also with
associates. And while there's uncertainty as it relates to the macroeconomic issues in Argentina, what I was extremely
pleased to see is that the team is very focused on building our beauty brand, looking at how they simplify, and evolve
the direct selling model and really prepare for that uncertainty.
I'm particularly pleased with the new product execution in Latin America. Our product launches are more strategic,
with a focus on brand building. The Latin American team is sharing and learning from best practices and a good
example of this is the launch of our upper-mass body care line, Encanto. Encanto is extremely successful in Brazil and
it is now being rolled out throughout the region. We have also harmonized our approach to holidays and gifting across

the region, including an exciting Mother's Day plan. So, we've seen great execution from the marketing and sales teams
across the region. Our Latin American teams have also been focused on driving efficiency to free-up resources for
growth. In this vein, we are in the process of exiting Bolivia.
Now, looking at our business in EMEA, one of our key concerns is the current economic environment in Eastern
Europe. We have seen a softening of consumer spend in Russia beginning in late 2013, something I observed when I
was in Russia earlier this year. Consumer spending patterns have been further impacted by the political situation
between Russia and Ukraine. We are supporting our teams in Eastern Europe as they navigate these challenges and
work to engage both consumers and the field. Across the rest of EMEA, the teams continue to make good progress
against their plans.
On my recent visit to the UK, I had the opportunity to spend time with the management team there as well as many
associates. It's very clear that we have seasoned leaders very, very focused on field health, and it resonates through the
entire organization as they focus on Avon values and staying true to the representative. Overall in EMEA and Latin
America, we've progressed to the point that the business is on solid footing in most markets. Clearly, the first quarter
was tough for EMEA, and we have work to do to improve performance. But generally, I feel good about these two
regions and believe they are giving us a good base to work from.
Looking at North America, there's a lot of work to be done this year to get the business back to profitability in 2015,
and I'm pleased with the progress the team is making. The cost cutting we did in the back half of 2013 is pulling
through, which has been helpful as we work to stabilize the business. Let me give you a sense of where we are on some
of the areas we discussed at CAGNY. As a reminder, in North America, we're focused on fixing the field, improving
our store and driving operational excellence. In the field, our focus is on recruiting and retention. We are taking a
segmented approach and focusing resources on the high-potential districts.
We also developed new recruitment kits that have had a very positive reception, particularly from our sales leaders who
do the bulk of the recruiting. They love getting products. And as you know, direct sales is a word-of-mouth business,
and providing product in the kit allows them to try it, love it and recommend it to a friend. The development of the new
recruiting kit is a good example of the team putting the representative at the center and really understanding what she
needs to succeed. We need to do this across all touch points.
On improving the store or our brochure, our marketing team has put significant effort into improving our brochure,
including the creative process. We are also improving the product portfolio and the pricing approach. These
improvements will be executed throughout the year. And at the same time, we are making good progress on our
e-commerce strategy. The third area of focus in North America is driving operational excellence or building better,
leaner processes. Our first round of work on this in late 2013 was focused mainly on cost reduction. We are now
working to make some essential process changes that will further reduce costs, while improving productivity. And you
will see more of this later this year.
And finally, Asia-Pacific; the region has a new management team with a good balance of Avon veterans and external
talent. I was in the Philippines earlier this year and witnessed the strength of that team and was really impressed with
the work that they are doing to improve their overall performance. As I said before, Asia-Pacific is a small portion of
our business, but should be a bigger contributor to Avon's overall performance. We see this region as a source of
longer-term growth. However, our initial focus is on simplifying and stabilizing the existing business. Nilesh Patel, our
new Head of Asia-Pacific, has visited all the key markets in his region and is working on the plan to build for the
future.
As we discussed at CAGNY, we are focused on two core areas in our business: field management and commercial
marketing. Our key markets are making progress on strengthening both processes and people in these areas. I'm really
pleased to see an increased degree of accountability from our local market teams and over time this will lead to more
consistent financial performance. While we continue to make progress on strengthening these core processes, I'm
feeling good about our innovation pipeline, and some of the products will be rolling out over the course of the year.

In the fragrance category, there are two product launches I'd like to note for you. The first is Femme, which was
launched in EMEA on International Women's Day in March. Femme reflects our commitment to improve Avon equity
in fragrance by upgrading the quality of both the packaging and the [ph] juice (11:24). Femme was our most successful
women's fragrance launch in EMEA since 2010, and did really well in Eastern and Central Europe. Femme launched
earlier this quarter in North America and will roll out in other markets over the course of the year. Also in fragrance,
Far Away is Avon's number one fragrance line globally. And as a special 20-year anniversary celebration, we are
launching Far Away Gold. This also has improved packaging and [ph] juice (11:52) and will include a refresh [ph]
accretive (11:55) for the entire Far Away line. Far Away Gold is scheduled for a Mother's Day launch in Latin
America, followed by other markets throughout the year.
In colors, we're continuing the rollout of our Mega Effects Mascara. Mega Effects launched in the second quarter of
2013 with strong results, particularly in EMEA. Our initial launch in North America had mixed results, but we put it
back on the brochure cover in the first quarter with better field support and it's now performing well. Mega Effects also
recently launched at a premium price in Latin America, with very strong early trends on sales.
In skincare, we expect that the latest ANEW innovation, ANEW Clinical Infinite Lift will perform well. This product
combines the patent-pending PolyPeptide Lift Complex technology with a unique, massaging roller applicator. Infinite
Lift launched in the first quarter in North America with favorable results, particularly as we measure it in dollars sold
per representative. We're also giving ANEW Reversalist, one of our most successful skincare lines, a major platform
upgrade and re-stage. This includes a new formulation of our proprietary formula and will be launched with a
companion product for on-the-go application. The ANEW Reversalist re-stage is scheduled for second quarter and will
launch in multiple markets.
So overall, I'm feeling good about the progress we're making on improving both the push and pull of our business, the
continuing improvements to our two core processes around field management and commercial marketing and have a
strong innovation pipeline across our product categories.
So just to summarize before handing off to Kimberly for a detailed review of the quarter's performance, we are facing
significant macros, particularly in currency fluctuations, yet we continue to make progress on the turnaround.
Kimberly?
Kimberly A. Ross
Thank you, Sheri. As Sheri indicated, we feel good about the progress we're making in improving some of our internal
processes and operational effectiveness, but this is not yet flowing through to our financial results. In addition, our
quarter one performance was impacted during the quarter by the macroeconomic environment, particularly in Eastern
Europe. Having said that, let me take you through the details of the quarter.
In quarter one, constant dollar revenue declined 3%. On a reported basis, revenue was down 11%, negatively impacted
by foreign exchange. Units declined 6% with softness in all regions but driven by continued declines in North America,
primarily due to a decrease in Active Representatives. Active Representatives were down 4%, driven by the continued
declines in North America. EMEA, Latin America and Asia-Pacific were down as well. Q1 price mix was up 3%, with
increases in most regions led by inflationary pricing in Latin America.
Adjusted gross margin declined 120 basis points to 61.5% due to the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was
largely in EMEA. Adjusted operating margin was down 240 basis points to 6.1% in the quarter. The decline was
primarily due to the currency impact in EMEA as well as deleverage given the weaker revenue. We had expected this
decline given the 200 basis point benefit we had in the year ago quarter that we reminded you about on our last call.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 46.3% compared to 33.8% a year ago. This high rate is partially a result of discrete
items in the quarter. In addition, the quarter rate was impacted by the country mix of earnings. Excluding discrete
impacts, we expect our underlining tax rate for the year to be in the mid-30%s. Adjusted EPS was $0.12 per share
compared to $0.26 per share a year ago.

Turning to Latin America, Q1 revenue rose 7% in constant dollars primarily due to the strength in average order, which
continues to benefit from price increases across the region. Price mix was up 8% primarily due to inflationary pricing in
Venezuela. Active Representatives and units both declined 1%. Brazil constant dollar revenue was up 5%, driven by
average order, which benefited from continued strength in Fashion & Home as well as Beauty. Fashion & Home was
up 11%, and Beauty rose 4% in constant dollars. Beauty sales growth was partially due to strong results in skincare
driven by sun care.
Our successful Avon Color line also contributed, supported by the strong launch of Mega Effects Mascara. We are
pleased that we are having the success with significantly higher pricing. As you may recall, Brazil had a benefit
associated with excise taxes in quarter one 2013 that added approximately two points to last year's constant dollar
revenue growth. This was offset by a bad credit that we recognized in this year's quarter. Since they were similar in
size, there was no material impact on Brazil's growth rate in the quarter. As I've indicated in the past, the Brazil tax
environment is very complex, and we continue to step up our efforts in this area. As a result, we could have more
impact from this in coming quarters, and we will continue to call out anything material.
Turning to Mexico, revenue was down 8% in constant dollars, driven by declines in both Active Representatives and
lower average orders. While we still have a lot of work to do to improve performance in Mexico, we are pleased that
we saw improvement in the rate of decline in quarter one. I was recently in Mexico, and it is very clear that it is a
highly competitive beauty market with heavy discounting, particularly at retail. We have made progress adjusting
pricing after the missteps last year and are seeing some improvements in average order as a result. We also remain
focused on working with our sales leaders to improve representative appointments and in finding ways to drive
representative retention.
Venezuela revenue was up 54% in constant dollars. The growth was driven by an increase in average order, largely due
to inflationary pricing. Units were down due to macro factors that continue to be disruptive. I'll come back and talk
about the impact of the Venezuela currency in a moment. Latin America's adjusted operating margin was 8.2%, down
170 basis points. Gross margin declined due to the negative impact of currency. Higher net brochure costs and higher
administrative expenses, both driven by inflation in Venezuela, were also factors.
As we look forward, we feel good about the progress that we've made in Latin America to date. Venezuela has its own
challenges, but we are pleased with how the team is managing in a very difficult environment. We are continuing to
stay close to the business and are working to mitigate risk where possible. In Mexico, we also have work to do but feel
that the business is moving in the right direction. Brazil is making good progress on its strategic goals, including
launching locally relevant new beauty products and maintaining strength in Fashion & Home. Across the region, we
need to stay vigilant on improving processes in the field, marketing and cost management to ensure that we continue to
make progress in improving overall results.
Moving to EMEA, revenue declined 5% in constant dollars. Units and Active Representatives in EMEA both declined
6% partly because we entered the quarter with lower representative count. EMEA was weaker than expected, with
much of the softness due to Russia. In addition, currency headwinds across the region were worse than we expected,
making our results more challenging. Revenue in Russia declined 11% in constant dollars, primarily due to a decrease
in Active Representatives. As already mentioned, we went into quarter one with weaker representative count. However,
we put in place initiatives to bring representative count back up, and we are making some progress in this area.
Continued weak results in the U.K. had an impact on the region, but we believe we are moving in the right direction. In
South Africa, constant dollar revenue rose 1%, primarily due to an increase in Active Representatives. Results in South
Africa were negatively impacted by a postal strike during the quarter that prevented us from shipping orders to many of
our representatives. I was recently in this market and spent time in the field, and it was clear how disruptive the postal
strike was. The good news is that the business has already resumed normal activities. Adjusted operating margin in
EMEA was 10.6%, down 590 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange partly due to the benefit in Q1 2013, which we had previously highlighted to you. Deleverage due to weaker
volumes also had an impact.

Looking forward, EMEA is challenging, given the macroeconomics as well as the currency weakness, particularly
across Eastern Europe. We are working to mitigate the impact of the currency volatility with pricing actions, though we
may not offset the full impact. At the same time, we need to ensure that we manage the price volume equation
thoughtfully to ensure that we are engaging consumers and representatives with unit-moving offers. In addition, we
have plans in place across both field and merchandising programs and expect to witness constant dollar revenue
improvement in this region in the second half, assuming the economic and political situation does not deteriorate.
Turning to North America, this region reported a 21% constant dollar revenue decline. An 18% decline in Active
Representatives was the key driver. Units were down 25%, primarily due to the decline in Active Representatives. In
addition, we believe units were negatively impacted by the reduced depth and frequency of discounting. Both Beauty
and Fashion & Home sales declined 21% in constant dollars. Adjusted North American operating loss was $2.9 million,
primarily due to the impact of lower revenue. Our operating margin was essentially flat year-over-year, despite the 21%
sales decline. We were able to offset most of the deleverage with the cost reduction actions we have been implementing
in the last two quarters.
We still have a lot of work to do in the area of cost reduction and we are approaching this with a detailed analysis of
every cost line of the business. In addition, we continue to focus on getting better returns on every dollar we spend. One
example of this is that we have taken a hard look at all of our field and marketing programs; it did not repeat a large
recruitment event from last year that was ineffective. Instead, we are investing in new programs that are expected to
generate better returns and drive savings as a result. We are analyzing how we can do things differently and instilling a
culture of measurable return on investments. We feel good about the early progress we are making in this area. Stabling
North America is key in order for us to achieve our financial targets. We will continue to keep you posted on our
progress.
In Asia-Pacific, revenue declined 10% on a constant dollar basis. Active Representatives declined 8%, while units were
down 12%. Philippines revenue declined 1% on a constant dollar basis due to a lower number of Active
Representatives; average order was up. China constant dollar revenue was down 42%, primarily due to declines in the
number of beauty boutiques. Adjusted operating margin was 4.8% in Asia-Pacific, down 320 basis points. This was
largely due to higher obsolescence as well as the unfavorable net impact of pricing and mix. The impact of lower
revenue on our fixed cost was also a factor. Asia-Pacific overall remains challenging, and we expect results to remain
soft in the near term. Our new Head of Asia is fully engaged in the business and will keep you posted on our progress.
Now I'll take you through the three adjustments we made to our GAAP results in the quarter, starting with Venezuela.
In the quarter, we adopted the SICAD II foreign exchange rate of approximately VEF50 to US$1 to re-measure our
Venezuelan business. This rate represents the recognition of a devaluation of approximately 88%. We adopted this
SICAD II exchange rate for re-measurement because it represents the rate that better reflects the economics of Avon
Venezuela's business activity as well as the fact that it is the rate at which we have recently been able to access limited
dollars. As a result of the change to this rate, we recorded several charges, all of which are outlined in our press release
as well as our 10-Q. And we do expect further charges for the remainder of 2014, primarily during quarter two.
The adoption of the SICAD II rate was effective March 31, 2014. As a result, we re-measured our balance sheet in
quarter one, but did not use it to re-measure the P&L. This will not have an impact on our constant dollar results in
2014 since we will be using the VEF6.3 exchange rate for current and prior periods. We will see the P&L impact of
re-measuring at SICAD II beginning in quarter two, where our reported revenue and adjusted operating profit will be
lower due to the much smaller business in Venezuela. It will have an impact on constant dollar results starting 2015,
since we update our constant dollar exchange rates on an annual basis. If we had used the SICAD II rates in our
calculation of constant dollar revenue growth, Latin America's constant dollar revenue growth for quarter one would've
been 2% rather than 7% that we reported. The total company revenue would've been down 5% in constant dollars.
During the quarter, we also recorded CTI restructuring charges within operating profit of approximately $23 million
pre-tax. This was largely due to employee costs related to the elimination of approximately 650 positions. This brings
the total number of head count reductions related to our $400 million cost reduction initiative to approximately 3,100.
Lastly, as Sheri indicated, we are pleased to announce that we reached an understanding on terms of settlement for the

FCPA investigations. As a result, we recorded an additional accrual of $46 million, bringing the total accrual to $135
million, which is the expected amount of the settlement. In addition to the above adjustments, we also made a change to
the calculation of the metric, change in Active Representatives, to better align the internal and external KPIs. We don't
expect this change to have any impact on the Active Representative count for the full year. Active Representatives
would have been down 6% for quarter one instead of the 4% we reported. This is primarily due to the shift in billing
days to quarter one from quarter two last year due to the timing of Easter.
Moving on to cash flow, cash flow from operations was a use of $113 million for quarter one, about the same as a year
ago. The overall net cash used for quarter one was $313 million, compared with the cash provided of $279 million for
the same period in 2013. This increase in the use of cash is primarily due to the cash used by operating activities as well
as significant exchange rate impact on cash balances, largely due to the Venezuela bolivar. Additionally, financing
transactions, in the first quarter of 2013 benefited cash flow a year ago. Our net debt for quarter one was $1.9 billion,
which is up $299 million from year-end 2013 due to lower cash balances, partly due to Venezuela. In quarter one, we
also continued to make progress in working capital which operationally improved eight days compared with a year ago.
Accounts payable improved 11 days operationally, as we continued to focus on renegotiating payment terms with our
vendors. However, inventory worsened three days operationally, mainly due to weaker sales. Working capital and
inventory, in particular, remain a key area of focus for us as we work to improve cash flow.
Looking ahead, we are basically on track with what we told you on our last call. For Q2, we expect trends to be a bit
better but to still be down in revenue and operating margins versus a year ago. We expect to resume constant dollar
sales and margin growth in the second half of the year, driven by improvements in several of our key markets. In
addition, this all assumes that currency, economic and political environments remains roughly the same as it is today.
With that said, I'll hand it back to Sheri.
Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thank you, Kimberly. So as I said at the top of the call, I am not satisfied with our performance, but I am encouraged
by our progress. We must drive top-line growth and ensure we continue to improve our cost base. And we will need to
continue to manage the business in a challenging macro environment.
In closing, I'm confident we are headed in the right direction, and we will continue to make progress toward our
financial goals.
Thank you, and I'll now turn it over for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation and post your
question.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Thanks. It's Wells Fargo. Sheri, I guess you said you're happy with the progress that you are
making, but some of the improvements aren't showing up in the financials yet. I was hoping you can give a little more
detail on that. Why is that? Why aren't they showing up yet? And on a related basis, how can you be confident that big
markets like Russia and Mexico can get back on track and grow again in the second half of the year? And is that related
to this stuff that you're making progress on but isn't showing up yet? So just any detail you can give on that with some
specificity would be fantastic.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. Thanks, Chris. One of the things that's critically important for us, if we take a step
back and look at our business, we need to make sure we have the management teams at the local level focused on the
critical drivers. And that's about the field getting Active Representatives and looking at how we make the earnings

opportunity great for them through new products. And as we look at some of the areas where we've stumbled and we've
had challenges, and I'll point to Mexico, what we're seeing now is the team is back blocking and tackling and focusing
on that.
And even if you look at Q1 today versus where we were in Q4, we're seeing progress and we're seeing the right focus
there. So, it's really making sure that as we look at those key components on the ground, that people are focused on
those. We are also seeing in Russia, as Kimberly mentioned, they started off slow relative to the active rep count. While
they have a lot of work to do there, particularly given the over-pinning of the political environment, they are making
progress as it relates to the Active Representatives. And really what drives growth in our core business is having more
Active Representatives who are selling more.
And so the confidence I see is that while we aren't where we need to be because we're starting, in some cases, from a
place behind, we are seeing movement and improvement in those areas. And so that's what I'm talking about when I say
it gives me confidence. The same is true as I look at some of the work that the teams are doing across the businesses as
it relates to getting cost out. That takes time, but as I look at the plans and where we are, we're making good progress.
Obviously, we're dealing with more macros and FX than we had anticipated. But knowing what we're working on both
in North America, across the regions, as well as at the corporate level, we are looking at how we drive cost and be more
efficient and effective. That is not coming through at this point. Thanks, Chris.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: And I guess just as a related follow-up, I mean, the terms you're using: blocking and tackling;
on the ground; more reps; better new products; right. I think what the market's having trouble with is understanding
what exactly is going on in a more specific way. I guess is there any chance you can – I mean, pick one market. Pick a
market of your choosing, right, and just give more specifics on what you're doing to get more reps; what you're doing to
drive new products. I mean anything that would give you something tangible to hang on to would be great, if there's
any chance you can do that?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. So in the case of – I'll pick Mexico, and Kimberly, feel free to chime in, as you were
just there. Mexico has been very focused on how they do recruiting differently and looking at how they get
consecutivity and keeping people in the business longer. And so they're doing things with insurance programs, social
security, as they look at how to keep people in the field. So they're looking at how to have a competitive advantage and
what the benefit is of joining Avon. So that's an example of what they are doing.
On the product side, one of the things that we see is we have an opportunity to build brands, and look at how we do 360
activation. And so as I look at some of the work behind Mega Effects in Latin America, they look at how to drive it
through the field and give their representatives incentives, and at the same time do a lot of social media, and do other
things to get people excited about that product.
So, it's very specific, but it is about making sure that every time the representative touches Avon, she's excited and
wants to go out and sell. And that's a combination of incentivizing her and making sure that it's easy for her to do
business with us, and at the same time, making sure she has the products that are easy to sell. And I mentioned
Argentina. A great example that they're focused on is how they look at top representatives and segmenting things
differently to get people to come in. So, it is blocking and tackling on the ground, but it's very specific on those two
processes of recruiting and retention, which is the field, and looking at how we create excitement, which is the product
offerings.

Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi, Good morning. Hey, I looked at the proxy, and the long-term incentive comp, I guess,
is all tied to getting to mid single digit organic top-line growth and double-digit margin. So can you just give us a little
bit more color on the path to get there, and how it looks over the next three years as you get closer to that payout year?

<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: I'm not sure I'm following your question, Bill. I mean, certainly as we look at it, all of our
compensation is tied to the long-term, which is really the goals that we've set out, which is mid single digit top-line
growth, double-digit operating margin. And the compensation is tied to the top-line – long-term is tied to the top-line
and to that margin. And so the team is very, very focused on making sure we hit those goals. And so we are
incentivized to make sure that the team is focused against those and driving that business. So, I think that we're in sync
between what we're saying to the market and how this company is compensated.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Okay. My question was more, is it going to be gradual. So like, the way you guys have it
planned, I mean, we'll have incremental progress every year or is it going to be flat, flat, flat, and then 2016 savings
come through, the base is low, and you hit the numbers? I don't think it's cumulative, right? It's just by 2016 you have
to have – in that year?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: I'm sorry. I understand what you're saying, Bill. It's compounded annual growth for sales. So
certainly, it's important for us to continue to make sure that we're looking at it on an ongoing basis.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Okay. And you still have comfort given some of the recent trends? Is that still reasonably
achievable?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. We're certainly comfortable in our goals. I think the challenge that we have, as we've
talked to, is how to manage the macro issues, and we're working through that. And I think the other challenge is really,
as we've talked quite a bit in the past, is about getting North America to profitability in 2015. That's an important part
of achieving our goals.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Great, thanks. And then just on the decision to go to the SICAD II rate, nobody else in the
industry has done that yet. Is it because you needed to get the cash out? Or why did you decide to take a flyer, or is it
just like let's rip off the Band-Aid and move forward?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: No, Bill, we spent a lot of time on this. I spent a lot of time on this, as well as the rest of the
team. And it really is dependent on the circumstances of each company. And so we really felt like the SICAD II rate
better reflected the overall operating environment of the company. But also, as I mentioned, it's the rate at which we
have been able to recently access small levels of dollars. So, there are a couple other companies that are not, I admit, in
the beauty industry, that have gone to this SICAD II rate. And again, we just felt that it was what better represents,
overall, the business environment that we're in, in Venezuela.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, from Citigroup. My question is on rep count because I think you called out very early
on that what you need to do to get to stronger revenue growth is to get more reps, but the decline in reps continues to be
stunning. I know you talked about what you're doing in Mexico. But I guess, particularly in the U.S., can you talk about
your visibility on either a smaller rate of decline in the rep count or whether you think your rep count's actually going
to be up year-over-year in the back half? And what gives you confidence on the recruiting part of it?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, as we look at North America, they've been very focused on the field, as you heard
Pablo speak at CAGNY. What we're still seeing is that we have a lot of work to do in terms of getting sales leaders
focused on recruiting – and they are, but also working to make sure that we're retaining representatives. And so it's a
combination of making sure that, as we're bringing people in, we're bringing people in that have the opportunity to earn
and stay with us.
Last year, at this point in time, Kimberly mentioned that we had made some changes this year in terms of recruiting.
Last year, we did a lot of recruiting; spent a lot of money. We brought people in only to have them leave a few months
later, and that really wasn't advantageous for us. So, one of the areas that we're spending a lot of time on is looking at

how do we do a better job of recruiting and do it in a way that attracts people that want to stay with Avon. And that, to
me, is probably, Wendy, or all the things that we focus on, on a regular basis and have a lot of conversations around is
really this whole area of recruiting.
And so, it's an area where we need to do it in a smart way. But at the same time, we recognize this is something that we
need to get our arms around as we exit 2014 into 2015 to get to profitability. So, I wish I had a better answer. It's one
that we continue to look at really hard and make sure we're doing the right things. But at this point in time, we're
assuming we're staying the course in the short-term in the first half of this year in terms of the numbers.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: And just on the U.S. specifically, you talked about lower levels of discounting and
promotion. Is that a kind of new commitment here to stay? I mean if that means that there's even more rep attrition, is
that a trade-off you're willing to make? And just again, do you think that rep count – I mean, forget about the first half,
but starting in the third quarter, do you think overall company rep count is going to be up? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: As I look at the pricing piece of it, a lot of work has been done in North America
evaluating what's the appropriate depth of discount; the frequency of discount. And in some cases, we may have pushed
too far where we've cut it so that we perhaps were not giving enough frequency of discount and we've done a lot of
work. And as we build in the second half – the plans in the second half, we're really incorporating that, particularly as
we look at skincare, and that's the area of focus for us. As we look at rep count for the year, we can't comment on that
right now as it relates to the total company. I will say, as I talked about the blocking and tackling piece that the
organization and the market and their KPIs are around Active Representatives and around their average order, which is
around the marketing part of the business. And so that's really where we're focused.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. I am from Bernstein. I had a couple of just quick clarification ones and then a real one.
The two clarifications were this deferred prosecution agreement. And I apologize, I'm not familiar enough in it. But
with it – in your Q it says that what it means is it defers for three years, that criminal prosecution by the DOJ. Does that
mean in three years, there will be criminal prosecution, or is it kind of a vague, I guess, agreement? And the second
piece of clarification is on Venezuela. I'm just – it's rare that we've seen people go to SICAD II, but it's also rare that
we've seen people use the VEF6.3, for example, for the income statement and then a different rate for the
non-monetary. So, I'm trying to understand how that works. Does that make any sense? And is there a little bit of optics
in there? Because if you did go to SICAD II on the income, it would be another like 8% or 9% hit to the operating
profit. So those are two kind of just clarifications, if you could, please.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure, Ali. On the deferred prosecution agreement, there is – if we comply during that
three-year period with the monitor and what we agreed to with the government, after three years that goes away. So it's
a non-issue. So it's really about making sure that if we work with the monitor during that 18-month period, and ideally
on our own after that next 18 months, then it will no longer be an issue for us from a criminal standpoint.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: And then just with regards to Venezuela, so, for us, we are not currently accessing at all
SICAD I rates. So for us, it really did not seem to make sense that we go to a rate that we're not accessing at all these
days. And the SICAD II system started later in the quarter and we were able to access it at the very end of the quarter.
So, therefore, under the rules you have to use the balance sheet rate that you have at the end of the quarter, which,
therefore, the balance sheet gets re-measured. But the P&L, being that you operated essentially all three quarters under
a different rate, is required to use the official rate. So thus the reason I called out in my script, the quarter one number,
because we want to make sure we're being transparent about this, that LatAm growth in quarter one would have been
2% rather than 7% had we used the SICAD II rate. And for the total company, it would have been minus 5% versus the
minus 3% that we reported.

<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay, that's real helpful. I appreciate both of those. The broader question is, as I'm hearing what you
said this conference call, previous conference call, at CAGNY, it feels like there are two levers that you are pulling to
try to improve the business on an operational level. So, one is people. So a lot of discussion about we're changing this
person; we're changing this person; we have a new team here. And the other one is around and to use a word from the
earlier question like blocking and tackling or execution and I'm wondering whether that's right. I'm wondering whether
there is a point where perhaps one realizes that there may need to be more kind of dramatic changes; bigger changes.
And just a focus on the U.S. as an example, like, is the rep count even meaningful enough to be a hurdle for you to say,
you know what, we're just going to call up Walmart or call up Walgreens and say, we'll do private-label Avon for you
in-store. Do you ever get, do you think, to the point where you realize that maybe the two levers you're pulling of
people and execution don't get you there, and you've got to do something bigger and more dramatic to the business –
like that example?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes, so as we – as I talked at CAGNY, I talked about the three components of growth. And
one is about driving our core business, the second is about optimizing our geographic portfolio, and the third was
around how do we build brands and look at new channels. As I look at the North American business as an example, it's
important for us to stabilize the core business. At the same time, we recognize we have incredible assets. I mean, if we
look at our new brand, et cetera, we have some great products. What we need to figure out is how we have more
consumers having access to those. And so, one of the things that we are launching in early September is our new
e-commerce site, which will allow representatives to actually have the choice of earning by doing direct business with a
customer or actually having that customer go online and order from her.
At the same time, we will have consumers that will be able to have access where they can come in and shop Avon.
That, to me, I think is a way to not only get our brand name out there but also to get more consumers and more trial for
our business. So those are the kinds of things that we've looked at. And in other markets around the world, as we look
at core, for example, we've talked about – as we look at bringing that into Latin America, we're looking at, what is an
approach that we perhaps might do in a different way that allows us to access more consumers. Thanks, Ali.

Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Morgan Stanley. So you highlighted that you were still comfortable with the long-term
margin goals earlier on the call. Why is that goal still realistic given the year-over-year margin depression we've seen in
the last few quarters here? And then following up on the rep question earlier, can you discuss the need to potentially
increase spending on reps, whether it's recruitment or the earnings opportunity or other areas just given the weak rep
results here?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes. I mean, as it relates to the margin, we still think those are the right goals. And
certainly as we look at some of the work that we've done earlier on in setting those goals, we still are very confident in
those goals. Obviously, the key issue we are dealing with right now are the macro issues. As we look at the plans that
we have in place relative to what the teams are working on to drive costs out and get the return on investment piece, I
feel good about that. What we're managing through right now is tough times relative to the macro situation. And then
on the reps – did you have anything else on the margin, anything else you wanted to comment? Okay. Could you just
repeat the comment on the reps?
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Yeah, I'm just wondering do you need to increase spending levels on rep activities,
whether it's recruiting reps in or the earnings opportunity for reps once they are on board, just given some of the rep
results we've seen recently in the year-over-year declines there.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, this is Kimberly. One of the things we have been very focused on is really analyzing
the spend that we have in the field and with the reps. And I've said it before, and I still really believe it, that at this point
I still believe that it's more about getting a better return for every dollar we spend versus spending more. And so one of
the things, for example, in Latin America that we've done recently is we've implemented a more rigorous process to

analyze the money that we're spending in the field. And then, doing the postmortem on some of the – on the spend that
we have. And we found that we've had some inefficient and ineffective spend. And so, this helps us not only get –
make sure that we don't spend more, but really look at what is working and what is not working by implementing more
discipline in the field.
The same thing is taking place here in the U.S. I mentioned the one item where last year we had this very large
recruitment effort that took place. And, quite frankly, we found that the money we spent really didn't give us a return.
So it's being about more focused, more targeted and making sure that – as we've said before, we have to connect the
dots, because we have to have the right product, we have to have the right marketing behind it, to then make sure that –
combined with the right propositions for the representatives. So, at least from my perspective, at this point, it really is
about how do we get a better return for the spend versus spending more.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: And one of the things that we – I hear from representatives when I travel around the world,
it doesn't really matter where I am, and even the state of the business. What they will consistently say to me is that they
want great products. They want to be proud to be part of Avon, so they want us to invest in the brand as well as the
products, because that allows them to earn. So, to me it's really the earnings-to-effort ratio that we need to continue to
work on.

Your next question comes from Olivia Tong. Please state your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thanks. It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. On U.S. profitability, you guys – we alluded to a
couple times already, but can you talk about some of the process changes that you referenced during your prepared
remarks?
You also talked about the depth and frequency of discounting lowering that. But it sounds like in your follow-up
comments that this was more of a one-off. There was an event in the year ago that you decided not to do again. Is this
really a step change in your thought process?
And can you also follow-up and tell us like, what is the field telling you? Are there any specifics in terms of not just
making more money or doing more with less and things like that? But are there specific things that they are telling you
that you can implement as we go forward? Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: So, I think, there are quite a few questions in one, so I'll try to tackle it. With regards to
process – and I think that's a key point, and it's something that we've talked to in the past throughout Avon that we need
to improve processes. This is an area where a lot of effort is taking place, and we're really starting to see things being
done differently.
And part of it is, again, this connecting the dots, making sure that marketing and sales as well as finance and supply
chain and everybody are working together and getting these processes in a cohesive manner. And I think, a lot of work
is taking place there, and I actually hear folks here in the office saying, wow, this is actually starting to feel different.
But it does take time. And it's a mindset change. But I think, they're focusing on the right things. And we're also, at the
same time, in those meetings now having more in-depth discussions about the depth of discount, about the products,
about the productivity of the brochure, as well as the impact on the field.
Pablo is very focused on the field. He understands the field very well. He has been out and about, and continues to be
out and about listening to what's working for the representatives and not working for representatives, and making those
changes. So, I do think things are being looked at differently.

On a cost perspective, we're currently in an exercise going through line by line, and not just looking at where do we
take costs out but how do we do things differently to get efficiency and ultimately also get cost out.
Sheri, I don't know, if there is something you want to add.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: No. The only other comment I would make is some of the changes that we made in second
half, just to address your question about whether it was one-off, is we actually significantly reduced our head count.
We've made some changes in other areas, in supply chain, etcetera, and those changes are what's flowing through in
addition to Kimberly's point, where we're continuing to look at processes, as we move forward. So it's a combination of
the two.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Got it. And then just following up, can you give a little bit of a broader update on Brazil? Clearly,
there has been quite a bit more competition that's picked up there, and you've still managed to grow despite difficult
comps. So can you just elaborate a little bit more on the state of the market in Brazil? Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. So Brazil is a very competitive market, and certainly a lot of formidable competitors.
With that said, I'm very pleased with what the team there has been doing. Again, they've done a very nice job on the
blocking and tackling, as it relates to the fundamentals in the field, as well as their marketing execution around new
products.
They are continuing to look at how they focus on the beauty business and make sure we continue to build our beauty
brand. Lot of work on fragrance and improving in that area. They've also done a nice job on skin and sun care.
So they are focusing on the basics, making sure that they're getting people excited about Avon and bringing people in
and making sure they're selling Avon products over other competitors. Still a lot more work to be done there, but I
mentioned our launch of Encanto. That's a great example.
That was actually in a body care line, a little bit higher-end, it was did by the team in Brazil working with the global
team rolling that out, and now we're transferring that to the broader Latin American base. That's a great example of
how to make sure we're staying true to the Brazilian consumer and the Brazilian representatives.
And so they've done a very nice job there and continue to work in a very competitive environment, but they're staying
close to the consumer and the representative.

Your next question comes from Steve Powers. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Yeah. Hi. It's UBS. Thanks. I know you said that you see your imperative mainly as getting a
better return on investments rather than spending more.
But so many of the initiatives that you've cited seem aimed to me, in terms of reinvigorating growth, it seemed aimed to
me at steadily increasing investments, whether it's pricing, representative support, branding, innovation, technology.
And your competitors, to Olivia's point, are certainly investing more.
So, in that context, how are you thinking really still about improving both margins, and I'd add to that, free cash flow
alongside the top-line recovery? I mean, even over a two- to three-year period, is that really realistic, especially given
Venezuela, Argentina now positioned to be such a material headwind?
I think, in the – if you can correct me – I think, in the quarter, those two markets were 15% of operating profit. So, it
seems like a lot of that's going away in the future. So it's in that context that I ask this question about investment in
margin to drive top-line and whether you can really make those two line items work in concert with one another.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I think, one thing we have to look at is on a market by market basis, and it's not a one
size fits all decision. So as we look at where we're making investments, as an example, we would be more likely to

make investments in Brazil because we think there's an opportunity for us to drive growth, et cetera.
What we're saying when we're making that trade-off is we may not be making investments in other areas where we
don't see the benefit from a growth standpoint. So as we work in the individual markets, they each have their goals and
their targets. And it's clear whether they're driving growth or whether we're focusing on keeping the business more
steady. So, from that standpoint, that's what we're talking about.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Okay. Maybe Kimberly, is half of your SG&A still variable, or more than half? I think that's
what you said at CAGNY a few years ago, and given that, are there enough fixed costs to actually cut to offset those
investments?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. It's about still 50% variable versus floating. And again, we need to keep in mind just
how much costs went up over the years also. So, I still think there is plenty of opportunity to get fixed cost out.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: ...new growth. So how much of the anticipated second-half improvement comes from
easier comparisons versus real improvement in specific markets? And in that context, could you actually give a couple
of markets, or several markets, or however you feel comfortable doing it, where you actually expect to see
improvement?
And then just second question, also related to the last question, so $200 million of cost savings so far, by my math,
seems mostly from head count reductions. How much more is there? Or is $400 million still the right number?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: So first, if we talk about where is the improvement coming from in the second half of the
year. So, yes, there is some benefit, obviously, to the easier comps in the second half of the year. But with that said,
what we're expecting are improvements in some of our key markets.
So we are looking for improvements. We've talked about Mexico before. And we're looking for improvement in other
markets also, including stemming some of the declines in some markets. And again, as we said, it is based on the
assumption that overall macros don't get worse, in the political arena also.
With regards to cost, we've said that with regards to the cost savings that we've achieved about a third of it, is what
we've said. And, yes, there has been quite a bit of head count reduction, but we've also reduced costs with regards to
brochures. We've reduced costs in legal. We've shut down some facilities. We've exited some markets.
So we've done quite a few things there, and we're continuing to work through additional initiatives in order to get
additional costs out. So I do believe that there continues to be opportunity there, and it's something that we're working
on.
Obviously, we've faced some headwinds in costs. So significant inflation in Venezuela, in Argentina with regards to
supply chain, as well as the foreign exchange impacts that we've had. But we're continuing to focus on getting the costs
out.
And I think the U.S. is a great example, where despite the decline in the top-line this quarter, they were able to maintain
the same margin that they had last year, thus offsetting the impact due to cost savings initiatives.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Just relating to the first question, what markets can you point to, to say that you're actually
going to see growth in the back half of the year, beyond Brazil, which has been solid?

<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, Russia is one market that we're focusing on the improvement and expecting
improvement in the latter part of the year. And, again, leadership is one of the key areas in Russia that we're driving in
order to improve rep count. We came out with a low rep count in Russia at the end of last year. We saw some
improvement in that in quarter one, so we're starting to see some closing of the gap. And by focusing on leadership,
we're looking for some additional improvement there in the overall rep count.

Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning. It's BMO. I think, you mentioned in your remarks that you were
starting to recruit in high-potential districts in North America. Could you give us some examples of how you're training
the leadership reps to actually focus in these areas? And what's happening in the districts you wouldn't consider high
potential, because I'm trying to understand where the tipping point is. Do the districts that don't have a lot of potential,
do the reps keep dropping off there, and do they drag down the results until the high-potential districts really pick up
steam?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, so we have some districts, and when I talk about high potential, those are the districts
that are profitable, and we're seeing good performance. We have other ones where we have challenges.
What we're looking at is how do we – and, again, it goes back to it's not a one size fits all approach. How do we make
sure that we're incentivizing the districts that are doing well and making sure that they're getting the support and the
sales leaders who are doing well in terms of recruiting, so that they have the resources and the tools to be able to go out
and drive that and making choices about how we invest our time and our money. That's really what we're working
through. And Pablo and his team are in the throes of that as we speak. Thanks, Connie.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay. Can I have a follow-up on the KORRES and Coty relationships? Are those up
and running at this point? And if not, when do they start?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure, so the KORRES one is up and running, and we're working closely with that team for
Latin America with their product line. As it relates to Coty, we're still working through that, making good progress
there, but that's something that we're still finalizing the details.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Nik Modi. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yeah, RBC. Just a quick question on advertising. Just, Sheri, if you could share your kind of
philosophical view on where it fits into the entire strategy at Avon because it's been coming down over the last several
quarters. So I'm just curious on how you think about building the brand name; future pricing power through advertising
and along those means.
And if you're not going to be spending in advertising, are we just talking more about rep incentives in terms of
promotional activity, training? Maybe you can provide some perspective around that. Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. Sure. So it's really important for us to continue to build our brand globally. And we
are advertising in some markets where we know we have good breakthrough, so we are doing traditional TV
advertising in some of our key markets in that area.

We have cut back, for example, in North America on recruiting advertising because that really wasn't effective. And so
what we're looking at is different ways to do recruiting. So some of the advertising that you saw in first quarter of last
year in the U.S. was related to rep recruiting advertising. We pulled that down. Still very focused on how we build our
brand. And what we see is we've done really nice job in markets looking at digital, as well as combining that with PR
and social media. And we will do advertising where we think it makes sense. So in markets like Russia, Mexico, Brazil,
we still look at the traditional advertising. But what we find is we do much better job when we then bring in social
media, which is less expensive as well – and PR. So we're committed to it, but we need to make sure that it does, in
fact, makes sense.
What we're seeing now and particularly if we look at the number of followers we have on Facebook and some of our
social media work, is we're seeing a lot more people come in through that vehicle. We know that our representatives
are also using that, but Avon as a company has an opportunity to continue to drive that globally.
So I am still very committed to it. It's just a matter of making sure we do it in the right way and that we get the
breakthrough. For example, in the U.S., it would cost a large amount of money, and I am not sure we'd ever get the
return on that. But there are ways to go out and look at that as we manage social media. Thanks.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yeah, just a quick follow-up then. Many of your competitors have had really good success with
training the reps. It's created more retention, more loyalty. And so I am just curious on – if the spending is going to be
spotty on advertising depending on the market, how do you think about training more holistically at a global level?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Training, particularly on skin care, is probably the biggest thing we can do to help our
representatives. When I travel around, people love ANEW, but what they will say is that they're not clear on how one
product works differently than from another product.
And so, we are investing more in training, and we're looking at that in the U.S., as well as in other markets to make sure
that the representative feels confident about the products that she's talking to her customer about. So we're looking at it
from that standpoint. As well as we're going onto ecommerce and online is how do we do more online to help train
representatives and train consumers about our products, because I think that – again, that word-of-mouth, particularly
in direct selling, is critically important.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone. This is Consumer Edge Research. Don't know whether it would be
useful right now to talk about it's been two years – your financial targets were set up nearly two years ago, and things
have deteriorated significantly. So can you tell us why is it that your financial targets are attainable? What exactly
needs to happen for you to get there?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, certainly we have to get back to growth. I mean, I think, that's where we're focused,
and that's where we're working with the markets. I think we had to get in and understand that we need to get back to the
basics on blocking and tackling as it relates to the fundamentals, and we're doing that. We had some bloated cost
structures that we're working to deal with, and I think, we're making good progress in that area. And that relates to our
core business. And we're continuing to experiment and look at things where we build brands and channels. As I talked
about, the idea of ecommerce, as well as things like KORRES that allow us to tap into a broader consumer base. So, it's
about driving holistically the top-line, as well as looking at how we do that in a cost effective and efficient manner.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: But as a follow-up, if you look at your performance, the last three quarters has been the worst
the company had in 15 years. There is a lot of people who are new to direct selling, including you. To what extent some
of the errors that have been happening in the U.S. and in China are execution errors of the current team, which simply

didn't know direct selling in the first place, so to what extent you can tell us with intellectual honesty that this is going
to get better?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. Well, certainly as we look at the issues in the U.S., the issues in the U.S. have been
going on for a period of time. What I will say is that the U.S. has been run, and continues to be run, by people that have
extensive knowledge in direct selling. One, that was a veteran Avon person and then someone coming in from another
company, as it relates to direct selling. I think, we're working through issues that have been ongoing and addressing
those holistically.
As it relates to talent, I'm very pleased and proud of my management team and the teams in the field. We have a lot of
veteran Avon people as well as veteran direct sellers; as well as fresh thinking as it relates to people coming in from the
business, and we have fresh thinking as it relates to people within Avon. And we're working together in concert to do
the right things for the business for the long term.
It's about getting the fundamentals right and making sure that we can get our business back on track. But we are dealing
with some challenges in some of our markets that have been going on for a period of time. Thanks, Javier.

And your final question will come from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Linda Bolton Weiser>: Hi. B. Riley. First just – I know you don't like to give specific guidance, but is the
improvement you're expecting in the second half in terms of having operating margin expansion year-over-year, is the
plan to end the year for the full year with operating margin expansion on a full-year basis?
And then my second question has to do with the Mexican market. You gave some details on that, and you mentioned it
was a very competitive market; a lot of discounting, especially in regular retail channels. But you didn't really give any
color on what you're doing in terms of that environment, do you discount heavily as well to try to keep up with the
retail channel, or do you try to not discount because you're focusing on recruiting, or what is it that you're doing in that
market given the environment there? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: So, obviously we take into consideration what's taking place in the retail channel. We've
talked about it last year about how we had increased prices at a time when everybody else was decreasing prices, and
that impacted us. So, we've been making some adjustments on our pricing with regards to quarter one, and obviously in
quarter two.
We have talked about our pricing capabilities in the past that they're not as strong as where we'd like them to be. So, it
is an area of focus for us. And obviously, in these times we have the challenge of what goes on in the economy also.
And Mexico specifically, I spent some time with the economists when I was down there. There's a lot of reform that's
taking place, government reform taking place, and I think, we're going to be finding that there are periods of consumer
uncertainty as some of these changes are taking place.
So we are looking at how do we make sure that we have the flexibility to be able to respond to what's taking place in
the overall markets. But, with that said, we're not going to engage in a race to the bottom against traditional retail. I
came from retail, so I know a little bit about how that game can go.
We need to make sure that we have great products that are relevant; that are engaging for our representatives to be able
to sell. And so that's a key component of what we're doing. And we are going to be launching our Encanto line there in
Mexico. So that's an example of providing a differentiating product in that market.
With regards to guidance, as we said, we're not providing guidance for the year. We are saying that we expect to make
progress towards our goals, and that includes seeing the improvement in the second half of the year.
