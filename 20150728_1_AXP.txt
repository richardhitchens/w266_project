MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the American Express Fixed Income Conference Call. Currently, at
this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and
instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host to Kerri Bernstein. You may begin.
Kerri Bernstein
Thank you, Dylan. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain
forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based
on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation materials and in the
company's report on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP
financial measures may be found in the presentation materials, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that
may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that
information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with David Yowan, Executive Vice President and Corporate Treasurer, who will provide
a capital and funding update including some key points related to the company's financial performance. Once Dave
completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session, and will be joined in the room by Ken Paukowits, Vice
President of Investor Relations.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dave.
David L. Yowan
Thank you, Kerri, and thank you all for joining this afternoon's update. I'll review briefly American Express, provide an
overview of the company, touch very briefly on our recent operating performance and our three-year outlook. And then
spend the majority of my remarks talking about our capital and funding management activities.

On slide three, I know many of you in the fixed income investing space are focused on us from an issuing entity
perspective. Slide three provides you with an update of our reported operating segments. We have five that you see in
the middle of this page. We also provide the key operating performance metrics for the first half of the year. These
metrics are, of course, our reported operating results, which – and year-over-year comparisons. In our equity and
earnings call materials, we provide some normalizations or some adjustments of these reported results for some discrete
one-time items, namely the Global Business Travel joint venture that we entered into last year that impacted last year's
results as well as an adjustment for the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
Turning to slide four, we show the American Express business model. We operate in a payments landscape that is
characterized by a variety of traditional and nontraditional competitors. We are a firm that operates and an organization
that operates at all parts of the payments landscape, from merchant acquisition, merchant processing, providing
network authorization, issuer processing and payment issuer capabilities and services. In operating across all parts of
the payments landscape, it allows us to capture the full economics of a payments transaction as well as provides us with
a rich set of data that allows us to manage risk and to build our business more effectively.
Slide five reminds you that in a very evolving payments landscape we bring certain assets, capabilities and
relationships to this changing world. I won't go through all of these but you can see some of the things that distinguish
the American Express as we compete with the traditional and nontraditional competitors that I showed you on the prior
page, including our trusted brand, our award-winning customer service and the relationships we have with a variety of
other institutions across the globe.
Turning to slide seven, this is a slide that we have shared previously and describes a three-year financial outlook that
we provided to the marketplace during the first quarter of this year. I'll just spend a few minutes reminding you of that
outlook and the key assumptions and drivers behind it.
On the top part of the page, we describe what we call the core underlying performance of the firm, and those three
elements of that core underlying performance include revenue growth, operating expense leverage and capital strength.
If you think about the performance of the firm over the last several years, those key elements – revenue growth in
mid-single digits, strong discipline on operating expense, and capital distributions including share repurchases that have
lowered our share count – have allowed us to create EPS growth that has been at, or near, our long term on average and
over time targets of 12% to 15%.
As we have had that performance, we have managed through various underlying headwinds in the business. These
would include historically things like higher rewards costs, increasing tax rate, changes in our credit provision, et
cetera.
Beginning in 2015, we also well experienced some very discrete impacts in addition to that core underlying
performance. Our performance to-date through the first half of the year is more or less – that core underlying
performance is more or less in line with our performance over the preceding few periods. The discrete impacts that will
impact our performance in 2015 include a significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the global currencies in
the markets in which we operate.
In the co-brand space there's really three separate impacts. One impact is that beginning in the fourth quarter of last
year we renewed and extended some of our key co-brand relationships, with Delta Airlines, for example, with
Starwood, with Cathay Pacific, British Airways and with Iberia Airlines as well. Those relationships and the contract
terms have attractive economics, but not as attractive economics as the deals that they replace or extend. And so part of
our operating performance this year will be impacted by the economics in those extended deals.
The second discrete impact in the co-brand space is the failure to renew our contract, our merchant acceptance contract,
at Costco in Canada. That agreement terminated last year and that is impacting our metrics in the current year. And the
third and final co-brand impact is the decision not to renew or extend our co-brand and merchant acceptance contracts
with Costco in the United States. The contract we have with them is scheduled to expire on March 31 of 2016, and so
the renewals and the Costco Canada impacts create the two red arrows going down in 2015. The non-renewal of the
Costco United States co-brand and merchant acceptance contracts creates the two red arrows in 2016.

In order to anticipate the non-renewal of the Costco contract, the incremental growth initiatives in 2015 are incremental
marketing promotion and other investments that we have consciously decided to make to prepare ourselves to replace
in part the volumes and the profitability associated with the Costco U.S. co-brand contract. If you look across the page,
you'll see that those impacts in 2015 cumulatively we would expect to result in EPS for the year that is flat to modestly
down.
Then in 2016, we would expect to return to positive EPS growth, and then in 2017, with the key assumption that we
have lapped all the co-brand grow-over impacts as well as have a neutral foreign exchange impact in 2016 and 2017,
we would return to EPS growth rates more in line with our on average and over time target of 12% to 15%.
Turning next to our credit performance on slides eight and nine, our worldwide lending rates remain at or near historic
lows. That's on slide eight. And we remain – our credit quality remains best-in-class. If you look at slide nine, you'll see
that delinquency rates also remain very low and stable and also are best-in-class across the industry.
Slide 10 gives you another perspective on credit quality using data from the Credit Card Securitization Trust's most
recent data available, this shows both the percentage of assets in those securitization trusts that on the left-hand side,
the percentage of total assets with a FICO score below 660, and on the right-hand side the percentage of assets with a
FICO score in excess of 720. As I think you know, American Express sponsors two separate securitization trusts, one
for our charge card products and the other for our loan products, and both of our trusts have the lowest amount of
below 660 and the highest percentage of above 720 of FICO.
Turning to page 11 and then to page 12, we get into a funding and capital management update. Slide 12 is designed to
provide you a summary of all the regulatory requirements that American Express on a consolidated basis and our two
principal banking subsidiaries in the U.S., American Express Centurion Bank, AECB, and American Express Federal
Savings Bank, FSB, are subject to. You can see that as a bank holding company, we are subject from a liquidity
perspective to Dodd-Frank liquidity stress testing requirements. We are also subject to the liquidity coverage ratio.
Both of those are effective at the beginning of this year and we believe we are fully compliant with both of those
requirements.
From a capital perspective, we are a CCAR bank and received a non-objection to our 2015 AXP capital plan on a
quantitative as well as a qualitative basis. Beginning in the first quarter of this year, we began to report the
supplemental leverage ratio as part of our reported capital ratio results, and I would remind you that our reported capital
ratios are measured and calculated using the Basel standardized approach. We are an advanced approach bank and are
just completing our sixth quarter in so-called internal parallel run. As a bank holding company, we are also subject to
numerous other regulations. We have filed a public part of our resolution plan. It's available on the Fed's website, and
we are also subject to the Volcker Rule that we don't believe will have any material impact on our operations.
Slide 13 is the capital management framework that drives our balance sheet management activities. We are committed
to a strong balance sheet, maintaining a flexible business model that allows us to go through severe macroeconomic
stress and maintain strength and flexibility in our balance sheet. We've been able to maintain a strong balance sheet,
have return on equity results that are in excess of our on average and over time target of 25%, and we've done that
while distributing significant percentages of the capital that we generate to our shareholders as well as funding the
growth in our business.
Slide 14 gives you a time series of both the percentage of capital generated that we have distributed to shareholders,
that's what the columns are at the bottom of the slide. And then the line chart gives you a history of our Tier 1 common
and Tier 1 capital ratios. So you can see that we have distributed substantial and significant amounts of capital
generated over this time and still managed to increase our capital ratios over this period. The point where the Tier 1
common and Tier 1 capital lines separate reflects our issuance beginning in the fourth quarter of last year of some
preferred securities that qualify as Tier 1 capital.
Slide 15 gives you a sequential decline in our capital ratios from Q1 to Q2. On the prior page, we noted that we
distributed 97% of capital generated during the quarter. The sequential decline is largely driven by a seasonal increase
in risk-weighted assets, an increase that we experience in every second quarter of the year.

Slide 16 reminds you that our reported ratios under the Basel standardized approach are still transitional. The fully
phased-in Basel requirements, which will be effective in 2019, would lower our reported ratios, as you can see here, by
60 basis points in the case of common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based, and 40 basis points in terms of the
supplemental leverage ratio.
Slide 17 shows the results of the mid-year stress test under the severely adverse scenario that we recently posted to our
Investor Relations website. And what we've done here is lay side by side some of the key metrics from the severely
adverse scenario that we disclosed as part of CCAR 2015 – those are the numbers under the 2015 column on slide 17 –
and compared them to results under very similar macroeconomic scenarios, but six months later in time as part of the
2015 mid-year stress test.
As we talk about in the materials that are on our website, one of the key differences in assumptions between our CCAR
severely adverse scenario stress test and our mid-year stress test is that we did the mid-year stress test, we did it
knowing that the Costco co-brand and merchant acceptance agreements would not be renewed beyond March 31 of
2016. And our baseline scenario included those incremental growth initiatives that I talked about on the prior page.
If you look at the results side by side, you'll see that the net income before taxes and the minimum stressed ratios in
each of these scenarios are relatively consistent. The big difference is a sharp increase in the ending capital ratios,
again, in the severe macroeconomic scenario. That's associated with significantly lower risk-weighted assets, assuming
that, again, in this, the Costco co-brand agreement is not renewed, while it was assumed that it would be renewed in
CCAR.
Turning to slide 18, we just remind you again of some of our key funding sources and contingent sources of liquidity.
We continue to remain committed to scale and relevance in our three major funding programs: deposits, unsecured debt
as well as ABS. We maintain a significant amount of on balance sheet liquidity in the form of cash and really
marketable securities and also have other sources of liquidity including secured financing facilities, our two U.S. banks
have collateral that's eligible at the Fed discount window and we maintain a set of committed bank facilities here in the
U.S. as well as in some select overseas markets.
Slide 19 gives you a time series of the amount of funding that we've had outstanding over the last three years as well as
gives you a sense of the mix of that funding across the three major programs. You'll see that the amounts have grown
steadily, particularly as our loan book has grown in the mid-single digit range over the last several years, and the mix
has remained relatively constant. The mix change is primarily a function of the mix of assets across our different
issuing entities and therefore is driven more by business mix than by financing decisions on our part.
Slide 20 delves in and provides a little more detail around our deposit programs here in the U.S., our retail deposit
programs. These are all programs that we initiated post-financial crisis in 2008, and you can see they continue to grow
nicely. The largest component of our deposit program is our direct-to-consumer program products offered under
personal savings from American Express.
Slide 21 shows the maturity of a select group of those funding programs. This is a debt and CDs with definite maturity
dates.
Slide 22 shows both our historical issuance activity across unsecured and ABS markets, as well as provides an updated
funding range amount and mix for 2015. Back in the first quarter, we announced a $3 billion to $9 billion range for
unsecured debt issuance during 2015 and a $3 billion to $9 billion funding range for ABS during 2015. Our revised
outlook, which you see on slide 22, is now looking for an unsecured debt issuance amount in calendar year 2015 of
between $8 billion and $12 billion and an ABS issuance volume of between $2 billion and $4 billion. This change is
primarily related to a business mix that's coming in a little different than we had originally planned.
If you think about unsecured debt issuance, slide 23 reminds you of our five major rated entities, including our two
bank holding companies, the parent company as well as travel related services, our two U.S. banks and then American
Express Credit Corp., which you can see on slide 24 is our largest issuer of unsecured debt and our most frequent
issuer, including a transaction that we priced this afternoon the three-year tenure for $1.4 billion.

With that, we've also included in the materials some additional items in the Appendix and in the Annex that I would
encourage you to look at as well. But at this point operator, I think we can open it up and see if there are any questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Butkus.
<Q - Ryan Thomas Butkus>: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you once again for hosting the call.
<A - David L. Yowan>: Sure.
<Q - Ryan Thomas Butkus>: I just had a question with regards to your issuance estimated range, the $8 billion to $12
billion. Is that all senior, and are you evaluating subordinated or Tier 2 opportunities within this number as well?
<A - David L. Yowan>: Yeah. I think you should assume that it's senior unsecured debt. I think the preferred and
sub-debt transactions that we did in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year certainly, for the
moment, fill the buckets that we've wanted to fill in those two categories.
<Q - Ryan Thomas Butkus>: Okay. And again, just on the 2015 estimated range for unsecured issuance, as you look
at the curve here are you going to continue to look to shorter duration and medium type of duration maturities, or are
you evaluating things longer out on the curve just given where rates are?
<A - David L. Yowan>: Yeah, I think if you look at our historic issuance pattern and the amount outstandings, we
have been strong issuers of both the three and the five year space, and I think you should expect to continue to see that
same preference from us going forward.
<Q - Ryan Thomas Butkus>: Okay. And just one last one from me if I can. The funding strategy slide 19, if we look
at the percentage compositions and just how things have changed year-over-year, you mentioned as the business mix
changes these should fluctuate but are there any targets for specific buckets or percentage buckets for each category?
<A - David L. Yowan>: The short answer is no there are not. Our goal is to have, maintain scale and relevance across
the three major funding programs. If we did that independent of business mix and independent of the fact that we've got
a number of different legal entities, we probably have a third, a third, a third on this page in terms of mix. At one point,
I think we talked about that as a target a couple of years ago. When we manage the legal entities within the company,
the different issuing entities and as different parts of our business grow more or less rapidly than others, that's really
what drives the percentages that you see on this page much more so then financing decisions on our part, financing
strategy decisions on our part.
<Q - Ryan Thomas Butkus>: Okay. Thank you once again.
<A - David L. Yowan>: You bet.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I show our next question and comment comes from [ph] Bill George (28:07).
[Operator Instructions]
<Q>: Hi. Sorry about that. Thank you for hosting the call. I was just wondering in terms of your charge and lending
products if there's any plan to move down the credit spectrum to increase volume or loan portfolio size?
<A - David L. Yowan>: Yeah, so we talked about the fact that we think that lending presents an opportunity for us
going forward. But we believe that that opportunity is really without changing the overall risk profile of our company. I
think there's a lot of opportunities on both the credit and charge card side in terms of increasing the amount of lending

that our card members do with us, that today they do on other competitive products. We also think there are
opportunities even with some of our new products like the everyday product as an example to reach a new demographic
within the population but one that historically really is consistent with our overall risk profile but one where they
historically saw that Amex didn't have a product that was right for them.
So I don't think those opportunities there, those are really opportunities that we think we are able to take advantage of
without changing the overall risk profile.
<Q>: Great. Thanks. That's very helpful.
