Now before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our
executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the factors identified in the
release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain
non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website.
Now let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig A. Menear
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter for both sales and earnings as we continue to
see strength across our business. Sales for the third quarter were $23.2 billion, up 6.1% from last year. Comp sales were
up 5.5% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 in the
third quarter, up 18.5% versus last year.
In the U.S., all three of our divisions posted positive comps in the third quarter, led by our Southern Division. All of
our regions positively comp'd, except one region in the North. In New England, we had a small negative, due primarily
to a state sales tax holiday in fiscal 2015 that did not repeat in 2016. Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian
businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico and Canada reported positive comps in local currency,
marking 52 consecutive quarters and 20 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth respectively.
As Ted will detail, we saw balanced growth from both ticket and transactions. All of our merchandising departments
posted positive comps and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY customers with Pro sales
growing faster than DIY sales in the quarter. Our Pro business continues to be driven by a strong offering of brands that
Pros demand, consistent product innovation, as well as enhanced delivery and credit offerings to help them more
efficiently manage their business.
In the third quarter, we anniversaried the acquisition of Interline and are proud of the team's efforts in the first year. The
Interline integration continues to progress as we work to execute against the business use cases to leverage Interline's
capabilities. We're excited about the opportunity Interline provides us to expand our share of wallet with customers.
We continue to see double-digit sales growth from our online business. This quarter, online sales grew over 17% and
represented 5.6% of overall sales. Over 40% of our online orders are picked up in the store which we view as a positive
sign of our physical stores' continued relevance with our customers. This quarter, we rolled out a complete
homedepot.com redesign. Content was enhanced to display in full screen, optimizing our desktop and tablet displays
for customers.
You'll recall during last year's third quarter, we opened and began shipping from our third direct fulfillment center or
DFC, in the U.S. With this distribution infrastructure in place, we have been better able to serve the needs of our online
customers faster and more directly. We are still sorting the appropriate products to house in our three DFCs, but we've
been able to reduce delivery costs and improve overall customer experience.
We continue to invest in our supply chain transformation by optimizing our network through initiatives like Supply
Chain Sync. This quarter, we began the roll-out of Sync to our Northern Division, and we continue to on-board new
suppliers in the Southern and Western Divisions. As you know, this is a multi-year, multi-phased endeavor, but we are
pleased with our progress thus far.
Changing customer expectations are requiring that we simplify our operations in order to improve productivity, and at
the same time reinvest in the customer experience. Our efforts to drive operational excellence and freight handling in
the stores are doing just that. Reducing both time and footsteps needed to move freight end to end, or from truck to
shelf will enable us to reallocate associate time to enhance the customer experience.

One way we're reinvesting in the customer experience is through initiatives like COM and BODFS. As you will recall,
COM is our new Customer Order Management system that was fully deployed last quarter in all U.S. stores. And
BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store, remains on track to be rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. In the
1,600-plus stores where we have BODFS, our on-time delivery service is now exceeding our target, and we have seen
double-digit increase in the number of deliveries. We are pleased with the positive customer response to this enhanced
delivery option.
Turning to the macro environment, we believe home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation, and
the aging housing stock in the U.S. continue to support growth in our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming
our sales growth, and lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year.
Let me close by thanking our 400,000-plus associates for their hard work, dedication, and commitment to our
customers. I'd like to give a special thanks to all the associates and suppliers who have worked to help the communities
impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. They've worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances,
often in the face of disruption in their own lives caused by these storms. Service to our communities is a core part of the
Home Depot culture and we're very proud of their efforts.
With that, let me turn the call over to Ted.
Edward P. Decker
Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our results in the third quarter. We saw strength
across the store balanced between Pro and DIY customers as well as continued growth in our online business.
All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps led by appliances which had double-digit comps in the
quarter. Lumber, tools, outdoor garden, indoor garden, lighting, décor, and flooring were above the company's average
comp. Plumbing, hardware, building materials, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical and paint were positive, but
below the company average.
We continue to see balanced growth between transactions and average ticket in the quarter. Total comp transactions
increased 2.4% while comp average ticket grew 3.1%. Our average ticket increase was slightly impacted by commodity
price inflation mainly from lumber and building materials.
The total impacted ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 35 basis points. In addition, our
average ticket growth was negatively impacted by approximately 33 basis points primarily due to a weaker Mexican
peso.
Looking at big-ticket sales in the third quarter, transactions over $900 which represent approximately 20% of our U.S.
sales were up 11.3%. Drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, flooring and roofing.
Once again, we saw strong outperformance in the Pro heavy categories as Pro sales grew faster than the company's
average comp. This led to strong comps in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, plywood, pressure-treated
decking and interior doors.
At the same time, we also saw strength with the DIY customer as they undertook various projects around the house.
This project business drove strong comps in special order carpet, tool storage, laminate flooring, and vanities.
Weather remained favorable throughout the quarter and extended the outdoor project selling season. By leveraging
forecasting analytics, strong supplier collaboration and our flexible supply chain, we were able to meet customer
demand throughout the prolonged selling season.
Categories such as lawn mowers, seed planters, fertilizers and soils and mulch posted comps above the company
average. As Craig mentioned our vendor partners' supply chain and internal teams rallied to support our customers
impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. Through strong collaboration, we were able to get
product to our communities in their time of need. We estimate the impact of storm-related sales in the quarter to be

approximately $100 million.
During the quarter, we held our annual Halloween, Harvest and Labor Day events. These events were a huge success
and increased both foot traffic in our stores and volume online. We experienced robust comps in decorative holiday,
appliances and power tools.
Turning to our interconnected business, we made significant changes to our online experiences in the third quarter. We
rolled out an updated HD.com site and redesigned our app, both without interruption.
The update includes an expanded buy box, which now makes it easier for our customers to select their preferred
fulfillment option at checkout, whether that be delivered to home or picked up in store. These changes have already
yielded positive results as we have seen improvements in overall site performance.
Now, let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Product innovation remains a key part of our strategy. Adding to our
broad lineup of professional grade power tools, we are excited to introduce two new breakthroughs. From Milwaukee,
we are launching a nine-amp-hour lithium battery. This battery pack delivers up to five times the run-time, 35% more
power and runs 60% cooler than standard lithium battery packs, saving customers valuable time and money. The new
battery is fully compatible with more than 100 Milwaukee M18 tools and provides the next big step towards complete
[indiscernible] (12:22) replacement. This new and advanced battery is a big box exclusive to the Home Depot.
For Makita, we're excited to announce the new Subcompact Drill and Impact Driver. These revolutionary new tools are
the smallest Pro tools in the market delivering 18-volt power. The electronically controlled brushless motor in these
products enables them to run cooler and more efficiently, while at the same time matching the torque and RPMs needed
to meet the demands of the pro customer. These products are another big box exclusive to the Home Depot.
The winter season and cooler temperatures are rapidly approaching, and we have a great lineup of excellent values and
special buys for our customers during our Black Friday, holiday and gift center events.
One product to look for this holiday season is the exciting new Star Shower Motion Laser Light. This new and
improved laser light projector not only projects thousands of green and red stars for a festive display in the front of the
home, but it also turns into a motion laser light show at the press of a button. This product is a channel exclusive to the
Home Depot.
Our upcoming events, new product launches and outstanding execution by our associates will help drive a great holiday
season.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol B. Tomé
Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $23.2 billion, a 6.1% increase from last year
driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, foreign currency
rates, primarily a weaker Mexican peso, negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $76 million, or
0.35%.
Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.8% in
August, 6.5% in September and 6.1% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.9% for the quarter with
positive comps of 4.2% in August, 6.9% in September and 6.5% in October.
One last comment on comps. While we are on a path to fully integrate Interline Brands, we aren't at a point where it
makes sense to include its results in our comps and operational sales metrics. When the business becomes more
integrated, we will include Interline's results in our operational metrics.
Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 6 basis points from last year. The change in
our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors. First, as expected, we had 24 basis points of gross

margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our
supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity. And finally, we had 17 basis points of gross margin expansion
arising from a change in the mix of products sold and improvement in inventory shrinkage. For fiscal 2016, we
continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015.
In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 62 basis points to 20.4%. In the quarter, we
had some expenses that we did not plan for, including $23 million of legal expenses related to our 2014 data breach,
and approximately $15 million of storm-related cleanup expenses. Even with this unplanned expense pressure, we
delivered total expenses under our plan. For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 32% of our
fiscal 2016 sales growth rate.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, an increase of 68 basis points from last year. Interest and other
expense for the third quarter was $236 million, down $4 million from last year. In the third quarter, our effective tax
rate was 36.2% compared to 37.1% last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be
approximately 36.7%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.60, an increase of 18.5% from last
year.
Now, turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $13.2 billion, up $746
million from last year. Inventory turns were five times, flat with the third quarter of last year. Year-over-year, accounts
payable grew slightly faster than inventory, increasing by $818 million to $8.1 billion.
In the third quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or approximately 16.4 million shares of outstanding stock, bringing our
year-to-date share repurchases to approximately $4.6 billion. Additionally, during the quarter, we took advantage of an
attractive interest rate environment and raised $2 billion of incremental long-term debt, including a $1 billion tranche
with a record-setting 40-year maturity carrying a coupon of 3.5%.
We will use the proceeds of this debt issuance to repurchase outstanding shares, bringing our targeted fiscal 2016 share
repurchases to $7 billion. Accordingly, we expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding shares in the
fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four
quarters, return on invested capital was 29.1%, 280 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
Moving to our guidance, we remain encouraged by the strength of our core business. Our outlook for the remainder of
the year reflects modest GDP growth, continued benefit from U.S. housing markets and candidly some market share
gains. While we have tough fourth quarter comparisons, as Ted described, we plan for them. Today, we are reaffirming
our sales growth guidance.
For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3%, with comps of approximately 4.9%. Note that our
sales forecast assumes foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal third quarter.
For earnings per share, we've tightened up our tax provision and outstanding share forecast and are lifting our guidance.
We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.9% to $6.33.
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Catherine, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Craig, the key question here is how do you comp the comp in the fourth quarter and the
first quarter, given a very cooperative weather conditions that you saw last year? I know you briefly touched on that,

but maybe you can provide a little bit more detail? Plus, what are you looking for to ensure that you don't misread the
state of the cycle and either respond too quickly or too slowly to potentially changing market conditions?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So on how do we comp the comp? As I recall, this is the conversation we had going into
fiscal 2016, coming out of last year. Quite honestly, I mean that's the hard work that the team does immediately
following the performance that we had last year in the fourth quarter. We are up against big numbers. U.S. comp in the
fourth quarter last year was 8.9%, but that's really the work the team started doing immediately following the close of
that quarter.
And so we feel confident in the programs that the merchant teams have laid out, the support with the supply chain
teams and then of course, our store associates taking those programs and driving them. Quite honestly, that's our job
and that's what we need to do.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And if I could just jump in, it's Carol here, so we're in the middle of November and we are on
track to deliver the sales that we just guided to.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: And then in terms of what we look at, so that we don't miss anything, we've shared in the past
I think that we're constantly watching ticket and transaction. And when you step away from the downturn in the
mid-2000s, the previous downturn was 2001, and we saw a decline in average ticket. That was a little bit of a leading
indicator. Now, you have to be careful, because ticket can be affected by things like weather.
So when you have big-ticket sales, for example, in the first and second quarter on things like tractors, weather can
impact that. So we do watch ticket carefully. We balance that with transactions. What we're seeing in the business right
now we like a lot, we see a nice balance between ticket and transactions.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And in fact, transactions accelerated through the quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Throughout the quarter?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And, Carol, you mentioned that you anticipate some share gains in the fourth quarter,
historically you really haven't factored your share gains into your longer term outlook. What's changing now that's
giving you the confidence to put that in there whereas you [ph] had an impact (23:02)?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, as we look at the environment, we see that there are share donors in certain categories.
Ted called out that appliances was a double-digit comp for us in the third quarter, it contributed 50 basis points of our
overall growth in the quarter as for the year. And so as we look to the fourth quarter, it's always a big appliance selling
season and we would expect to continue to grow appliances in the fourth quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: And Michael, we have obviously made a lot of investments over the past few years to make
sure we're positioned to be able to capture that.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. And if I could add one last one on the SG&A, recognizing that you have one-time
item quarter in, quarter out, good guys and not so good guys yet the SG&A has been growing 2% to 4% after being up
at a much more moderate pace, I'm talking on a per square foot basis. So are we just at a point where the business
requires a little bit more investment, because you've had so many years of strong comp and so the flow-through might
not be as strong moving forward?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, if I could take you back to the beginning of the year, we've said that our expenses would
grow at 40% of our sales growth rate. We are announcing that our expenses this year will grow at 32% of our sales
growth rate. And what that means, year-to-date our expenses have grown at 37.5% of our sales growth rate, so the
fourth quarter you should expect a lot of leverage on the SG&A line, principally, because we have year-over-year

expense items that we will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year.
Last year, we had outperformance of bonus, we had some store cleanup costs, those items will not repeat in the fourth
quarter of this year, so expect a good flow-through.
Longer term as we talked about and we talked about this at the beginning of the year, because of items like rising
people costs and we're not alone, all companies have faced this rising people costs, over the long-term we would expect
our expenses to grow at 50% of our sales growth rate and we're not providing guidance for 2017 today, but you would
expect next year for us to come back and tell you it should be more in the 50% area.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Excellent. Thank you so much.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
Operator
And we'll now hear from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: I just wanted to follow-up on the question about the cycle and the outlook for demand in the
category. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of bigger ticket discretionary projects. Are you seeing
any sort of change in the types of projects consumers or Pros are focused on? May be anything that would indicate that
we're maybe heading into a different part of the cycle?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: When you look at the larger ticket sales, it's coming we believe from multiple areas, it's
coming from the strength in the Pro business, it's from our services business, it's coming from things like the appliance
sales growth. So it's a broad aspect of drivers behind the ticket. And when you look at the third quarter, actually our
transactions over $900 was the largest quarter growth of the year.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And I think it's important to just step back and look at where we are in terms of the cycle and
focus on home price appreciation, because that's a big driver of our business.
Since 2011, homeowners sustained a 95% increase in their home equity. That's come about because of rising prices as
well as if you have a mortgage, you've been making mortgage payments since 2011. So homeowners really do view
their home as an investment and not an expense.
So the question is, okay, great, well, what does it mean for 2017 and beyond? Well, we see home prices have recovered
in certain parts of the country, there are other parts of the country where we are still double-digit down from peak;
those areas include Chicago and Atlanta, so in terms of where we are for the cycle, you can't look at the averages,
because the averages will kill you. You have to look at the market. So when you look at the market, we see real
opportunity for continued improvement.
There's a really interesting statistics that comes out of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, and they call it the
leading indicator of remodeling activity, and this leading indicator of remodeling activity suggests continued growth
throughout the fourth quarter, throughout 2017. They don't produce the report past 2017, but their work suggests we
will continue to grow.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe a good follow-up here would be, you guys have rolled
out a couple key offerings to better serve the Pro, including credit and advanced delivery options. I know it's very early,
but I mean, do you think that's playing a role in driving big-ticket and the strength we saw this quarter? And do you
think these options are driving in maybe a different customer or changing behavior within the store?

<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, as you said, we're still in the process of rolling out. It's early days. We have not
completed the roll-out of BODFS, our Buy Online Deliver From Store, yet we're now up to about 1,600 stores where
we've launched the program. As I mentioned in my comments, we've seen double-digit growth in deliveries. So
certainly, we think that that is beginning to have a positive impact and making it easier for our Pro customers as well as
our DIY customers to engage and shop with The Home Depot.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: On the credit side, it's important to note that we have a little over 900,000 Pros that hold a
private label credit card with us. We've converted over 20% of those Pros onto our new value prop, and for those who
have converted, 64% of those are activating the new value prop. So we see growth in those accounts. And as we
continue to convert and add new Pros into the program, we expect this to be a top line benefit. Today, it's growing, it's
not materially impacting the top line, but it's growing and we expect that to continue to grow over time.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: That's great color. Thanks very much.

<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.

related to storms -- is that hurricane and flooding combined? And just related to the hurricane, can you talk about how
much the hurricane lifted the month of October in the U.S.?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: The number is both in total. Candidly, the flooding has been an impact throughout the entire
quarter...
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: ...and a larger driver.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It was the biggest part of that $100 million.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Oh, interesting. So the hurricane lift to October is -- actually sounds like it was
certainly – if you're talking about 50 basis points for the quarter and most of that being related to flooding, then maybe
50, 70 basis points of lift to the month for October is simply from the hurricane?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Not that much.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Just the timing of the hurricane and where it hit, it's not that much. We saw significant
[inaudible] (30:19) coming out of the flooding. In fact, I think you know we had to shut down a store. We lost a store.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Part of those store-related expenses I called out on the SG&A line is because we had to
basically liquidate the inventory, clean up the store, and get it back open, which we did do, which is very exciting for
us.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Yeah, the flooding happened at the end of Q2, so the flooding impact was the entire quarter
and was a much bigger impact. Obviously the hurricane was in October.

<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Understood. And then one of the questions that we're getting is how you're
thinking about or what's implied in the fourth quarter related to annual guidance. I think some the more skeptical
investors out there are saying, hey, look, Home Depot is sort of implying EPS and comps below where the Street is
sitting for the fourth quarter. So can you talk about how you thought about approaching the guidance on the year? And
then how you thought about addressing those questions to investors?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I think the easiest way to think about this is on a two-year stack basis. So the implied comp for
the fourth quarter is a little over 3%. If you look at the two-year stack for the first half of 2016, the two-year stack comp
is 10.6%. If you look at the two-year stack comp for Q3, it's 10.6%. If you look then at the forecasted two-year stack
comp for Q4, it's over 10%. So skepticism abounds, but we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we give based
on these two-year stack.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Perfect. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Thanks, guys – sorry about that. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to poke a
little bit more about – thinking about the environment going forward. Obviously, we had a big election and the market's
taken off. But as we think about your business, obviously, Pro is growing pretty fast, but we have SG&A maybe
growing about 50% of sales, I think is what's been said. So as we kind of think of the construct of 2017 and beyond,
and knowing that there's a lot of dry powder in the housing market, how do you guys think about your growth rate as
we move out of the fourth quarter, which has got a lot of noise and go into 2017 and 2018, do you think we are at the
end of the cycle or could this cycle be a lot different?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, first comment I'd make, obviously we're not prepared to talk about 2017. We'll do
that on our next call. But, what I would say is, if you look at the drivers of growth, we don't see significant change in
the drivers of growth. We've had foundational GDP growth, we've had in housing home value appreciation, housing
turnover, new household formation, and then layer on top of that, 65% of the housing stock in the U.S. is now in excess
of 30 years old.
All of those are drivers of business for us, there's nothing that would indicate that we see that those would change, and
as Carol said, there's varying degrees of recovery amongst different parts of the country. So we don't see anything on
the horizon at this stage that would say anything should change in terms of the growth drivers in our business.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And if you recall the Investor Conference we had in December of last year we set forth a sales
target of $101 billion and operating margin target of 14.5% by 2018. As we sit here today nothing has taken us off of
that target.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: I guess I was even thinking the more bullish side, I mean, could we – the recovery was
called as a zombie economy growth session. We've had a lot of different words we've used for it. Is it conceivable as
you look at your business over the last three or four years that it's been obviously very good, but a better environment
and better macro environment could drive growth higher?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And have you guys thought about that?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, it's possible, but we're focused on the numbers that Carol just shared that we laid out
in our Investor Conference. That's roughly $12 billion plus worth of growth between now and 2018 from where we
started this year and that's the equivalent of opening 357 new Home Depot stores, which we won't do. So that's no
small hill and we're focused on achieving those numbers.

<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And then just one – thank you for that. And just one clarification was the Pro growth
sequentially, is it sequentially speeding up, and then I'll yield? Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: The Pro growth was higher than the DIY growth in the third quarter, but the sequential
comment had to do with transactions...

And we'll go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning, Simeon.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Following up on some commentary, Craig, you were making about big-ticket, so we
know it was very strong, and I think you called out appliances, flooring and roofing, and that you always try to gauge
the balance of it. I guess for those categories to have been strong in Q3, how should we gauge the sustainability of
those? I mean appliances seems to be a share gaining category, it's been good for a while. It's probably a big fourth
quarter category. Is flooring and roofing more weather dependent or is that more seasonal or is it lasting?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, roofing obviously can be seasonal depending on what happens. If you get ice and snow
you're not really repairing – you might repair, but you won't replace a roof. Flooring is less seasonal overall.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then as a follow-up I guess to thinking about I think, Carol, you talked about
looking at individual markets that there is still some room to go. Can you distill a little further, you gave us a
geographic color by market, can you talk about any performance. I don't know if it's oil markets, rural markets, any
disparities on a regional level sort of beneath the geographic data that you've provided is better or worse that you could
gauge the overall environment with?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, in certain geographies like Texas where you may say, how are the sales performing there?
We see double-digit comps in parts of Texas, so Texas is doing very well. I will tell you our stores in North Dakota are
negative comping. Two stores in North Dakota, so that's not a surprise to us. It doesn't matter to the overall company,
but that's not a surprise. But on balance, as Craig pointed out, we saw got good growth across the country with
opportunities for more growth.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: And the way you look at the pent-up demand you've talked – you've shown us categories
that have not reached a full potential. Do you look at your markets that way? Can you share any color about the number
of our markets where we don't think either the housing market or our business has gotten back to let's say some
normalized demand level or has potential to keep going?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah, we do look at it that way, and as we look [inaudible] (37:56) markets that have not fully
recovered.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. We'll now hear from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning to you. First question should be a fairly simple one, you
gave us the comp for the big-ticket bucket, can you give us the small-ticket, and then we can solve for the rest of the
business please?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: The under 50 Matt, was a 1.6% comp.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. Understood. And then secondly, you talked about share gains, you spoke about
particularly categories like appliances which are more DIY-focused. Can you give us a sense of the pace of share gains
that you're seeing in Pro, and perhaps on the categories that might be standing out from the perspective, and your sense
I guess as a part of that as to how the Pro market looks today from a growth perspective relative to DIY?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: I would say that the Pro is very strong, one thing we saw this quarter is we've always talked
about the high-spend Pro and low-spend Pro, the low-spend Pro comp was on par with the high-spend Pro. So that's
nice to see not only geographical breadth, but the high and low-spend Pro of our each comping at that stronger rate than
consumer.
And as we look across departments, virtually every department had higher Pro spend comp than consumer. So the Pro
is strong across the business. We continue to be extremely pleased with our lumber building material business, our tool
business in particular, just continues to accelerate and we're taking meaningful share in the tools business.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: And presumably we can tie to some degree that the migration to Pro with the overall strong
performance of the bigger ticket baskets for you?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Certainly.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Okay. Thank you so much for that detail. I appreciate it.

We'll continue on to Dan Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Thanks. Two questions first on August stood out as sort of a softer month was there
anything in particular that you would highlight there?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: It was an extremely warm month.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Okay. And then in the appliance business it looked like the industry as well, as you
were a little bit more aggressive year-over-year I suspect that maybe in part to what you highlighted earlier in terms of
wanting to take share, but I was curious what your feelings were about the health of the appliance industry given what
we've heard from vendors and what you see in your own business? In other words is it taking higher promotions to
drive that comp?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No, our promotional cadence is almost identical to last year. And we see the strength in our
portfolio across all of our brands and you know very, very strong across the board.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: And then lastly on holiday, the holiday business, every year that business seems to get
bigger and I was just curious how you've ordered for this year? Is it up – are orders up double-digit? What are you

expecting in terms of contribution to the fourth quarter?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, it's a big business and a growing business, it's still for the quarter, not a determinative
business for us but yes, we bought into that, that's part of our growth in inventory, and we're expecting another great
holiday season. I'd say also on the back of the Halloween and harvest we bought into that as well this past year, we're
extremely pleased with the performance of that deco holiday segment and looking forward to an equally strong
Christmas period as well.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
And Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank has our next question.
<Q - Mike Baker>: Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the Pro and can you estimate for us what you think your
share of the Pro business is compared to your share of DIY and eventually what do you think you could gain in terms
of share for the Pro business?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: So share around the Pro is a little bit elusive but again we try to triangulate on the number. I
think what we've looked at is we're playing now in a $550 billion market with the addition of the MRO for hospitality,
institutional and multifamily. We think total share for The Home Depot plays somewhere in the 15% range, inclusive
of all Pro and DIY and services. And we believe that our DIY share is sitting somewhere in the neighborhood of 27%
to 28%.
<Q - Mike Baker>: Okay. And so we back into Pro being about 10%, given the penetration of EBITDA. Is that about
right?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Give or take – 10% or 12%, give or take. Yes.
<Q - Mike Baker>: Okay. Thank you. And then couple other follow-ups. Promotional cadence; you said you were
relatively similar, but what have you seen from any of your competitors? And particularly on appliances, one of the big
vendors had pretty strong appliance unit but very low dollars because of mix and pricing. So wondering if you're seeing
any of your competitors being irrational because that's something that I think has impacted you guys in the past when
some competitors got a little irrational with appliances?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, I would say appliances included, but our entire Q4 cadence is identical. I can't think of
anything that were meaningfully different from Q4 of last year. I would say broadly across the business in portfolio and
categories, we are focused on offering an everyday low price to our Pro and consumer customers.
<Q - Mike Baker>: Right. And so that's your offering. You're not seeing anything irrational from competitors, I guess
is the question.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Now I mean, yeah, look. Time to time, folks run promotions. They try to drive their
business. That's just the nature of the business these days. And we see that. We see that with the competition, but we're
going to work hard to try to remain focused on our everyday value for customer.
<Q - Mike Baker>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.

<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just – Carol, one question on the inventory side. I think
obviously last quarter, you mentioned some error in the algorithm and just curious if you could update us there as far as
where you guys are on the in-stock?. And then more broadly just how you're thinking about inventory management
now and in the future. You've heard a lot of suppliers talk about inventory adjustments of big customers and curious if
you feel that to be somewhat tied to the – just the end market of point-of-sale or if that's more strategy on the
distribution side?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, I'll talk about some of the inventory findings. First, our in-stock rates are a tick higher
than they were year-on-year. That's exactly where we want them to be. We bought in for the season so our inventory is
healthy. We are ready for the season. The quality of inventory has never been better. If I look at clearance, inactive,
E-velocity we're at the lowest levels in the 21 years that I've been here. So never better in terms of quality. And in terms
of where we think the inventory may go, we've got a lot of initiatives underway in the supply chain world. And maybe
Mark Holifield would comment on Supply Chain Sync and so on and so forth.
<A - Mark Holifield>: Yes. We're pleased with the results of Supply Chain Sync; certainly pleased right now with the
state of our inventory; as Carol outlined, a tick higher than last year; well prepared for Q4. And we've increased our
JLQs for our Pro customers a bit.
In terms of Sync, we continue to roll that out. The way to think about that, our RDC network handles about half of our
cost of goods sold. We're live in two-thirds of our RDCs at this point with about two-thirds of the COGS, the cost of
goods sold, dollar volume through there. We will be rolling to the north RDCs here as we go through the next several
months, and that will complete the rollout in terms of the RDCs. And then we'll continue to roll to other vendors as we
continue.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: I think the most important thing as it relates to inventory -- obviously, we look for
productivity but first and foremost is we're looking to continually improve our overall in-stock position, and be able to
take care of the customers' needs and the quantities they need.
<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: Okay. And then second question just as it relates to both Canada and Mexico, I guess
kind of different impacts going on, but hoping you can maybe speak to the fundamental backdrop in Canada with
housing market looking a little bit weaker there. Just what you're seeing as far as your performance, whether that's
share gain or maybe we shouldn't be worried about some of the housing metrics. And then in Mexico under the new
administration, any thoughts as how it could impact your business with policy or immigration reform, et cetera?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, let me start with Mexico. I mean obviously, there have been changes in Mexico over
the years. We have been able to drive an unbelievable performance in Mexico through all those changes, and we
continue to see us doing that. We're very pleased with our business in Mexico. The team has done a phenomenal job
down there of growing that business and positioning us as the largest home improvement retailer in Mexico.
As it relates to Canada, clearly, what you've seen in Canada or what we've experienced is in the Province of Alberta,
into Saskatchewan, where more dependent upon energy. Clearly we've seen pressure there that we haven't seen in the
balance of the country. But the team has worked hard to offset that pressure and grow the business overall. And we're
very pleased with our business in Canada, and the team has done an amazing job to offset that pressure in the West.
<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: Thank you, guys. Good luck.

<Q - Brian Nagel>: First question, and this, I know this is really big picture and early, but with the change in
administration here in the United States, any initial thoughts as to how you're thinking at Home Depot, how the shifting
political landscape could impact your company?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, our thoughts are, our job is to stay focused on our customer, to make sure that we're
driving the most convenient, interconnected experience, leveraging all the asset base that we have, and that we're
driving value for our customers through great values and through great innovation. That is our sole focus. It's what
we're all about. It's what we need to stay in tune with so that we stay relevant to our customers.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Okay. I appreciate that. Then secondly, on the – I know there's been other questions on appliances
as well, but my take or my question here is it seems as though, just watching a wide number – or a large number of
retailers, that more and more chains of various sizes are pushing into this business. So with that, I guess I'm asking are
you seeing increased competition from other retailers push into the business? And if so, what form has that taken? And
have you had to change or are you considering changing how you go to market in appliances as a result of that?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, just yes, there are obviously more folks jumping into this business. But again, as Ted
described, we have a very strong appliance business. We're gaining share in the category. We like our model.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: And we've not seen an impact from new entrants, and we don't envision any change to our
go-to-market strategy on appliances.

And Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Carol, I wanted to go back to one of your earlier comments regarding market by market
differences. Yes, we know that some markets haven't necessarily recovered from a home price perspective, but we
actually have seen pretty rapid home price appreciation in other markets. And at least in pockets, we're starting to hear
about some pricing pressure in some of those. So I guess the question is, are there some high, let's call it, home
appreciation markets where you're starting to see any slowing in big-ticket sales?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah, so I actually looked at that this morning. I went to the San Francisco Bay area and I went
to Seattle because those are two markets where you're seeing real home price appreciation and I wanted to see, are we
seeing a slowdown in big-ticket or anything that would cause us to be concerned, and we don't see anything at this
point.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Got you. Okay. And then just quickly shifting to gross margin. I know you previously talked
about gross margin expansion in the back half of this year. Maybe I just had the cadence a bit wrong, but I guess I
would've expected some modest expansion in 3Q. Was there anything else that may have impacted the gross margin
that you didn't already cite? And has your outlook for 4Q changed at all?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: No. We were very pleased with our gross margin performance in the third quarter. We
expanded by six basis points. And based on the guidance I've given you, you should expect similar expansion in the
fourth quarter.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Roger that. All right. Thanks, guys.

Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities, please go ahead.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is around trade up and trade down. Have you
guys seen any trends in consumers trading up to more expensive products within a line or trading down for that matter?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: That's something we watch and have given color on previously, and we see a similar trend
where our comps are strong across the value line with higher comps in the higher price point goods. And we think that
is a lot driven by innovation and just the fabulous product that we're bringing to market.
<A - Mark Holifield>: Yeah, if you think about the two products in power tools that Ted called out in his comments,
those are unbelievable innovations that clearly help drive ticket within the category and expansion of benefits for the
customer.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Got it. And in terms of the projects that consumers are doing, are we seeing bigger tickets
associated with those projects as they prefer more expensive items to complete them?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You can look at our services business and our services business up year-on-year. We exited a
few businesses at the end of last year if you ignore the businesses that we exited, our services business, which has the
average ticket north of $1,000 grew faster than the company average in the third quarter.

Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. Two questions. One is just a follow up, Carol, on Interline and that last comment. So if we
look at Interline could you give us the impact on SG&A in the quarter and also just how that business is going,
presumably it's also growing faster than the company average [indiscernible] (54:33)?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Interline contributed $300 million of growth year-on-year. The gross margin – obviously it
impacted the gross margin and in terms of EPS we generated a couple pennies of EPS off of Interline in the quarter.
<Q - Greg Melich>: What did it do to SG&A?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It put pressure within the overall guidance that we gave.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Okay. So we'll back into that and EPS was slightly accretive?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes. About $0.02.
<Q - Greg Melich>: $0.02. And then my real question sort of ties back to SG&A, I think you mentioned given rising
wage pressures and other costs that we should go forward thinking about 50% growth of sales into 2017, perhaps
beyond. How should we think of that, is it simply if sales are growing 5% that we should assume SG&A dollars grow
2.5% or is there like a baseline that it grows and then it's 50% of a comp above that? Or am I thinking about it too
much?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You're thinking about it too much. Because our largest – our largest expense is payroll and we
have an activity-based model. So we have so much opportunity to adjust to the payroll staffing [indiscernible] (55:48)
side of our stores, so just use 50%, will it be perfect? No, but it's good enough for modeling purposes.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Okay. So that's more of letting us know that the fourth quarter where SG&A really isn't going to
grow.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Right.
<Q - Greg Melich>: As a comparison issue, we shouldn't view that as a new trend?

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Exactly.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Got it. And then last one if I can sneak one in, the Pro side of the business if we were to
disaggregate it and think about the buckets that were driving it, I think in the beginning Craig you mentioned a few
different things, the new credit offer was less, but delivery was focused could you give us any highlights there like
Carol you did on the credit as to how the delivery uptake is doing and how you see the customer changing as they do
that?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Again, we're now rolled out with a new delivery program in about 1,600 stores. And again,
we've seen double-digit growth in deliveries. Now not all of that is incremental. We think roughly 50% of that is
incremental sales growth, but clearly some customers are taking up on the offer that might have picked it up before as
well, and we anticipated that that would happen.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. And how many of your Pros do you think have used it?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: That I don't know.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Okay. Thanks. Good luck.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<A - Diane Dayhoff>: We have time for one more question, Catherine.
Operator
Yes, ma'am. We'll go to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Peter Jacob Keith>: Hey. Thanks everyone. Great quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<Q - Peter Jacob Keith>: Was curious on the recent step up in mortgage rates the last couple of days, if you have any
thought on how that may or may not impact your business and maybe even making some comparisons back to 2013
when we saw another sharp rate increase?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So we look at the affordability index which is over 150% that's good news, and then we went
back and looked at, okay, historical percentages of household income used for mortgage payment. If you look at the
years 1995 through 2000, 22% of homeowners' income was used for their mortgage payment. It's down now to about
14%. Interest rates could go up to 7% and no one is suggesting that will happen, but interest rates could go up to 7%
and we would be back to about 22% of household income used for mortgage payment. So we've got a long way to go
before there's any impact we think to our business from rising interest rates.
<Q - Peter Jacob Keith>: Okay. That's interesting. Thank you. And maybe last for me it's interesting that mix was a
gross margin positive. I guess we're not used to seeing that in your business. Could you talk about what happened there
and is that something that we might see going forward?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, we had higher penetration of certain categories that had higher margins not because our
retails went up, but because we took cost out. I think we've talked to you in the past that we've stood up a cost out team
that works with our merchants and we really do try to drive productivity in our cost of goods sold. So it was that
dynamic of a higher penetration in categories with cost out that really gave us our margin expansion.
<Q - Peter Jacob Keith>: Okay. Thanks a lot, and good luck in the fourth quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.
