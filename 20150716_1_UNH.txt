Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning and thank you for joining us to review UnitedHealth Group's second quarter results. Our second quarter
and first half were once again strong across our business portfolio, continuing the performance consistency and growth
momentum that have been advancing since the second
half of 2014. The market sees real value in a simpler, more modern and helpful consumer experience, well-informed
consumer and physician engagement, access to quality care, practical innovation, and fair pricing.
With the expected closing of the Catamaran transaction and improved momentum in our base business, we now expect
2015 revenues to be $154 billion; earnings to be in the range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share, and cash flows from
operations to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
Second quarter revenues grew 11.3% year-over-year to $36.3 billion. After-tax net margins improved 10 basis points
and net earnings grew 15% year-over-year to $1.64 per share. Second quarter cash flows from operations also grew
15% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and brought first half 2015 operating cash flows to $3.4 billion, or 114% of net
income and this compares to 97% through the midpoint of last year.
Second quarter earnings were driven by both consistent broad-based growth at UnitedHealthcare and continued strong
growth and an improving margin performance from Optum. We are positioned well for the second half of 2015 and
continue to forecast UnitedHealth Group's earnings per share growth will accelerate in 2016.
I will ask Larry Renfro to lead off today with a review of Optum and then Dave Wichmann will pick up with
UnitedHealthcare and some UnitedHealth Group Enterprise themes. Larry?
Larry C. Renfro
Thanks, Steve. Optum is formally on track to achieve significant growth and performance targets for both 2015 and
2016. Second quarter results were strong across the board and position us well once again for a strong finish in the
second half of the year. Optum revenues grew 16% in the second quarter. Optum's overall operating margin of 6.4%
improved 20 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points from the first quarter with all businesses improving their
margins sequentially. This higher overall margin, on a growing revenue base, drove 19% growth in Optum's earnings
from operations this quarter.
Through the first half of the year, Optum earned 42% of its full-year operating earnings target, even while absorbing
$42 million in Catamaran merger cost in the first quarter. Given normal seasonality, Optum is well on track to achieve
its full-year plan.
As we have shared before, Optum is focused on opportunities to dramatically elevate value for customers in five large
growth markets: clinical care, pharmacy care services, technology solutions, and government services, with
international versions of these being the fifth opportunity.
In pharmacy care services, there is a clear market need for a more integrated patient-centered cost-sensitive offering.
We are committed to creating a next-generation pharmacy care services company. The addition of Catamaran
accelerates our efforts significantly. Together, we believe we will better serve people through a comprehensive
whole-person approach that integrates data, information, analytics, and clinical care insight to support care treatments
and compliance rather than just filling prescriptions.
This is doubly true in the coming era of specialty drugs. We will bring better and more consistent overall quality and
lower cost for consumers. This approach enhances the differentiated value OptumRX offers customers beyond the
benefits of our combined purchasing of over 1 billion scripts per year. We expect the merger to close within the next
two weeks. So we will be advancing this effort over the balance of this year, slightly ahead of schedule.
Turning to the technology solutions market, care providers are strongly embracing Optum360 offerings. They can
leverage our technology infrastructure and full portfolio of solutions for modern, performance-based care delivery

across the full range of care settings, including receiving comprehensive revenue management services and
accompanying operating analytics, computer-assisted coding, clinical documentation, ICD-10 compliance, and
population health management.
These capabilities, packaged as a comprehensive solution, are designed to optimize the financial and service
performance of the care provider customers we serve and help them transition to perform exceptionally well under
performance-based and value-based delivery arrangements.
Optum360 has been one of the contributors to the overall growth in OptumInsight revenues, which grew 13% this past
quarter and contributed to growth in contract backlog of more than 35% externally, reaching a record $9.8 billion in
total at June 30. And we are seeing accelerating growth potential going forward as Optum's overall sales pipeline of
potential contract awards has grown to $14 billion, an increase of about 30% year-over-year, in part due to significant
proposals in the Optum360 markets.
OptumCare, our local care delivery business, helped drive 33% growth in OptumHealth revenues this quarter. We offer
physicians a unique, strong and stable professional practice opportunity. We can support and equip them to do what
they most clearly want, to practice medicine, rather than administer a complex business. We have invested in modern
technology with unique analytics and process tools to create service responsiveness for patients well beyond what
standalone clinics deliver today. And OptumCare offers compelling value to payers through risk-sharing capabilities
that help them offer affordable health benefit products.
The stability and growth in our patient base and payer relationships reflect the value our physicians provide. As this
business matures, we expect to expand operating margins, while delivering strong, consistent revenue growth.
This past quarter, MedExpress joined OptumCare. With nearly 150 free-standing neighborhood care centers in 16 local
markets, MedExpress can offer as much as 90% of the care typically delivered in a hospital emergency room at about
90% lower cost. We are committed to growing as a leading provider of ambulatory care services, recognizing this
capability will be increasingly valuable to the consumer and healthcare system overall.
We offer these few examples to help illustrate Optum's diversity and commitment to delivering remarkable value for
patients and customers. In each case, these examples are part of enduring relationships we're building with people, who
are seeking sophisticated, trusted partners to help them address both the pressures and the opportunities across the
whole health system. More than selling any one product, serving these client relationships well will be critical as
Optum works to achieve its ambitious goals.
Now, let me turn it over to Dave.
David Scott Wichmann
Thank you, Larry. Starting first with UnitedHealthcare, second quarter revenues grew a strong 10% organically to
$33.1 billion, while operating margins were steady at 6.1%. The UnitedHealth Group consolidated medical care ratio
improved 20 basis points year-over-year; and throughout the first half, medical costs were well-controlled. The
year-over-year decrease in the care ratio occurred despite the growth of about 1.3 million people in Medicaid, Medicare
Advantage and public exchanges, all higher-care-ratio businesses.
The 2015 commercial medical cost trend outlook continues to be biased towards the lower portion of our 5.5% to 6.5%
full-year forecast, and we continue to expect a full-year consolidated care ratio of 80.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points.
Steady growth and discipline around care management and operating costs drove 11% operating earnings growth at
UnitedHealthcare in the quarter.
The core story for UnitedHealthcare continues to be one of distinctive organic gains in overall market share and
above-market revenue growth, along with continued emphasis on serving local market needs. We project domestic
growth of 1.4 million people in 2015, bringing us to organic growth of nearly 10 million more people served in the
United States in the past six years.

While this has been among the strongest organic growth periods we have experienced, we see continued growth
potential going forward. We believe there are opportunities to serve substantially higher numbers of people to deliver
further value and build equity with consumers and physicians in the benefits market. These opportunities stem from
delivering practical innovations at fair price points and executing consistently in their local markets for the millions of
people we serve.
Our newest products increasingly use configured networks that improve care quality and total costs and embed
complementary services to further strengthen value to the consumer. Our combination of informatics and dedicated
local market clinical staff help us find people and engage them in the healthcare system to get the care they need at the
right location, at the right time. Consistently getting all this right drives consumer trust and growth follows in an
expanding market of more than 300 million people in the United States alone.
Let me flag a few representative examples: we are bridging the direct link between consumer engagement and lower
per-member cost trend and let the employers help further engaging consumers in their own health and wellness. This
includes our product development efforts like Rally in cutting-edge areas like incentives, gamification, missions and
social networks. Engaging people on their own care informs them as real consumers and translates into better care,
better care resource use and lower costs.
In July, we released the next evolution of our diabetes prevention and weight management program called Real Appeal,
which merges proven science and diabetes prevention with motivational multi-media weight and lifestyle management
programs to reduce the onset of diabetes, reduce obesity, and improve overall health and metabolic state. Real Appeal
is the first digital extension of Rally, both of which use live coaches and other motivational methods to achieve superior
engagement, quality outcomes and economic results.
Similarly, we are using technology and data behind the scenes to advance the fundamentals of service. Our approach
predicts and prioritizes the needs of inbound inquiries and connects the consumer through whatever communications
channel they choose with clinical, wellness, or administrative personnel based upon their predictive need, making the
service experience simpler, better and more complete for them and more efficient for us.
We approach Medicaid in the context of the broader array of social services people need and States must address in
support of better healthcare. We believe we can increase value for our state customers and our Medicaid members by
helping connect people with our growing network of local market social services like transportation, housing and
nutrition.
On the physician side, 465,000 physicians nationwide have signed up to use our secure, cloud-based workspace called
Link. Link enables doctors and their office staff to transact routine business with multiple payers more efficiently than
they could ever do through traditional, widely-used channels like portals, faxes, and phones. We are furthering that
offering to support practice performance, risk arrangements and referrals through the deployment of tools for search
and price transparency, referrals and online scheduling. And we're just getting started. Think of Link as the end-to-end
dashboard for managing all critical elements of an ambulatory practice, fully integrated with the physician's practice
management system.
Under benefit innovation, we continue to organize our networks around specific local market products, expanding
value-based purchasing in our medical network and next-generation patient incentives to help them get the right care
and make the right decisions. This full alignment from the consumer through the care provider consistently delivers the
highest value.
While modern technology positions us to target and engage people, it is our local people who close the circle. We have
nurses who are performing 1 million clinical visits annually in seniors' homes, nurses and case managers in local
hospitals working alongside hospital staff, community health workers assisting Medicaid recipients
neighborhood-by-neighborhood, and physician office staff assistants helping document physician care quality for
Medicare. Each one of these professionals puts a human face on UnitedHealthcare with every interaction they have at
the local level, improving the quality of healthcare and reducing its costs. We believe no one else delivers such a total
package nationally.

Looking forward, we continue to develop and more deeply integrate our capabilities. We believe UnitedHealthcare will
continue to grow at a market differentiating pace, profitably growing share as a direct result of the total value we are
delivering and the brand equity we are building.
Before Steve sums up, let me touch on a couple of items for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. During the second
quarter, we raised our dividend by another 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share. We plan to return nearly $2 billion to
shareholders in dividends payments over the next year.
As Larry mentioned, we expect to close the Catamaran merger in July. After financing of the transaction, our projected
debt to total capital will be around 48% in the third quarter. We are committed to sustaining our strong financial
position and current debt ratings and expect to reduce debt to total capital in short order.
With the deal expected to close in two weeks, we are incorporating Catamaran into our 2015 outlook. We foresee
Catamaran adding around $10 billion in revenues this year with full-year 2015 UnitedHealth Group revenues now
growing 18% year-over-year to approximately $154 billion. And we now expect cash flows to be $8.4 billion to $8.6
billion in 2015. In addition, we are increasing our outlook for our earnings per share to a range of $6.25 to $6.35 per
share. The improvement comes from our core operating performance with Catamaran's impact on earnings over the
balance of 2015 offset by interest, amortization, and integration costs. We continue to foresee strong revenue, earnings
accretion, and cash flows from Catamaran in 2016, and increasing levels thereafter. But again, Larry described for you
the real story, which is the future value creation.
Steve?
Stephen J. Hemsley
Thank you, Dave. Larry and Dave have given you some sense for why we continue to be optimistic about our potential
to deliver value throughout the broad health system and to grow. Let me just comment briefly before we summarize
today's report. Certainly, we all recognize this market space has been exceptionally active this quarter. Beyond that
observation, we do not believe it is our place to comment on market-specific activities or hypothetical implications that
we are not involved in. And we're not going to comment on the activities of others or speculate on subsequent
processes or market dynamics; no one really yet knows. Our focus remains squarely on the continued growth and
expanded capability of our enterprise and how we can serve our customers more effectively.
The markets we serve are changing in positive ways that call upon our competencies we have cultivated for years, and
accordingly, these changes hold prospects for years of positive growth and the continued expansion of our products and
services. Our capabilities are strengthening, and we are expanding into natural market adjacencies. We are intensely
focused on these opportunities and committed to driving higher and more consistent performance for customers across
our businesses.
The key elements of our efforts going forward are familiar and fundamental: truly focusing on serving consumers, care
providers, and benefit sponsors; creating and adopting simpler more modern approaches around how healthcare is paid
for, around information transparency, consumer engagement and care access and care provider support; developing
valuable long-term relationships with strong partners; pricing products and services to deliver real value to the
market because our design approach and underlying cost structures are market-leading; executing to serve the key
future growth areas for Optum, clinical care, integrated pharmacy care, technology solutions and government services;
thoughtfully moving forward into targeted global menus; using capital to strengthen capabilities then improve and
expand our growth potential; and cultivating capabilities that will be important to the future more than the past.
With that, we thank you. And, operator, we'll now take questions.

[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - David Howard Windley>: Thanks. Good morning. Steve, acknowledging your comments about market activity,
wondering if with Catamaran now near closed, what is United's appetite for further M&A activity? And maybe
dovetailing that, what is your current view on provider consolidation and balance of power in local markets as it relates
to negotiating your cost position? Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, in terms of commentary along those lines, we have been building our business and
diversifying our businesses, kind of, across the landscape of our business model for several years. And we can expect to
continue to – continue those approaches, continue to diversify our business as we said in the natural market
adjacencies. Continue to deploy capital in ways that we think makes sense for us; continue to fill in market positions
and to build on capabilities. So I don't think anything's really changed in that domain and I don't think there's any
reason to think otherwise.
Our businesses are well-positioned across the expansive benefits and across services. We are well-positioned across
virtually all the key markets. And I think that we can continue to drive very strong cost positions, have plenty of scale
across all our business segments. So we're just going to continue to run our business and maintain that approach. So I
don't think anything has really changed, David.
<Q - David Howard Windley>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: Yes. I was hoping you could maybe help us understand how much impact there was
on the medical cost ratio from higher acuity enrollment? I mean, I think we can probably do our own math on the
growth in the MA Medicaid enrollment relative to commercial. But since you're not giving the commercial MCR
anymore, I was just looking for whatever additional insight you could provide on that.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Again, I think because it really reflects more of the reality and the diversity of our
business. But I don't know if we can give you something that is so precise, but, Dan, you want to take a shot?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Sure, Matt. Good morning.
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: So in terms of our care ratios and our performance in the quarter, they were very much
in line with our expectation. And then underneath that, as Dave mentioned, we continue to drive very low trends, which
is why we're orienting towards the lower half of our prior guidance. Obviously, there is impacts associated with the 1.3
million lives we've added over the last 12 months in Medicare, Medicaid as well as in exchanges, which have higher
relative care ratios.
But I think as you step back and look at it, we've been able to drive a 20-basis-point improvement on a year-over-year
basis. We have a little higher pricing for reform fees, which is helping that offset by a little less development. And
when you compare that to the prior quarter – prior-year quarter, we did have revenue true-ups in there related to our
government programs. So when we look at it on a consolidated basis, it's very much in keeping with our expectations,
and we have strong confidence in our full-year outlook of 80.8% plus or minus 50 basis points.
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: If I can, just one quick follow-up on that. The prior – you mentioned the prior-year
development or the prior-period development. I notice you didn't break out between inter-year and prior year, or I

Operator
We'll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick from Mizuho. Your line is open.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Good morning. Thank you very much. And a very nice job, again. If we can focus on the
Catamaran transaction for a moment, since that is something that is going forward and new as opposed to looking
backwards, as I suspect you'd like us to shift our focus. A couple of questions around that. First of all, the new model
that you're describing for – a new value proposition for the OptumRX business in conjunction with Catamaran, can you
elaborate a little bit?
I heard what you said, Larry, and I understand that you're basically trying to change the conversation away from a finite
how much more efficiently can we fill prescriptions to something that is much more clinically focused and much more
targeted at helping the ultimate payers to manage the spend and improve the health of the patient. Can you talk a little
bit about why you're doing that now with Catamaran and why you couldn't do that before? That's question number one.
And question number two. Can you set our minds at ease a little bit about how you're thinking about retaining – and
you've answered this question before – but retaining large-scale customers that Catamaran currently has in the phase of
the transition to ownership by a competing health plan? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I'll let Larry handle the bulk of this. But I would say that we – OptumRX was clearly
on a path to a more comprehensive and integrated approach using data and analytics and engaging in the clinical
protocol before. The intensity of that has increased, the advent of specialty pharma has clearly been an element of that
and allows us to actually engage it even more effectively, as you know.
And the only other comment I would offer is, is we are intensely focused on serving all of our customers and serving
the expectations of the Catamaran customers for sure and their expectations. There's significant value coming their way
from this combination. And we think that that is going to be compelling and we're looking to build that business not
only for current customers, but to expand that business as well. Larry, would you want to add to that?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. So, Sheryl, I'll come at it a couple of ways. Steve said this and we're laser-focused on
our customers right now. And that's not only customers that we have at Optum, but also when we have the ability to get
to the customers of Catamaran. As you know, we're, kind of, limited right now and the transaction hasn't been
approved. So we haven't had a lot of interaction with them yet. But I think that if I kind of looked at the timing on this
and what we're trying to do and why we did the transaction, it kind of fits with why I think this is going to work pretty
well.
Number one. We needed scale. And that's what we're going to have now that we have the volumes that Catamaran
brings to this. So scale's going to be there. Obviously, we have been on their technology for 10 years. So this makes it
an easy integration. And we're going to have enhanced technology that's going to benefit both organizations.
But I – we get into what Steve was talking about some distinctive capabilities, whether that's the specialty drug side or
that's synchronization. And if I was looking at that on the synchronization side, we would be looking at data, modeling,
analytics, kind of the things that we do every day, tying that together with our clinical and case management programs
and engaging the providers and members. So this is a profound program that we're putting in place at this point around
synchronization that Tim Wicks has been working on in OptumRX that we will now tie in together with Catamaran.

Page 8 of 16
And then, the specialty, obviously, drug side, we're focused with synchronization being part of that as well as trend
management, case management, as well as just the purchasing power that with the scale will bring.
I think the fourth area would be our well-rounded management team. Now, we're going to have a very, very strong
sales organization as well as service organization. So that works very well. And it's good timing on all this. And I think
everyone knows that this is a very complementary business. With Catamaran, a big focus on retail, where we're on the
employer side and government; they are strong in their relationships and sales; we're strong in service; both are strong
in technology. So it's just good timing right now. We believe we can move the dial a bit with the organizations
together. And I can comment more on this after we get this approved.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And I'd say that goes along with a broader theme of across the businesses of really taking
fresh looks, using information, approaching the marketplace in a more comprehensive and integrated way, engaging
local resources to targeted groups so that we can improve their access to care, their use of resources and change their
consumer experience as well. So it plays to us across a whole spectrum of areas and pharmaceuticals and specialty
pharma is really just one of those themes.
Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Schenker>: Thanks. Good morning. So I appreciate some of your earlier comments here on cost trend in
MLRs versus your expectations, and maybe if you could just provide any additional color on how maybe the
components there, utilization, and unit costs are really developing across your book and then remind us how that
compare to your initial expectations?
And related to that, one of your peers highlighted some higher utilization in the Medicare books specifically, anything
you're seeing there versus commercial and Medicaid? Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dan, you want to comment?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Andy. This is Dan. Again, reiterate that, certainly our costs in this
quarter were well within our expectation. And we continue to drive a low trend relatively speaking. And I think when
you look at the combination of factors that impacted, it starts first with a benefit design that rewards consumers for
better choices. And then we're aligning that with provider relationships that incentivize more appropriate use of health
resources. And then we overlay our medical management on that. And that starts with our people.
And we've got people in UnitedHealthcare and Optum across facilities, across the country, as well as in neighborhoods,
as Dave mentioned, and in people's home. And when we look at the combination of all those things, we've been able to
drive a very consistent utilization trend across all of our businesses within the UnitedHealthcare portfolio and, again,
well within our expectations.
To your comments about what you're seeing in others around hospital use and so forth, specifically on that, we have not
seen anything outside of normal seasonal variation. So it's all in keeping with our expectation. And I think it's important
to remember, as we've talked before, we've got a lot of visibility on the hospital side, who's coming in, who's there,
who's leaving, how we're interacting with them, facilitating their discharge and so forth. And this is really a strength of
our company. And we continue to drive absolute reductions in per capita hospital usage. And we've been talking about
that for the last six years.
So, again, from our perspective, very much in keeping with our expectations in the quarter. Nothing that I would
highlight by category or by business, frankly.

<Q - Andrew Schenker>: Hey, Dan, if I can just squeeze a quick follow-up in there. I mean, you, obviously,
highlighted medical management and benefit design. Do you think United is maybe doing better than the overall
market as a result of those? Or do you think that you're still generally in line with the broader market on some of these
trends?

And our next question comes from Christine Arnold from Cowen. Your line is open.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Okay. Thanks for the question. Your OptumInsight backlog is up significantly. You
talked a lot about Optum360. How does the composition of your business change over time? And how might the
changing mix of business change earnings growth and seasonality in the future? And then, as a second, kind of,
unrelated question, is there any way to quantify the out-of-period revenue you experienced a year ago, so we can kind
of think about underlying core MLRs? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Maybe I'll have John, kind of, start the themes, and then send that down to a couple
of the business leads.
<A - John Rex>: Hi. Good morning, Christine. John Rex here. So just a few thoughts here on the backlog and how that
relates to, kind of, the – what we see going on in OptumInsight. So a few things here. As we talk about the backlog, one
of the things that we've been noting here is that continues to be driven by the external business, commercial business
that OptumInsight has been successful at gaining. In particular, in driving those increases are the – we go back to the
theme of the larger, deeper and more comprehensive relationships that we've been pursuing for some time.
You saw us making considerable investments and OptumInsight a couple of years ago. And that impacted some of the
progression. And we spiked that out and tried to highlight that. And in particular, it was related to those kind of
relationships. As they come on, they typically come on and we need to invest. It takes them a while to mature and then
they start contributing. So part of what you're seeing in OptumInsight this year some of those investments we made a
couple of years ago maturing, starting to come on line. But our aspiration is to continue to make those and continue to
make those in a way that we can balance both our – the growth that we're looking for as well as deliver on those
commitments. So I'm going to let – ask Bill Miller to make a few comments and give a little more detail in terms of
exactly where that's occurring.
<A - Bill Miller>: Yeah, thanks, John, you did a good job at touching on the Optum360. If I broaden the spectrum a
little bit, I think there's primarily three factors why you see this pipeline growing and certainly the backlog growing.
One, I just think is a very strong focus on our markets, understanding the pressures that are boiling up there, really
getting inside of the trends there. And I think we do a really good job of anticipating those trends, which cascades to the
next thing.
As we spend a lot of time with our clients, interpreting how these pressures and trends are going to have to be solved
for inside of whether they're a provider, a payer, government, life sciences businesses. And so really building with
them, in concert with them, with their input solutions that really help solve and help them thrive in an environment that
is becoming more and more performance-based. And I'd say, thematically, our portfolio is really shape-charged for
helping our clients move into more of a performance-based environment.
And then, finally, I would say, we execute and deliver. We have great outcomes on the big, large, end-to-end contracts
that we've undertaken, but we execute every day on our software solutions, our more stand-alone solutions. And that
track record continues to strengthen, and the market is recognizing it.

Our next question is from Brian Wright from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian Michael Wright>: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify, on the higher acuities with the Medicaid
and Medicare and the exchanges. I just wanted to make sure that the exchange MLR is within your expectations as
well, too?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Very much – Jeff or Dan? Who do you want?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Sure. I'd be happy to take it. Brian, on the exchanges, obviously, when we talked about
how we were going to approach this market in 2013 and then in 2014 and beyond, our expectation was to get more
fully involved this year, which we've done. We've seen some really nice growth. But as we talked about last quarter and
we talked coming in, we didn't have an expectation of any meaningful contribution on a margin standpoint. So from a
care ratio, it's in keeping with expectations, but, obviously, higher than what our traditional commercial book would be.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: As we expected.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: As expected, yes.
<Q - Brian Michael Wright>: Okay. So nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing surprising in what you see?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Hey, Brian, it's Jeff Alter. No, nothing. As we mentioned, as we were preparing for 2015, we were
very purposeful in building both the products and networks that supported those price points. And as a matter of fact,
we grew where we thought we would grow in the markets that we thought, with the products that we thought. And we
were pleased we actually grew a little more than we expected. So we're pleased with where we're at with exchanges.
And it's a growing, emerging, developing market, and we're planning for that as we pace forward.
<Q - Brian Michael Wright>: And, sorry, just [indiscernible] (39:02) but the better-than-expected growth isn't coming
at the cost of worse-than-expected medical costs in that bucket?
<A - Jeff Alter>: No, absolutely not. We're growing where we thought we would, with the products and the network
designs and economics that supported those price points.

<Q>: Hi. Good morning. I just had one little knit and then kind of my real question. I think it was Larry who said $42
million of Catamaran merger costs in the first quarter. Is there a 2Q number you have for us?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think that was Dave.
<Q>: Okay.
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: There is no meaningful Q2 costs. We recorded the costs associated with the Catamaran
merger, the transaction costs in the first quarter.
<Q>: In the first quarter? Okay. Thank you. So the question I wanted to ask, I'm sure you guys saw the CMS
announcement last Friday proposing to bundle roughly 25% of Medicare hips and knees in 2016 into a bundled

payment methodology. I just wondered if you can maybe talk just for a couple minutes on conceptually your
experience with bundled payments on the commercial side. Are you using bundled payments in your ACOs? Or is that
more risk sharing agreements and capitation? And do you see this – the CMS announcement as an opportunity to push
for more bundled payments in your commercial book?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Dan, you want to comment on that?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: You bet. Good morning, [ph] Gary (40:37). So as it relates to our value-based
reimbursement in the program, we've talked historically about the continuum, working from less progressive to more
progressive reimbursement methods and, sort of, sitting in the middle of that are bundled payments. Today we deploy
them in – if you think about our $36 billion of value-based reimbursement at the end of 2014 or the $43 billion we'll
have at the end of 2015, we've got about 5% staked in that bundled payment category.
And from our perspective, it is a good mechanism along the journey towards a more progressive population orientation
around outcomes and value and quality. But at the core of it, it still doesn't specifically address the volume of
utilization, so the number of bundles, right. So as we look at progressing, we're looking to get to more comprehensive
alignment around total population cost. So it is a piece. It's productive and positive, but it's just part of a broader
solution.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Right.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question come is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Great. Thanks. I wanted to dig into the two comments you made about guidance. I
guess, first on 2015, it sounds like although the revenue number for Catamaran, or the revenue increase is mostly
Catamaran, the earnings increase is not. So I was wondering if you could break out what is driving the increase in
earnings this year versus your expectations last quarter?
And then second, Steve, I think you said that you expect earnings growth to accelerate next year. And I just wanted to
see if that was due to Catamaran and whether you would make that same comment on a core basis, whether the core
United would have grown or growth would have accelerated even without the Catamaran deal?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I'll wade into this and let Dave deal with specifics, particularly, around the revenue
break. But we are not expecting a contribution from Catamaran in the balance of the year. Basically, its earnings will be
offset by integration costs, interest expense elements such as that. The improved performance is really the core –
historic core businesses and, actually, UnitedHealthcare is in a strong period and a big contributor to that. But the
beauty of our construct is that it's a broad-based portfolio. And really the vast majority of the businesses are performing
very strongly. And we see growing momentum. We clearly expect 2016 to be a even stronger year. I think we basically
have held that posture consistently. And that would be in the core business, not just Catamaran.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: But, I guess, just no finer point on the 2015 guidance rate? Is it 50%/50%? Or is one
business causing more of the improvement?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dave?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Most of the improvement in – for the guidance for the balance of the year comes from
expectations out of UnitedHealthcare. And as for the revenue guidance, you're right, it increased in the quarter, but
predominantly, related to Catamaran. That said, all the businesses improved their revenue forecasts for the balance of
the year, just not enough to round up further.

<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: You're saying United's better, but you reaffirmed the MLR guidance, so what's driving
the UnitedHealth better performance?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: UnitedHealth better performance is predominantly coming from growth...
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, growth.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Growth.
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Very strong growth. 1.6 million people year-over-year, 1.4 million for the balance of
the year, very strong growth momentum really commencing about this time last year, and actually, earlier for Medicaid
and for the government programs broadly.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Wasn't the 1.4 million – wasn't that the same number last year? Wasn't that your –
clearly, last quarter, wasn't that your guidance for membership this year last quarter as well?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: I think that's right, yeah. It's the same.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: But you're raising guidance on better growth?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Yeah. We're raising guidance on growth and we're raising guidance $0.10 at the
bottom end of the range and a $0.05 at the top end of the range. And we're raising that guidance based upon better
visibility on growth and performance in the business.

<Q - A.J. Rice>: Thanks. Hello, everybody. Maybe I'll ask a little more broad question about Medicare Advantage.
Obviously, the bids are now in for next year. You haven't had a chance to comment in a big forum like this about your
thinking about how that will go for next year and [audio gap] (46:04) for margin gains, enrollment, that type of thing.
Any broad color on that now that the bids are in?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I'll let Steve Nelson comment on that. Pretty positive, but obviously, at this stage, we're
not going to give real – much precision around next year. But from a thematic point of view, Steve?
<A - Steven Nelson>: Sure. Good morning, A.J. It's Steve Nelson. As Steve said, it is obviously too early to be
specific. Don't have CMS approval on our benefits submissions yet. But at a high level, we really like how the
Medicare Advantage business is positioned for 2016. We are poised to offer stable benefits and distinctive value to
both new and existing customers. And this is really just at a high level a result of the work that we've done over the past
couple of years to reshape our networks.
We introduced premiums more broadly into our membership this year. We've introduced, developed, and implemented
new and unique customer service model, we call it, Advocate for Me. We think it's distinctive. We have more effective
clinical models and clinical capabilities in conjunction with our partnership with Optum. And when you couple that
with really strong local brand, really like our position and excited about the growth opportunities in this Medicare
Advantage business for 2016.

Our next question is from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Peter Heinz Costa>: Hi. I'm hoping you can give us some specifics around your MLR this quarter, in particular,
on three items that you've broken out or a couple that you've broken out anyways. The first being the overall mix. What
was the actual impact from mix on the MLR this quarter?
Second is, what was the impact from the revenue true-ups that you mentioned? And were those favorable or
unfavorable true-ups? And I assume some of that relates to the risk adjuster in the New York small-group market.
And the last question is your eliminations went up this quarter sequentially. Usually, they're more flat except for last
year when you were bringing in the PBM revenues, but they were up again this quarter sequentially. And I'm, kind of,
wondering why they were up and did that have any impact on your MLR this quarter?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. I don't think the eliminations have really any impact. But, Dan, you want to try to
address the other two?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Sure. Peter, we're not going to get into the specifics of spiking out the mix impact and
the revenue true-ups. Obviously, as you think about the things influencing the quarter and as you compare to the same
quarter last year, on a mix basis, we would have a rising care ratio just based on greater orientations to Medicare
Advantage, Medicaid, and exchange enrollment.
Revenue true-ups, I referenced earlier, so in last year's second quarter, we recognized government-based revenue
true-ups, which were favorable. So as you look at the comp year-over-year, that would be something that would be
working against that comparison on a year-over-year basis.
And then, as you look at the second quarter this year, on the revenue side, we had expected in the commercial business
to be receivers on the risk adjustment. And we did a little bit better on risk adjustment in the commercial business in the
second quarter related to 2014.
So those are the things that are all coming together. But when you step back from it, we've seen a decline in our care
ratio on a consolidated basis year-over-year, our medical costs are in line with our expectations. And our trends are
trending towards the lower half of the guidance that we've provided previously. So as we look at the second quarter, it
is very much in line with what we were thinking before we got into it. And as we exit it, we have confidence about the
balance of the year.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And last year was affected by the true-ups.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Yeah, it was last year.
<Q - Peter Heinz Costa>: Okay. Then, just a follow-up. Why did the eliminations go up sequentially this quarter?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dave, you want to take?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Peter, they go up as UnitedHealthcare grows, so too does Optum, because
UnitedHealthcare is obviously a customer of Optum. So when you look at them, you'll actually see that Optum's overall
growth rate is growing at a faster rate than the eliminations, if you will, which suggests that Optum is growing faster
externally than they are through the internal business with UnitedHealthcare.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Which is the case.

And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Thanks. First, just a quick clarification and then a question. The clarification just you guys
don't talk about cash earnings, but I was curious if you could give us what your estimate for a cash earnings EPS
guidance would be this year. And the $0.30 that you talked about for Catamaran, I just want to make sure that's a
GAAP number, and I guess, maybe what would be the cash estimate?
And then, real question. Just around the national accounts business, we're getting through July here. I'm curious what
you're seeing for 2016. Any changes in the competitive dynamics? Have you guys thought about different strategies for
sales in light of what's perceived to be industry dissonance, et cetera?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I'll have Dave do the earnings and Jeff can comment on the national business.
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Yeah. So, Josh, we may be unique in this regard. But we only report numbers on a
GAAP basis. So in every case, they include the application of the amortization of intangibles, which are pretty
consistent in our business. If you look at 2015, the effects on EPS would be about $0.34 per share. If you look back to
2014, it'd be the same, $0.34 per share. And, yes, the forward view on the 2016 accretion for Catamaran was a
GAAP-based number as well.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: And, Dave, so what would the cash accretion be on Catamaran next year?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Catamaran will carry about $0.20 of amortization per year.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Okay. Perfect.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Morning, Josh. It's Jeff Alter. So we had a really strong 2015 national account season and that
momentum is continuing. We've been very purposeful in focusing on our customers' needs to deliver a total reduction
in costs for them. So the partnership that we've been able to create with our existing clients and with bringing Optum
resource to the table have resonated in that market.
As far as 2016 goes, right now, it's improved over where we were in 2015. We've got a couple of new strategic wins
already booked. Some growth in existing clients in slices of business that we didn't have. And we've retained today all
our key clients that were out for bid. We'll give you more clarity as the season kind of wraps up during our next call.

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. We don't – we're not going to provide cost ratios with respect to that. But we'll give
you a sense of the other.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Sure. Hi, Sean. It's Dan Schumacher. Your question for – I'm assuming it's oriented
towards the large customers, right, because if you look into our fully-insured offering downmarket, we have full and
total pull-through of all OptumCare disease management, pharmacy, clinical analytics, data and so forth in managing
those populations. So looking upmarket, the UnitedHealthcare national accounts block, we have about a third of them
have pharmacy through OptumRX, so two-thirds represents an opportunity for us as an enterprise.
As you think about the other services, we have – the vast majority of them have care management, disease management
and other engagement routines through Optum. So the only one where we have less penetration is around pharmacy.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Then, on the last piece of it, Sean, the only thing I might comment is that when you look at
across the cohorts of clients and then take a look at the clients that really embrace the kind of the more maximum of the
offerings that we have from both UnitedHealthcare and from Optum, those clients tend to actually have performance
levels that are superior. So when a client progressively leans towards the more modern approaches that we are offering,
as Dan and Jeff had described before in terms of designs, engagement of the consumer, the clinical programs and the
use of the high-performing networks that are incentive-based, incentives on both ends, their performance from a
cost-trend point of view, from a satisfaction point of view tends to be stronger. Next question, please.

And our next question is from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Yes, thanks. Good morning. So one question I had was, there's obviously angst around MLR,
but you're reaffirming your guidance. Have you any thoughts or suggestions for the Street around how the seasonal
variation should be looked at now with exchanges, with [indiscernible] (56:53)? Any other changes around small-group
and so on?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I really don't think so. I really think the question really comes around mix. And it is really
more of the mix of the membership and where the growth has come from in the higher care ratio categories. I really
think it's as simple as that.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: And then, just to follow up on that question, on the small-group, which is becoming
ACA-compliant from 50 to 100, how do you see that playing out for 2016 and maybe if there is early renewals, we had
some volatility last year. What are you seeing in the marketplace? Might that actually create more stability? Or would
the risk pool estimation might there be an issue?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning, Ana. It's Jeff Alter. What we are preparing for and expecting is very similar to what
happened in the fourth quarter of 2013, when there was transitional relief in some early renewal programs for the 2 to
50 block. We assume that will happen again this year in the 51 to 99. And we're ready for it. And we've got – we're
geared up with products and other offerings to serve what those clients might want to do when transition relief or early
renewal programs are offered.

<Q - Tom A. Carroll>: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So somewhat related to Josh's
question. With all the action, if you will, in the managed care space, do you think that employee benefit consultants and
brokers may give United a stronger look in 2016 than they might otherwise? And maybe conversely, asking another
way, are you guys perhaps being any more proactive with these sales sources and highlighting your focus relative to
others into next year? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think I can address that. First of all, as we said, we're not going to comment on market
dynamics that are driven by anything other than prevailing market dynamics. Always looking for more value, always
looking for more innovation and so forth. And I really do believe the momentum of our business has been advancing,
our capabilities have been advancing. And we're engaging the market as productively as we ever have been.
And we are continuing to focus on that, serving customers, and really responding to them. And we're seeing some of
that in the results in terms of the retention, the response to our offerings, the broader penetration of offerings to
customers. We're just going to keep on that. And I think that's the best response that we have been on it, we're going to
continue to stay on it. And I think the market has been influx and looking for value. And so we're just going to stay on
it.

So with that, we'll conclude. Thank you for your questions this morning. As always, this interaction is helpful in
framing our thinking around information we offer you and we do our Investor Conference that will be coming up again
in New York City on [audio gap] (01:00:18) 1. So we'd ask you to hold that date for your – on your calendars and we
will make sure that that is a substantive engagement for all of you.
And to wrap up, through the first half of 2015, UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare have delivered an
advancing momentum and strong growth in revenues, in earnings, in cash flows and the number of people and
customers we serve. And we expect this growth to continue and accelerate in 2016 and beyond.
As I said, we remain focused on further improving service, cultivating and expanding our capabilities and market
positions, introducing practical innovations, and the potential to make healthcare work even better. So thank you, and
we'll see you next quarter.
