I will now turn the call over to Richard.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Judy and good morning everyone. We're pleased to share our results with you today and I'll begin with the
highlights on page three of the presentation. U.S. Bank recorded net income of $1.3 billion for the first quarter of 2012
or $0.67 per diluted common share.
Total net revenue was higher by 9.1% over the same quarter of 2011, driven by 7.3% growth in net interest income and
11.3% growth in fee revenue. Total average loans grew year-over-year and linked quarter by 6.4% and 1.5%
respectively. And we also experienced strong loan growth in total average deposits of 11.7% over the prior year and
2.2% linked quarter.
Credit quality continued to improve as net charges-offs declined by 8.2%. Our non-performing assets decreased in total
by 8.5% from the prior quarter. We continue to generate significant capital each quarter. Our Tier 1 common equity
ratio was 8.7% at March 31st, or 8.4% using anticipated Basel III guidelines, while the Tier 1 capital ratio ended the
quarter at 10.9%. Capital actions this quarter included a 56% dividend increase and we repurchased 16 million shares
of common stock during the first quarter.
The five quarter trends of our industry leading performance metrics are shown on left hand side of slide four. Return on
average assets in the first quarter was 1.6% and return on average common equity was 16.2%. We stated that our
company can achieve a normalized ROA in the range of 1.6% to 1.9% and an ROE between 16% and 19%, both
performance ratios have now reached the respective ranges.
Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right hand side of slide four. This quarter's
net interest margin of 3.6% was nine basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, but equal to the prior quarter.
And Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a couple of minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter
was 51.9%, and consistent with our expectations, this ratio will remain in the low 50.
Turning to slide five. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. On March 31st, our Tier 1 common
equity ratio using anticipated Basel III guidelines was 8.4%. At 8.4%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum
requirement and above the level at which we believe we need to be.
Turning to slide six. On March 13th, after receiving the results of our 2012 comprehensive capital analysis and review
from the Federal Reserve, we announced a $0.28 or 56% increase in our annual dividend. In addition to the dividend
increase, the Board authorized a new 100 million share repurchase program.
As we've indicated in the past, our long-term goal is to return between 60% and 80% of our earnings to our
shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During the first quarter, we returned 66% of our earnings to our
shareholders, 29% of which in the form of dividend and 37% in the form of share buybacks.
Average total loans outstanding increased by $12.6 billion or 6.6% year-over-year. As expected linked quarter, loan
growth and average total of loans was 1.5%. Significantly new loan originations excluding mortgage production plus
new and renewed commitments totaled over $36 billion this quarter, this represents a 4.5% year-over-year increase in
new and renewed lending activity.
Total revolving corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased year-over-year by 25.7% and 5.1% on a
linked quarter basis, while utilization remained fairly consistent at approximately 25%. Total average deposits
increased by $24 billion or 11.7% over the same quarter last year. While total average deposits grew by $5 billion on a
linked quarter basis or 2.2%.

Turning to slide eight. The company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.9 billion, an increase of 9.1%
over the prior quarters -- year's quarter, 3.4% less than previous quarter. Recall however, that the fourth quarter
included $263 million litigation settlement gain.
Excluding this gain, linked quarter revenue growth was $88 million or 1.8%. The company's revenue growth can be
attributed to both our balance sheet and our fee business is growing, as we continue to benefit from our investments and
growth initiatives over the past years.
Turning to slide nine in credit quality. First quarter total net charge-offs declined by 8.2% from the fourth quarter of
2011, while non-performing assets decreased by 8.5% or 5.9% excluding covered assets. The ratio of net charge-offs to
average loans outstanding was 1.09%, improving from the 1.19% reported in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 10. As the graph on the left hand illustrates, early and late stage delinquencies excluding covered
assets improved this quarter. On the right hand side of slide 10, you can see that the trend in credit sized assets
continues to show improvement.
Both of these statistics provide us with confidence that net charge-offs and non-performing assets will trend lower in
the second quarter of 2012. Although, net charge-offs may show a more modest reduction than in recent quarters, as the
pace of improvement slows in the consumer category. Given the first quarter's credit results and the expected
improvement going forward, we released $19 million of reserves compared with $125 million in the fourth quarter and
$50 million in the first quarter of 2011.
I'll now turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Richard. Slide 11 gives you a view of our first quarter 2012 results versus comparable time periods. Diluted
EPS of $0.67 was 28.8% higher than the first quarter of 2011 and 2.9% lower than the prior quarter. Recall that the
fourth quarter EPS included $0.05 related to two notable items.
Slide 12 lists the key drivers of the company's first quarter earnings. The 27.9% increase in net income year-over-year
was the result of 9.1% increase in net revenue, and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. Partially offset by
10.6% increase in non-interest expense. Net income was slightly lower on a linked quarter basis.
The unfavorable variance was the result of 3.4% decline in net revenue, partially offset by lower non-interest expense.
And a $16 million decrease in the provision for credit losses. Excluding the impact of the two notable items detailed on
slide 13, net revenue increased by 1.8% quarter-over-quarter and non-interest expense was flat.
Slide 13 provides you more detail about the notable items that impacted the comparison of our first quarter to prior
periods. In the fourth quarter of 2011, total net interest income included $263 million litigation settlement gain related
to the termination of the merchant processing referral agreement. We also booked $130 million expense accrual related
to mortgage servicing and for closure related matters.
On a net basis, these two items increased fourth quarter net income by approximately $92 million and EPS by $0.05.
The first quarter of 2011 included $46 million gain related to the acquisition of First Community Bank of New Mexico
from the FDIC. Also noted in the bottom of slide 13 are two revenue and expense classification changes that had an
impact on comparisons to prior periods.
Moving to slide 14. Net net interest income increased year-over-year $183 million or 7.3%. The increase was largely
driven by the $26.1 billion or 9.5% increase in average earnings assets as well as the benefit from strong growth and
low cost deposits. The growth in average earning assets was driven by planned increases in the securities portfolio and
growth in average total loans, partially offset by a lower cash position of the Federal Reserve.
The net interest margin of 3.60% was nine basis points lower from the same quarter of last year, due primarily to the
expected increase in lower yield investment securities, partially offset by lower cash balances of the Fed and the

inclusion of a credit card balance transfer fee.
On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $17 million. Average earning assets grew by $4.9 billion
and net interest margin was flat to the prior quarter. Margin was slightly better than expected this quarter, primarily due
to the inclusion of balance transfer fees and lower cash balances at the Fed.
Given the current environment, we expect the net interest margin will be down a few basis points in the second quarter.
The investment securities portfolio at March 31st, totaled $74.3 billion. The balances were higher than December 31st,
as we took the opportunity to manage down our cash balances and purchase investment securities. We expect to mainly
invest in -- maintain the investment securities portfolio at or around this level for the next few quarters.
Slide 15 provides you with more detail behind the changes in average total loans outstanding. Average total loans grew
by 6.4% year-over-year, excluding covered loans or runoff portfolio, average total loans increased by 8.7%
year-over-year. As you can see on the chart, the increase in average total loans was principally due to strong growth in
commercial loans and residential mortgages of 17.3% and 19.1% respectively.
Commercial loan growth has continued to accelerate over the past five quarters, while growth in consumer lending has
been less robust. On a linked quarter basis, the 1.5% increase in average total loans outstanding was also primarily
driven by an increase in commercial loans, which grew by 3.4% and residential real estate loans which grew by 4.3%.
Slide 16 provides more detail on the growth in total deposits over the past five quarters. Average total deposits grew by
$24 billion or 11.7% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits increased by $5 billion or 2.2%.
Importantly, average low cost deposits accounted for the majority of the increases on a year-over-year and linked
quarter basis.
Slide 17 provides more details around the changes in non-interest income on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis.
Non-interest income increased by 11.3% over the same quarter of 2011. Mortgage banking revenue was very strong
this quarter as production increased by 58% year-over-year and gain-on-sale margins improved.
Offsetting a portion of the growth in origination and sales fee income were an unfavorable net change in MSR
valuation and related hedging of approximately $32 million and an increase in the repurchase reserve. In addition to
mortgage banking, merchant processing services, deposit service charges and commercial products revenue also posted
solid increases year-over-year.
These positive variances were partially offset by a lower credit card and debit card fees due to legislative changes to
debit card interchange, as well as the change in classification of balance transfer fees. Offsetting the impact of these
two items were legislative related mitigation activity and higher transaction volumes.
ATM services revenue was lower as a result of the change related to revenue pass through to others. And finally, other
income in the first quarter of 2011 included $46 million gain related to the FDIC transaction. On a linked quarter basis,
non-interest income was lower by $192 million or 7.9%. This favorable variance was primarily the result of the
merchant settlement gain in the fourth quarter of 2011, seasonally lower payments related revenue and the revenue
classification changes, partially offset by very strong mortgage banking activity.
Slide 18 highlights non-interest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $246 million or 10.6%. The majority of
the increase can be attributed to higher compensation and benefits expense, representing additional staffing in the
branches, mortgage-related activities and business expansions initiatives, an increase in professional services, primarily
due to technology and foreclosure review projects as well as marketing and business development expense and other
expense related to regulatory insurance related cost. These higher costs were partially offset by a decrease in net
occupancy related to the change in ATM revenue pass through to others.
On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense was lower by $136 million or 5%, primarily due to the fourth quarter
mortgage servicing accrual, occupancy expense, partially offset by seasonally higher employee benefits. The tax rate on
a taxable equivalent basis was 30.9% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with 30.5% in the fourth quarter of 2011
and 29% in the first quarter of 2011.

Slide 19 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage, purchase related expense and a reserve for unexpected
losses and repurchases and make-whole payments. For outstanding repurchases and make-whole request balance as at
March 31st, was $134 million, compared with $105 million at December 31st. The increase in addition of recent
changes in the GSE's sampling method, specifically higher sizes causes to increase our mortgage representation and
mortgages reserve to $202 million. We do, however, expect mortgage repurchase requests to remain fairly stable over
the next several quarters.
I'll now turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Andy. And to conclude our formal remarks, I turn your attention to slide 20. The momentum continues, words
from the cover of our annual report that appropriately describe our 2011 accomplishments and performance and our
first quarter results demonstrated the momentum we've built over the past several years, continues to build into the new
year.
In the first quarter, we grew our balance sheet and our customer base, we grew our net revenue. We continue to invest
in organic growth initiatives as well as small but important fill-in acquisitions, including the 10 branch banking
franchise of BankEast in Knoxville, Tennessee; the Indiana Corporate Trust business from UMB Bank and an
Institutional Trust business from Union Bank in California.
In the first quarter, our credit quality continued to improve. Our capital liquidity positions remain strong, and we grew
our earnings and achieved industry leading performance metrics for the quarter and we were able to return 66% of our
earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
We continue to benefit from our investments and growth initiatives in innovation and in acquisitions. We continue to
benefit from our prudent risk management and our diversified business model and we benefit from our markets, both
established and new.
Today we'll be holding our Annual Meeting here in Minneapolis, our headquarter city. In addition to conducting the
official business with the meeting, I'll be sharing our story of how we have managed this company through the
downturn and we are continuing to capitalize on the momentum we've built.
I'll also tell the shareholders how exceedingly proud I am, with what we've accomplished and of the 64,000 remarkable
and engaged employees that have contributed to our success. I look forward to the coming year as we grow even
stronger for the benefit of our customers, employees, communities and importantly, our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.

Good morning. First of all, I guess just wonder if you can give some color commentary around loan demand trends
through the quarter? Do you still see, are there any particular pockets of strength, weakness sector; either by sector or
by geography?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. This is Richard. As we stated 90 days ago, we thought that the trends would slow from quarter four, probably
because of the seasonality of the new year and we saw the ending of the quarter kind of slowing down and it turned out
to be correct.
In this case, we're starting to see what I expected was a slow but seasonal increase as we move in to quarter two.
Quarter one got stronger as it aged and quarter two is looking at least as good as quarter one, if not was slight biased on
the positive side. It's across the Board, Chris.
Corporate banking, commercial banking, community banking, small business, consumer, credit card; they're all
showing slight improvements in terms of volume and applications. All of them are showing improving in credit quality
and except for commercial real estate, while we see strength on the coasts and the larger cities that kind of line the two
oceans, we don't see any other distinct geography to note, except a nice, steady kind of even increase across all business
lines, across all states where we do business in all 50.
So, we're feeling quite positive about the year as it ages and as spring has sprung, we're looking things -- looking up
pretty nicely. I've got Bill Parker here with me to maybe bring a little more color to the quality and kind of the
application volume estimates.
P.W. Parker, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer
Yeah. So, I'll highlight small business because we did see a pretty good uptick in our small business application
volume. It's been double digit in all of our different areas, whether it's SBA or the branch originated small business. So
that bodes well to see some strength in the small business markets.
And I'll just comment on the credit and commercial real estate, multi-family is the one area that's very strong and
particularly on the coast. And the other areas, Class A properties are highly valued, but if you get below Class A and
the other asset classes, it's still -- I don't want to say weak, but it's not as strong, so -- but overall pretty positive.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
And we won't -- we've said this before, we can't compete on price and we will to the right level, but we won't engage in
price competition where it doesn't make sense for our company. And we won't get our loan volume on lower
underwriting, we simply won't do that and we haven't had to and we're not going to.
Chris Kotowski
Okay. Then the other thing I wanted to ask about was, your mortgage servicing portfolio has started to grow
significantly and it had been flat the prior couple of quarters, in the last two quarters its kind of grown significantly. I
am wondering is that just a function of the strong production volume that we've had recently, or is -- or do you see that
as a particular strategic growth opportunity and as some of the larger players are probably constrained and how they
can grow their servicing business?

Yes and yes. So, it is a function of -- that latter informs the former. So, we are having really nice market share
improvement because we stay very active in this. We've added a lot of resources to continue to be relevant as a
mortgage originator and a servicer and because of the market, dynamics have changed.
We've continued to enjoy even greater growth maybe than we might have thought. We have no limits on the kind of
resources that we might pursue to this level, because we see a market shift that we only get once in a lifetime and we
intend to enjoy it now and come out of this is probably the -- I don't know the top five for sure, mortgage servicing and
production and we're seeing that to come sooner than we thought.
Chris Kotowski
Okay. And specifically that is -- is that something that you could imagine getting in to the kind of standalone mortgage
company kind of business and through acquisition or do you want to maintain mortgage production primarily out of the
branches?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We do it to the branches and to correspond the network. So that's not going to change, but like everything else, we don't
want to be dominant in any one line of business. So, no more that I want to be a credit card company with branches
attached to it, I don't want to be a mortgage company with a credit card business.
We really want to be a business that does the work for most of our customers and meet their needs, where we know
them first hand and where there's opportunity to extend that based on market share and improvement will take that as
well, but Chris you'll see us continue that kind of balance view of revenue achieved through spread and fee income on a
basis of diversity of types of business as well.
Chris Kotowski
Okay, great. That's it for me. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Moshe.
Moshe Orenbuch
Hi, good morning. Could you, maybe kind of flush out some of your comments on the capital front? I mean obviously
you are now kind of -- you passed the point where you would likely see any SIFI buffer, anything like that? And
obviously two-thirds of the capital is a nice capital return, but as you kind of look out there, are there acquisition
opportunities that we should be thinking about or how could that evolve over the course of next year?

Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Moshe, this is Andy. So, our Tier 1 common Basel III standard is at 8.4%, probably a little higher than we would plan
to be at and part of that is the volatility around that ratio as it relates to OCI and the available-for-sale portfolio as we
enjoyed a bigger gain this quarter due to lower interest rates. So you'll see us somewhere in that 8.2 to 8.4 range
depending upon that gain.
Our capital plan was approved and as we've talked about, we have a target of that sort of 30 to 40 dividends, 30 to 40
buybacks somewhere within that range, that leaves us plenty of room for opportunities that present themselves in the
marketplace for portfolio purchases of small deals just like we've done in the past. And I think we're sort of in a normal,
regular ongoing capital distribution methodology as we said today with some dividends, some buybacks and some
return for internal investment.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
And Moshe, what we saw last quarter would be a great proxy for future quarters in terms of M&A, branch
opportunities where they come along, FDIC or otherwise payments business, there is corporate trust opportunity, the
stuff you've seen us do over the last four years, five years. We see a pipeline for that opportunity and as Andy said, we
have plenty of room left within our retained capital to do that.
Moshe Orenbuch
And just a follow-up on the Corporate Trust. I mean there have been some recent lawsuits looking at the questions
around the trustees' responsibility as you know in some of the sub-prime securitizations, do you have kind of any
thoughts on -- as to how that might shake out?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, absolutely. I'm glad you brought up and as you know it's not new. We've been dealing with this for, as long as
I've been here. One of the benefits of Corporate Trust is about -- it's a really good business, particularly when the
market is strong, it's a good relationship and fee business and it provides -- there's pretty high cost of entry. So you're
either in it and you're good or you're not in it at all. We've got the benefit of being in it and good.
But with it comes the risk of confusion, and it's a reputation risk that we manage every single day. And it can be
anything from foreclosed properties, where we are often cited as the owner of the property or our real property where
there is some problem with the quality of the structure. And we're identified as the owner and it turns out most often the
trustee.
And in fact that causes people to be confused, because that's still a complicated topic, when a company might file
bankruptcy and we're acting as trustee, it looks like we were the lender and put them into a bankruptcy. And then more
times than not, as you're talking about now and some of the MBS and other kinds of structured deals, we are often hired
in as the appropriate legal source and the broker between two parties and often confused as the party in between.
So, we will deal with that confusion because the business is so good and it has such a great upside potential. And we're
so deep into it. We just recognized that something we have to manage and each time we get a chance to clarify and
educate either press or civic leaders who are confused about it, we find an opportunity to do so, but it will take quite a
while for people to understand what trustee looks like.
I'll close and give you my pseudo-legal point though that, as a trustee we don't have the rights to reach in and touch the
properties or change the rules of the engagement on the escrow. It's our responsibility to execute as the law would have

Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Matt.
Matthew O'Connor
Hey guys. You've obviously been outgrowing the industry in the loans, you've talked about some NIM pressure going
forward. When you put it all together, do you think you can still grow net interest income dollars from here?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think the short answer to that Matt is yes. So, our NIM pressure was principally related to our increase in our
securities portfolio and that's true on a year-over-year as well as linked quarter basis. We took advantage our long cash
position this quarter to accelerate some of our purchases.
I think we're going to remain fairly stable in the securities portfolio going forward. And we have good amount of debt
at a higher cost rolling off in the second half of the year. So that will create some stabilization. As I mentioned, I expect
us to be down a few basis points in the second quarter, but then I expect some stabilization.
Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Let me also add Matt that, I know this would be the case for everybody but as well as we're doing on loan growth,
we're doing even better in commitment growth and while that doesn't show up in the balance sheet, it shows up in the
future.
And I think you're all going to be very pleased that, whenever the robust economy comes back and it will, we're going
to stand to enjoy a second round of, I think comparative benefit, because the commitment growth is so significant and
yet to be tapped, because our utilization stays flat. We're actually quite optimistic that, to answer your question with a
strong yes.

Okay. And then another topic in terms of buybacks and just capital returns overall, not that I'm looking for a specific
price on which you'll be buying back stock, but you have had some banks come out and say, will be aggressive buyers
up to here, I'm just wondering conceptionally one; how you think about the valuation? And then two; one can make the
argument that, may be special dividends overtime might make more sense. So, how do you just think about balancing
that overtime?
Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Yes Matt, this is Andy. As you know the trade-off with the buyback is buying back the stock at times zero, for the cash
flows at times zero plus one and forward. And we do have a specific view on that. We look at that every month in the
perspective of our company, and we have a very good view on the future.
At this price, we are still buying back our stock and there is a price well above the level we are at today that we would
have consideration of our holding back a bit, but we're not to that level now. So we're very comfortable buying back at
today's price. We're also comfortable with the balance between dividends and buybacks, because it gives us the
opportunity to move in terms of buybacks up or down, given another opportunities in the market place that we talked
about before.
Matthew O'Connor
Okay, thank you very much.

You bet.

Your next question comes from Erika Penala with BoA Merrill Lynch.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Erika.
Erika Penala
Good morning. My first question is on home equity classification on the credit side. I know this is a much smaller piece
of your pie, but we saw some larger banks, an increase in problem loans as they reclassified some of their seconds that
are still paying as the forces in trouble. Did you stick to that cost or did you also stick to that same classification this
quarter or is that already reflected in your numbers?

Page 11 of 27
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Erika I'm going to have Bill answer the technical issue, but for us I just want to highlight is very, very small. And, the
numbers that you've seen from some of the larger banks are significantly greater than so for us, we're talking $15
million to $30 million, well below the billion plus dollars that you've seen elsewhere.
And so for us, we believe that the classification we have today is accurate and reflects appropriately. We did do some
actions last quarter that Bill can talk about. But I'll also say that if we discovery that there is a prevailing view on how
things should be handled, then we can do that.
But, if you look at our non-performing loans, they improve by almost 8% linked quarter. If we were taking that 15
million to 30 million, they would have improved by 7%. So just to reiterate, the immateriality of it and the fact that it's
not a big number is important for me to highlight and Bill, you might take a little, deeper diver.
P.W. Parker, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer
Yeah. So, I mean if our home equity portfolio has two distinguishing features; one, a lot of it is about 5 billion of it is
actually lined sort of in the first lean position. So, there is not even another loan to look at. So obviously that's very
high quality, and then those that we do service about 30% of the portfolio that's where that 15 million, 30 million
comes from, so it's just not a material number. The other part of what that reclassification was about, was really on the
reserving side and that's I'd argue the more important side and we've implemented that sometime last year. So we feel
very comfortable over the adequacy of our reserves on home equity.
Erika Penala
Okay. And just to view in to another topic. Richard, could you give us a sense or an update on your ability to reprice
the deposit product in 2012 on the retail side? I know a lot of banks had talked about mitigation efforts sort of in this
first half of last year in anticipation of that would interchange reform. And just wanted to get a sense on, how some of
the fee transfer to the consumer is panning out this year?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Erika. We've said that, of the total loss of revenue that was derived by Card Act, Reg E and Durbin that we
would eventually get 50% of that back and I think we -- 30% last time. Our plan is to get to that 50% by year's end and
I also said, it won't be before year's end, because we're going to be very thoughtful about this. But I'm comfortable we
can do it.
And in doing so, there is couple of things. One is market share gain, really helps a lot. You can improve your fee
revenue by just having more customers who are paying the current due that you offer and feel good about that, with our
checking with choice and some other where we have packaged our products, people are seemingly happy to pay those
fees and get the services that we provide, especially some of the things we're adding to the capabilities like mobile and
more technology.
I would say however, there will also be some increases in certain fee categories that we will continue to provide
because we need to do that to return to the shareholders what they've been waiting for. We have to be very thoughtful
about market positions and we are not one site that's all, we have basically business in every state, we have 25 states
where our consumer businesses located, and if we have to have a 168 different solutions for that many different pricing
markets which is how many we have, we would do that.
So, we're going to be very careful and thoughtful and look at where the market competition will allow us to increase the
currencies. And we're really going to -- after with some market share grab and continue to have more customers to pay

what we think is a fair assessment for this service we have provide.
Nothing magic, and what I did say is, we will get to that 50% or use the whole year to get there, I'm not rushing it.
We've got a good momentum everywhere else, I'm not going to mess up what's happening right now and the good
momentum we have in the branches, where they're getting more customers, deeper relationships and now putting them
through the business starts of having to decide what prices we change all the time, because we're very consistent and I
want to give them that benefit.

Your next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, John.
John McDonald
Hi. Good morning. Just a broader question. You guys are executing -- profitability ratios within the targeted ranges,
kind of wondering where do you think you're still under earning, whether it's low interest rates or mitigating some of
the reg reform, where are the areas that you can improve the profitability in the next couple of years?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, this is the best part of the story. And I mean the best past of this story is that, we're just still not finished, but
getting greater what we would like to do. So, harder it is to talk about organic growth and pursue our investments from
prior period, that's really what the story is all about.
And in fact John, the reason quarter one 2012 was as good as it was, was because the things we did in third quarter
2010 and the commitments we're making through employee engagement and technology. So I would tell you, we hit
our peak in capital investments in 2010, but we'll have to continue to work that off.
Our investments in the first five years, 2001 to 2006 were 45%, less than they were in the last five years of 2006 to
2011. So, we have spent quite a bit of money with your all knowledge and permission to re-invest in the company, and
that's starting to show up in capital.
Acquisitions are all accretive, most of the time on day one and I think those continue to show us beneficial. But this last
part is organic growth, and I know it's so unexciting to talk about, but it's exactly what's happening here. And so from
wealth management and building out to become a national first-class wealth manager, to adding our new Ascent,
ultra-high network business which is only a couple of quarters old to this amazing build-out you've seen us take to a
national level on our corporate banking capability and then adding our payment skills across the globe and our

consumer and retail banks and small business now taking all together new levels of performance, add it all up, that's
what you get.
So, I think on top of that, a start market that's actually -- kind of flattish and interest rates which we all know are, as
well as are going to be, we've got upside on every single cylinder, and if this is an eight cylinder car, we're running at
about 4.5 right now. So if you're likely to see now, just wait till, all things start getting better. I think there is nothing
but upward bias toward what we can do the old fashion organically.
John McDonald
Okay, thanks Richard, that's helpful. Maybe a question for Bill. Where are you on the kind of cycle of reserve release
and how do you see that playing out over the next couple of quarters? And then also, if you could just comment, what
drove the higher reserve built for the rep and warranty, is that due to higher origination volume or something else?
Thanks.
P.W. Parker, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer
Yeah. So the reserve release, I mean we're in the point of the credit cycle where we'll continue to get credit
improvement probably for another 18 months. We have commercial real estate asset that still need to be resolved and
that's going to take some time and some of the residential mortgage portfolios are still stressed. So that's going to take
time, but the improvement is slowing, I mean some of our portfolios are performing extremely good credit levels; credit
cards, autos doing extremely well.
So you're not going to see a lot more improvement in those areas. So, I think that the reserve release has something that
will -- it will continue but at a lower level, it will continue to decline.
Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
And John, this is Andy regarding the mortgage question. The principal reason for that was the recent changes from the
GSEs in terms of increasing their sampling size. So I would not expect a significantly higher quarter-to-quarter loss
rate, but perhaps a longer or more extended period and that's why we have a higher reserve level.
John McDonald
Okay. Thanks, Andy.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey John, I'll just add because god knows I've got to speak, and you guys -- I want to remind you that, as you saw our
charge-offs at a level of 1.09%, we've said all of you for a long time, that over this cycle, this is a probably 1%
charge-off bank, especially because of our credit card size. We're heading that 1% by being close to it.
And I predict we'll go below it and my goal is to do our best to make sure that our reserves within accounting rules stay
to a place we don't have to rebuild the mall back later on. As an industry arguing for that as well, because I think we've
learned a lesson and we don't want to do that.
But you have to appreciate that I think Bill and I both think that 1.09 goes to 1 and probably falls under that for a little
while, not as a goal necessarily but over the time and then in term of our long history, we think that we'll get 1% and
we're getting very close to that.

Okay. And then one just follow up for Andy. To the extent there is a nuance change in the GSE sampling behavior. Is
that them looking at a wider range of industries Andy or putting, trying to put back stuff that's been pain for longer, any
color on that?
Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Its just, John going deeper in the loans that we're looking at and going back further. So it's deeper and further in terms
of sampling size. There is going to be -- the more you look at, the more you may buy in and that's why we increased the
reserve.

Hi Ed.

Good morning guys.

Good morning.

Questions sort of asked but I'm going to ask in a slightly different way. So you're 109 basis points in the charge-off
ratio this quarter and have given that long-term guidance of 1%. Richard you said in prior calls, you expected the dip
below that 1% level that sort of looks likely now for next year.
Any thoughts as to how far you might dip below that level as you sort of continue to clean-up credit and we see this big
decline that we're seeing now again this quarter in the delinquency trends, I mean could we go down to 70 or 80 basis
points at some point?

Page 15 of 27
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I mean Ed, I don't know where we end up. When I say under one, I just want you all to know that it's probably going to
be -- it's going to over perform for a little while there. It could be 90 basis points, could be high 80s, and it's not going
to be 50 or anything like that.
We're still making loans, we're still taking calculated risks and we want us to do that. But we're also not -- what I'm also
telegraphing to you is, we're not going to start reaching into riskier categories, we're not going to start underwriting
more aggressively. We are not worried about protecting our position as one of the larger market share growers in the
credit and we're doing it the way we're doing it, and we're not going to change.
So I'm also telegraphing to you that, we're not expecting it to get so pristine that you think we're missing opportunities.
But I do thing this is a high quality book, the stress test we would have said so, each time they do it and I think you
guys should be comfortable that, if we fall below 1%, it's not a goal, it happens to be an outcome, but our goals is to
manage this company right around 1% because that we think is the right level of risk and reward.
Edward Najarian
Okay thanks. And then secondarily if I add back the repurchase provision on mortgage side, I think I am getting to a
mortgage gain on sale, sort of gross number of about 230 basis points on the production. First of all, is that about, you
agree with that? And then second of all, what are your thoughts on how long that can last or the pace that might decline
over what timeframe or we all know that's a very wide number, but I think we're all struggling with how quickly and
over what timeframe that declines?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Ed, so you know that the production gain is based on net applications, net of our projected follow-up number. So it's
closer to 200 basis points in terms of the map. And it is why then I would expect it to continue in forward quarters, but
we are enjoying a robust business in our mortgage group as we talked about, we're talking share and we're expanding
our capability. So I would expect it -- second quarter to have another strong quarter in mortgage and I -- it's hard for me
to see beyond that right now because there is just too much uncertainty out there.
Edward Najarian
But, at least for the second quarter, it looks like another quarter in terms of very wide gain on sales spread?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Our pipelines continue to be strong. There might be some slowdowns just given the, about 75% of our first quarter
activity was refinance activity. I would expect that to slow somewhat, given that rates have stabilized, but the pipeline
continues to be strong.
Edward Najarian
Right, but that's more of a comment on volume, I'm talking about the gain on sales spread?

Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Ken Usdin
Hey good morning everyone. Two quick questions on loans. Number one, commercial real estate is an area that's
started to grow again a little bit for you guys. And just wanted to understand, how much of that is still moving over
from the C and D book versus opportunities that you are starting to see in the marketplace? How fiery you're looking as
far as maybe in the next part of the loan book to pick up and where are you guys in terms of your aggressiveness in that
market?
P.W. Parker, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer
Thanks. This is Bill. It's not really moving over from the construction and development, that continues to decline. So
the growth we've been picking up is more in stabilized properties. And there are going to be Class A properties, lot of
them with our institutional investors. We have a pretty high quality group of clientele that our commercial real estate
group has enjoyed many years of performance -- and that's where we pick up the loan growth.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah in fact Ken it's Richard. It's unremarkable and where it's coming from is remarkable, is coming from everywhere.
And I think also the build out of our corporate bank capabilities as you've been hearing about last couple of years, make
us more of a one stop shop for some of these larger real estate national companies that have used us now for higher
positions, allowed us to be in the deals longer, have used us for capital market capabilities.
So for us that's just like I said in beginning, everywhere it's a little bit of every category and I think it's -- to call you
that we continue to enjoy that, I don't know how long that last, but every time we get to talk to you, it's is still there and
we'll enjoy it until it's not.
Ken Usdin
Great. And my second question just relates to just loan pricing. Obviously yields came down a little bit in both C&I and
CRE. Just one, if you had some anecdotal to share in terms of how you see loan pricing across the markets and across
the commercial products?

that continues to be the case in the first quarter. There are pockets of increased competition particularly in the
commercial area and maybe a little bit below that, but overall commercial wholesale launch spreads are stable.

Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.
Paul Miller
Yeah. Thank you very much. I had a quick follow-up question on the push backs. You talked about increased sample
size from the GSE, the change in policy. Can you just add some more color to that?
P.W. Parker, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer
I don't know how to define it, other than they are looking at more loans, both in the respect of the depth of the
categories as well as the timeframe. So if they were looking at 10 loans before, they're looking at 12 now for whatever
period and that's it. So, we applied a similar expectation on that increased sample size, it could be that the increased
sample size will result in actually a lower loss expectation, we just don't know until we get through the data.
Paul Miller
Okay and thanks a lot. And then on the loan portfolio, which has grown very nicely for you guys. But one of the areas
that has grown is residential, and I think part of that's probably because of your market share increase in the mortgage
banking space. Is that mainly jumbo loans or is any of that -- your confirming product?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. There is definitely jumbo that primarily comes through our product client channels. So we do book those jumbo
loans that are not GSE qualified. And then the other area of origination is our branches and we have -- it's a refined
product only. The average loan size is less than 100,000 is low loan to value, first mortgage, refinance originations out
of our branch. So, those are the two main categories.
P.W. Parker, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer
And those are likely to have life of 10 or 15 years.

lot of stuff that HARP is better than the expectations and as April 1st I believe, banks like you can start to pick at other
servicing portfolios with somewhat limited reps and warrants. So I just wondered, are you going to continue to try to
take market share and maybe grab to some of these loans and other portfolios?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, first I'll just kind of that our HARP volume has been pretty strong. We had about a 47% application increase
quarter-over-quarter. So, we have seen good HARP refile production. It's hard to say how aggressive will be ongoing
after the other people's business, I mean we've been very active in our own portfolio and we'll continue to be active in
our own portfolio. That's our first priority.
Paul Miller
Okay. Great, guys. Thank you very much.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

be typical? And again why is it greater than average, it's not just you, it's the whole industry.

Typically Mike, it could be somewhere between 125 in one in quarter. It's higher right now because there are so much
demand in the marketplace, and there is a fairly healthy pipeline. And the number of suppliers in the marketplace is
down. So, it's just a function of supplying demand in the current market and that gives us some pricing opportunity.
Mike Mayo
And did you mean 125 to 150 is normal?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, correct.
Mike Mayo
Okay. And who're you getting share from, in your pursuit to be the top five?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We are already there actually, I was just being generous. We're taking it from the large, some of the larger guys, there
is just a couple of large banks that are backing it down on that business, and just not - energy into resources. And then
on the other side, there are some smaller partners that are getting out of the business and looking like they are trading.
So, it's exact what you seem like - but you know who is going to - and who is growing - it's either backing down or not
very present in -- we're getting it from there.
Mike Mayo
And then switching to your corporate banking build-out. You've talked a lot about, but when I look linked quarter,
period end commercial loans, where that commercial leases are up 18% annualized. And we can look at average and
average of 15% annualized, how we want to slice it, that's a big number. And my question relates to, how much of that
growth is due to syndicated lending and how much of that growth is due to purchases of loans?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we are I mean in the larger corporate space. You're going to be active in the syndicated market and that
complements our corporate bond issuance area. So, that is a piece of it, but we're also active in the middle market. So,
our middle market group is included in those statistics we have, ABL unit that's enjoyed nice growth. So it's really
across the Board.
Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
And Mike, we haven't done much to buy. We're not big acquirers of somebody else's loans. There have been a couple
of deals we've looked at. We passed on almost everything that you see in the public market. And if there is real growth
-- a loan or two, it will have to mostly be a customer we already know and at a position of whole level, willing to take,
but it's not a growth strategy for us to go acquire portfolios. If we come along, we'll look at everything, but we're not as
hungry for some of those deals as some others are.

Mike Mayo
And then lastly, as you pointed out, your profitability ratios are within your targeted range. Are you leaving money on
the table by not having a greater variety of capital market features to give your clients especially with your corporate
banking build up?
Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
No. And I say that because, we like, the only view that we understand and that we can control and -- sounds, I really
like the consistent, predictable receivable business we've given you all. I thought you were going to ask, if we're going
to stop at 16 and 1.6 and that will be no way either, are you kidding.
But we love what we are, because I think you can count on it and you can, it's an annuity and you can watch it grow
and you can watch it adjust if you don't see any big surprises and adding to some of those additional opportunities are
not hurting us at all, because we've got all the ones we wanted to in the last few years by building out a wholesale bank
and capital markets. Nothing less we have covered, there is nothing we don't have that we want and there is nothing we
have now that we don't want to keep. So, what you see is, what you're going to get supply well?
Mike Mayo
Alright. Thank you.

Yes.

Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
You know Nancy, this is Andy. The only one I -- that I know we're all watching is the final LCR ratio. There is a
definition out there today, I know there is some discussion occurring with Basel and the Fed in terms of potential
adjustments to that.
Nancy Bush
Right.
Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
We've built a lot of liquidity on balance sheet and whatever those final ratios are will guide us to whatever we finalize
from the securities portfolio, but that would be the only one that I can think of.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Nancy I was about to say, no I don't think so. I'm not giving the -- But let me say what I would characterize, between
Volcker, Dodd-Frank, CFPB, as it relates to the financial impacts to our company and the shareholders, substantially
most of that has already been seen by those other activities of Reg E and Durbin and Card Act and things like that.
Now, it will change the course of how we run the company, because we'll have to maybe Dodd horizon -- price. We'll
have to confirm certain behaviors. We built our capital markets business knowing that the Volcker rules were going to
change. Dodd-Frank adjust, probably 65% of Dodd-Frank will touch our company and a big majority of it's going to be
more people work, transactions and managing the details but not the financials.
And CFPB, I remain optimistic that there hasn't been anything I haven't seen yet, just to argue with and we're watching
how they perform but, I think if their original, true goal is being transparent, clear and helping customers understand
what they bought, we're going to be in great shape there, get into those things like price fixing and things like that, then
we'll do with that when we -- in, it will affect everybody and as unusual, probably affect us well.
But for now, I think we're -- the management team keeping eye on so many things but not sitting here worrying about
the apparel that will trade for the investment that you guys have in our company. And if it's a -- we'll manage it like we
have the form of -- offset.
Nancy Bush
So you think the regulatory regime as we see it right now is pretty much what we get going forward?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think the details are -- I mean yeah, I've got the canvas, I see the pain on the size I know it's -- yet, but I don't
think there is a hidden door that, of any significance that we can at least predict or work with them as the next couple of
years go up, forward. But as you know, I mean Dodd-Frank want 25% to 33% done, Volcker has got lot of TBDs and
CFPB's new. So last thing is -- known or done, but I'm telling you what I think, its worst case scenarios are something
we can manage.

And Richard would you care to make an intrepid prediction about when you might get the ability to make or to decide
capital actions without going through CCAR, et cetera, et cetera. I mean are we at a point now over the next several
years, where capital actions are done once a year, based upon the results of the CCAR or is that going to change?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Nancy, I really don't have any thoughts around it to offer. But I would say, we're going to learn a couple of things this
year, because we know there are couple of our peers that are seeking mid-year capital allocation based on what they
didn't get in the CCAR.
And I think that will -- us because we have no evidence there will be anything less than annual activity. And then I also
embedding, that it will take a few more years, few meeting more than one or two for the global regulators to believe
that banks can manage themselves without oversight.
I think the stress test is an annual event that makes sense and as long as the rules are understood and we know how to
participate in predicting our own outcome and make our own decisions that are hopefully approved, I don't think it
becomes a burden at all, but one that we also tell the extra steps that we had before. But I think in terms of annual
nature, I think we're to learn that this year, as some of our folks for mid-year correction.

Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Betsy Graseck
Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on the commitments you called up 5% Q-on-Q gross in CRE and C&I. I am
just wondering, you've been having nice commitment growth for a while now. How long does the commitments take to
translate in to outstandings?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, currently forever. I mean really our commitment levels -- just to give you an idea, when I gave you 25%, this for
the large corporate and middle market clients. So it's not credit cards, not consumers not even small businesses.
Back in 2009, that was 37%, right. So 37% of $65 million was used as a line of credit. In the last quarter, we had 25%
or $90 billion. So, while the growth -- the actual loans outstanding are virtually flat, the increase in the outstanding
open to buy is remarkable. So, I got to say in a recession, it really is, I have no idea how long it will take. But what I
know is, when it happens, will be amazingly quick. And you guys can watch us like a doppler radar.
The first when it happens, when company start getting ready to move as the cash balances get used. And then a line of
credit gets used and then new loans are made. And so, we are still at record levels of deposits held, based on company
being strong enough right now and kind of -- bidding cash until they know what to do with it.

And that's the first, I think scenario in the mind that does, no one is actually taking any big steps at this point in time.
But they are getting those lines of credit, but the -- primary use of license I suspect is a -- given a lot of alternatives and
I think the country business community is much stronger than people think it is, because they are cash rich, they are
line of credit capable and they're ready to jump when funding comes along. We just need that trigger of management, I
don't see it in the near term, but surely will happen because it's a cycle.
Betsy Graseck
Okay. I see the macro numbers in your release I just wondered if, you in tracking individual companies that you are
extending equipments to, is that translating into loan growth at all over the last year or so? And I guess your answer is
not yet.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Not yet, and it's a good question, because I thought -- I would tell you if that 25% was -- a few companies that are
100% and the rest at zero, that would be an information but it's not, it's the average company has a line of credit and
uses a part of it and then the rest -- open to buy. And so for us, this represents a behavior consistency but an absolute
growth opportunity.
Betsy Graseck
Thanks.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Greg.
Greg Ketron
Good morning. Just a couple of questions. One, the post commercial loan growth continued at very impressive pace.
And maybe some color, it looks like you would be gaining market share and maybe some color on the strategies that
you're undertaking to approach the wholesale or commercial lending business?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, this is Richard. Good morning. Here comes somethings else that sounds not that exciting. We work on efficacy
and we've been trading all of our lenders, many of them have been doing this for thirty years. On special training
program that we created here in our company, on customer efficacy and that is great code work for building deeper

relationships and having the entire company available informationally to a customer we needed them.
So we're not -- we don't have the relationship manager, we're now calling on a line of credit, talking about line of
credit, bring for a line of credit and coming back home. This relationship manager is working with an entire team
during pre-call activities, bringing the right people out to the client, selling the entire company if not now, later and
getting a lot of market from other places.
So, the relationship depth we have is essentially higher than it was before. And the answer to your question about 45
minutes ago, amazingly still infant in its growth opportunity. So, what we're doing now is just getting started in a new
way of taking market share. Our guys figured out, despite the quality is a real deal, it translates to new business, so
telling the story better, helps us to do a better job and so it's really training and making the entire company available to
every relationship manager. That totally wasn't going to sound exciting but I'll say what is a big deal and it's a big
change moreover few years ago.
Greg Ketron
This has legs that could run for beyond next couple of quarters...
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
That's right.
Greg Ketron
Okay.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
This is has years of legs, because its got nothing but upside and again if you like what you see now, just imagine what
we can do when really get good at it.
Greg Ketron
Right. And Andy a question for you on the margin. On the liability side, what remaining opportunities do you have
such as maybe debt restructuring or elimination that may help support the margin through the rest of this year?
Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
We have a some TGLP paper coming up here in the May-June timeframe and in total, if you think about the second
half of the year, another $7 billion to $9 billion of higher cost debt rolling off. Some of which will be placed, some of
which will be sort of re-substituted with deposit growth that we're enjoying. So, that benefit will start to show in margin
in the second half.
Greg Ketron
Okay. So, you'll see cost coming out of that -- what we've replaced with lower cost of funding sources?

Our final question comes from Chris Gamaitoni with Compass Point.
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Chris.
Chris Gamaitoni
Hi, good morning. I had two questions. One around deposits, non-interest bearing deposits look like they decline about
5% quarter-over-quarter and that looks to be mostly in these community bank, small Community Bank segment. Can
you just give a little color around that, is that appeal becoming more comfortable on -- spend and thinking about the
current position?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I would attribute it more a bit to seasonality, typical seasonality related to tax activity and just first quarter spend. So, I
don't think there is so much of a decline or utilization as much as the seasonal impacts.
Chris Gamaitoni
Okay. And then on the deposit service accounts -- they were down 10% to 10.5% quarter-over-quarter, was attributed
to seasonality. I haven't seen the same trends across other banks. Is there a geography issue or a business change that's
impacting that?
Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
There is no geography issue, there are fewer days, business days in the first quarter than the fourth quarter and that's the
principal reason for decline in the key driver of that number.

Thank you guys for your continued support. The questions were great and they helped us clarify what's on your mind.
I'd also ask you to remain optimistic about this economy, I mean it's starting to show some real signs of permanent,
slow recovery and we're going to be watching every step of it being -- part of it and hopefully the banks in America
will get little more credit for the kind of good work we're going to do to help America back on speed. So, it's not a good
