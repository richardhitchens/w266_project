MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2015 Financial Results
Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the
Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please, go ahead.
Phil Hardin
Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We
will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 28, 2016,
only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about
factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the
SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage

you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on
the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this
webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures
regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of
2014.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Brian T. Olsavsky
Thanks, Phil. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow
increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases
increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property
and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases
reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure,
the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483
million shares one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion
unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million.
Excluding customers, who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts
were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide
paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment
by Amazon or FBA units represented nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers
exceeded 1 million.
Now, I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of
revenue, compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or
27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue,
compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7
billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 5.1%.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to
report North America, International and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to our
segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion, or 12%
excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was
$1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment
operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the International segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable
foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%.

Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion, or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to
$8.5 billion, or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million compared
with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact
from foreign exchange.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating
income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS
segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points
year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.
GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was
$482 million, or $1 per diluted share compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes
in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in
foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign
exchange. Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%, Japan revenue grew
19% and U.K. revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion.
Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points
year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was
$2.2 billion compared with $178 million in the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion.
Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion and inventory turns were 8.5 turns, down from 8.6 turns a year ago as we
expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24%
to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year.
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've
seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently
unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding
exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict
demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies
among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a
material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions,
investments, restructurings or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and
that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion, or growth of between 17% and 28%. This
guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates; GAAP
operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million compared with $255 million in first quarter 2015.
This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We
anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating
expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015.
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe
putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's
move on to questions.

Phil Hardin
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how
to initiate a question?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question's coming from analyst Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Okay, thanks. So, Brian, I think in the past you've given some indication as to what usage growth
may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter. And secondarily, is there any way
to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. I will say it's been
very strong, and the AWS revenue is just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4. As far as pricing is concerned
we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years
ago. And generally what we find is that price is important but so is speed and agility for customers, and the ability to
deliver services and features that are beneficial to them.
I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015, and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel
we have a lead in this space and we don't take it for granted. And we want to serve customers better each year.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from analyst Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jason S. Helfstein>: Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics in fourth quarter e-commerce,
particularly in the U.S.? Did we see more aggressive promotional activity? And maybe talk about how you try to work
that to continue to drive the Prime number of members going forward? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sure. Well, what I can say is our approach to pricing has not changed and through Q4 we
did everything we could to have the best prices available for customers and in stock in time for the holiday. Another
dynamic of Q4 was that it was a huge FBA quarter. Nearly 50% of our third-party units were FBA and our third-party
units were also up to 47% of our paid units, so up 400 basis points year-over-year. So a really strong quarter for our
FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses and we were full. It was a very
dizzy quarter and it did increase some of our variable costs as a result, primarily in the U.S. But a very strong quarter
for FBA. It exceeded even our expectations.
<Q - Jason S. Helfstein>: Perhaps how you were able to integrate that into holiday promotions?
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: I'm sorry, you cut off there. Can you repeat your question?
<Q - Jason S. Helfstein>: Sure. Just any additional color around Prime and how you were able to integrate that into
holiday promotions?
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Nothing specific. I will say one interesting enhancement this year was our Prime Now
service, which allowed people to order in selected markets up till 11:59 p.m. on Christmas Eve. So that was a valuable
service to many late shoppers, last minute shoppers.

Thank you. Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Aram Rubinson>: Hey, thanks very much. Two questions both on the logistics side. It seems pretty clear that
you guys are trafficking in some old world assets, like truck trailers and ship lanes and airfields. Can you help give us a
sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish with that? If it's defensive to protect your service to your existing
customers or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets?
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sure, Aram. Thanks for your question. I would say that what we've found is in order to
properly serve our customers at peak, we've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing
partners. That's not meant to replace them. And those carriers are just no longer able to handle all of our capacity that
we need at peak. They've been and continue to be great partners and we look forward to working with them in the
future. It's just we've had to add some resources on our own.
You mentioned trucks. The Amazon trucks, we did invest in those this past year. We use those primarily for movement
between our warehouses and our sort centers.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one is just on gross margins. I think they
were down about 200 basis points sequentially. It's the biggest fall in the fourth quarter in quite some time. Anything
you can call out there? Is it devices or more sortation centers? Is there anything pressuring gross margins we should
think about in the fourth quarter? And then on the fulfillment line, you mentioned FBA being a big driver of the growth
in the fulfillment costs. Anything else you would call out leading to incremental fulfillment costs, maybe India or
something else? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: No. And again, keep in mind that the fulfillment as a percent of revenue is impacted by the
calculation of FBA revenue being a net number as opposed to a full revenue number. But our fulfillment cost per unit
actually decreased year-over-year. It's just we are now shipping more and more of the demand out of our warehouses
because of the strength in retail and FBA.
On gross margin, first I'll caution you and say we'd encourage you to look at free cash flow, which grew a minimum $4
billion on each of the metrics that we point out. And op profit, which was up 88% year-over-year. If you look
sequentially, also keep in mind that in Q3 when it was up about 500 basis points year-over-year, that was lapping the
write-down of our Amazon phone inventory the prior year. So there's a little bit of noise in the Q3 number.
But generally, again, we're happy with the ability to service customers, the reaction of customers in Q4 and the bottom
line results that we had.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Great, thanks. One follow-up and then another question. On the logistics and transportation
side, I was curious if that's to date just to supplement some of the other carriers? But more broadly or longer-term is
there an ambition from the services side to perhaps provide capacity to other companies?
And then on AWS margins, I was just wondering if we should expect more leverage there going forward? And whether
Q1 – whether that should demonstrate some seasonality versus what we've seen in terms of sequential growth in prior

years? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sure, let me work backwards. Don't give guidance by segment, so I cannot really comment
on AWS specifically in Q1. And the operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been
heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase productions and purchase prices and also efficiency in driving
greater utilization of the assets that we have. So we're very happy with that.
Keep in mind that although the year-over-year increase in capital expenditures and capital leases was not as great as we
saw in 2013 to 2014, we did spend over $9 billion on those capital expenditures and capital lease obligations, up from
prior year it was, excuse me.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question...
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sorry, let me finish my answer to him, please. We grew from in the $5 billion range in 2013
to $8.9 billion in 2014, and now over $9 billion in 2015.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ken Sena>: Hi. So a lot of headlines around Amazon's activity at Sundance, and I just was hoping you could
maybe expand once more on the video strategy? And specifically are you seeing an inflection in Prime Video usage?
And maybe just also on your Streaming Partners Program, what the general reception is like? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sure. We're very thrilled with the customer response to Prime Video. Again, when Prime
Video is used by our Prime members, it drives adoption and retention, higher free trial conversion rates and higher
renewal rates for subscribers. So what we were encouraged by in Q4 was that globally, our Prime members doubled the
number of viewing hours of the Prime Video year-over-year. And internationally we had twice as many Prime
members streaming year-over-year; so very encouraged by the pickup and the response of customers.
The other comment I would say about video is we're very happy with the Amazon Studios content in particular. We had
some great success in 2014 and 2015. As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple Golden Globes and
Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself. Mozart in the Jungle just won two Golden Globe Awards; so very, very
pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content.
And we've got a lot of new content coming out this year. Catastrophe Season 2, Bosch Season 2, we're all looking
forward to. And in February, we will have Chi-Raq, our first original movie that we got to work with Spike Lee on,
which made many Critics' Best Films lists in 2015. That'll be coming to Prime Video in February.
<A - Phil Hardin>: Just to add to that. This is Phil. On your question about the Streaming Partners Program, so that's
our new over-the-top streaming subscription program for Prime members. We think it's a really convenient way for
them to access additional content from sources like Showtime and Starz. And it's really early so it's just out of the gate,
but we've been very pleased with what we've seen so far.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Mark Mahaney>: Two things, please. Any callouts on the macro side? Occasionally, you've called things out,
anything this time? And then can you talk a little bit about Amazon Business? I know there's a little bit of a line in the

press release on it. I know you've had this for a couple of years, but any indications to the materiality of that? The kind
of momentum it's gaining, the kind of traction it's gaining? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. No macroeconomic comments. Again, we're very
encouraged by the customer response to our offerings in Q4. Amazon Business, yes, in April you may remember we
launched it as a marketplace with specific features and benefits for businesses. That Amazon Business now serves more
than 200,000 businesses from small organizations to Fortune 500 companies. So it's still early, but we're encouraged
and we think we're creating a lot of value for our Business customers.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks. Brian, question on the International retail business. I think you added well over $1
billion in revenue year-on-year in the quarter, but from a CSOI perspective you really didn't see any improvement
there. I'm sure there are a lot of different things going on. I just wonder if you could unpack that a little bit and give us
a sense of what profitability looks like, maybe in some of your more mature or established countries and regions
relative to the investments you're making in other countries, so that we can kind of get a better picture of what's
actually going on under the hood there. Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Yes, sure, Mark. Thanks for your question. We are very pleased by the International growth.
22% FX neutral was up 1,000 basis points year-over-year. We told you that the Prime membership growth above 51%
globally. 47% in the U.S. means that the International Prime programs grew at a faster clip than that. So very, very
pleased with the uptick. We rolled out a lot of additional Prime features internationally as well this year, from FREE
Same-Day to Prime Now to Prime Music and Prime Video in Japan, to name a few. So, we're very happy with that.
But in general if I step back, our investments in national are twofold. First, there's the Prime platform and all the
features that I just mentioned, including adding more fulfillment resources to handle higher and higher retail volumes
and a very strong FBA program as well. And then the biggest other investment area's obviously India and we like what
we continue to see – we like what we see in India. In Q4, Amazon India was the top e-commerce site in India
throughout the very busy Diwali shopping season, including the shopping season, according to comScore. And sales by
sellers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined in Q4. So we're seeing great progress with downloads, innovations
for sellers and customers alike. And we like the ramp that we're continuing to invest in India.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thanks for taking my question. Two things; just first on the North America EGM growth,
if you could just talk about the 28% there, and the decel on an easier comp and whether there's any particular factors
within that we should be thinking about? And perhaps if there's any weather and apparel impact there?
And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something along the lines of being able to
invest as you'd like and also deliver good profit and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as it has in the
past. Does that statement and thought still hold as you head into 2016? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sure, let me start with EGM. So, North America EGM growth of 28% was actually also the
highest in the last four years. So we're happy with that. The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a
function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that
Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate – revenue growth rate.

So sequentially last year, any North America EGM we dropped from 31% to 27%. This year it's 35% to 28%, so there's
always generally a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly, very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well as
total customer satisfaction.
Your other question, investments, yes. We continue to have healthy investments, as we've stated, across the globe. To
step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find businesses that customers love, that can grow to be
large, will provide strong financial returns and are durable, that can last for decades. We think Prime is that, we think
Marketplace is that, we think AWS is that and we're constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that
criteria.
But as we continue to invest, primarily as I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion
for fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance and much greater FBA share and
not to mention all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies in fixed and variable
productivity. I think a thing to think about is the investments will ebb and flow over time but our focus on cost
reductions and improvement on customer experience will be constant.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Heath Patrick Terry>: Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense, as we look at the slowing
growth in AWS obviously still from an incredibly high level and still very strong growth there. But try and take that
into context with the growth in margins that you keep seeing in that business to levels that certainly seem a lot higher
than you would anticipate for an Amazon Business. Is there any capacity constraint or management that's driving
pricing strategy in AWS? We've heard the comments about the number of availability zones that are being launched
this year, which is obviously about a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business, I'm just trying to balance
those. Think about how we should balance those three things?
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sure. Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We just announced
Korea as a region and we'll be adding five more regions in the near future, as we've mentioned.
CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures, particularly in AWS.
And we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, as I
mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014 and grew even more to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and
capital leases in 2015.
From the new regions, they're not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in
AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth. But there's certainly expenditures when we
open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the regions. So we've spent a good bit on
those new regions already in 2015.
But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint. And I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment. Yes, on a
percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3. But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business.
On a dollar basis, we saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and again we continue to invent,
it's not all about price. We continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great customer response.
<Q - Heath Patrick Terry>: Sure, sure. Got it. Thank you.

<Q - Kerry Rice>: Thanks a lot. First question is if you can provide maybe some context around linearity within Q4,
more as compared to your expectations? Obviously, you have a ramp-up into the holiday season, but did December tail
off faster than you expected or did the ramp up spike higher than you expected? And then just on the follow-up, maybe
can you add some context about how the mobile played a role in the holiday season for Amazon? Thanks.
<A - Phil Hardin>: This is Phil. In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4. And if
you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue. So, no real callouts
there, I think. What was the second part of your question?
Oh, and mobile, we've said for a long time, continues to be a tailwind for the business. We're working very hard to
make sure that it's very easy for customers to buy the things they want to buy and access a lot of the features that
they've grown accustomed to on the website. And so we're very focused on the convenience factor. And if you look at
some of our new offerings like Prime Now, that's available through a mobile app and very convenient for customers,
and as Brian's mentioned, allow them to shop even up to Christmas Eve and have their items delivered in two hours.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Thank you. I have two. I want to go back to AWS margins. You talked briefly about
purchasing and asset utilization, but does this explain the 800 bps or so year-on-year margin expansion? And are you
seeing anything else, like is there any impact of scale driving leverage over fixed cost? Is there some benefit from
revenue mix shift like services like Aurora and Redshift growing faster than EC2 or is all the margin expansion due to
purchasing and asset utilization? So that's the first question.
And the second, I have a question about your streaming content expenses, or cost of revenues to be more precise. Last
year you told us they were $1.3 billion, but you didn't give us a figure for 2015. In lieu of that, can you comment on
whether 4Q saw higher than usual cost for streaming content compared to the other quarters in the year? Thank you.
<A - Phil Hardin>: Carlos, this is Phil. So your question about the AWS margins, that business, as they continue to
learn and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been
able to drive cost out of that business. And so that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you see in
margin year-over-year. There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter,
which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars but have
assets with local currency costs throughout the world.
As for the streaming content, we haven't given another update this year and haven't given any commentary on the
profile quarter-to-quarter.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Thank you. You mentioned Amazon Dash in the press release. Can you give us some color
around how you're viewing the traction there, both with customers and with brands and devices? And then maybe any
update on Twitch. How has traffic and user engagement been trending on that side? Thanks.
<A - Phil Hardin>: This is Phil. So on the Dash Buttons, we're really excited about what we're delivering there. I think
as you saw on the release, there's some new devices that take advantage of the underlying service that we think will be
really convenient for sellers and interesting for device-makers. So we're excited about what we're building there. Don't
have any stats for you today.
On the Twitch side, we continue to let Twitch do what Twitch does best. And so don't have any updates on numbers
there but they continue to really engage customers and offer a really unique experience, which was one of the reasons

<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: And maybe just quickly, end of year fulfillment and sortation centers?
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Yes, I'll take that. So we ended the year at 123 fulfillment centers, up a net 14. And we have
23 sortation centers in the U.S., up four year-over-year.

Our next question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Eugene Charles Munster>: Hey, good afternoon. I want to just quickly revisit the margin pendulum question
and some of your comments, as you mentioned that you expect it to ebb and flow. Could you tell us if you expect it to
ebb and flow but moving higher, or does ebb and flow just mean that it's undetermined in 2016? And then a second
follow-up is the robotics. Any update in terms of number of robots or how you see that expansion going forward?
Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Yes. My comment on ebb and flow was more about the investment and also including
capital expenditures and capital leases, so not around gross margins. And merely I was pointing out that again, we've
laid out all the investment areas where we're seeing heavy investment. We see the continuation of that, certainly, into
2016 and beyond. There are quarter-to-quarter and even year-to-year fluctuations in some accounts in some investment
areas, but generally we're pretty transparent on where we're investing our dollars.
And then against that backdrop, we are always looking for efficiency. And the nice thing about growing the top line at
such a high clip is we have a lot more areas for opportunities to save money year-over-year. And we always look to do
that.
<A - Phil Hardin>: And this is Phil. On the Kiva question, the last update we've given is more than 30,000 robots. We
continue to be really pleased with the program and like what it does in the warehouse, both from a density of storage as
well as from making the jobs easier for the associates, who are picking packages by bringing the packages actually to
the associates, but no new numbers on that.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you, two questions. Was there any category mix impacts in the quarter on gross margins?
That's just a quick one. And then secondly, as you look back at last year, you had some quarters where you really
exceeded your guidance on the CSOI line. Maybe looking back or just looking forward, what are the types of things
that causes you to come in at the high end versus maybe the low end when you look back or when you look forward?
Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sure. First on guidance, we keep a pretty consistent process on how we look at guidance
and how we estimate the near-term view of the business. I will point out that Q4 is obviously a very large quarter, the
largest revenue quarter by far of the year. There's a lot of demand that comes in, in the last six weeks of the year as
well; so, very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do the call, so we're using our best projections on a
lot of fronts. We know it's a consistent process and there are times when we under-run and sometimes when we
over-run it.
<A - Phil Hardin>: This is Phil. On the category mix question, obviously category mix does play a role in gross
margin. I would say, though, that we're much more focused on operating profit dollars and free cash flow dollars. As
we've probably talked about before, the gross margins are impacted by first-party versus third-party mix, as well as
AWS mix if you're looking at the total for the company. So we're much more focused on the dollars. And no specific

categories we're calling out as a driver for gross margin because again, we're much more focused on the profit dollars.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Paul Vogel>: Great, thanks. Just wondering if you could give an update on the strategy around Same-Day
shipping, how we should think about further expansion of that? And what parameters do you guys use to determine
what markets to go in? Is it density of the market? Is it proximity of your distribution facilities? Just some color on that
would be great.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: So, we deliver really quickly a couple of ways. One is the FREE Same-Day that you've seen
us roll out in a number of markets here in the U.S. The other's Prime Now and we're now in more than 25 metropolitan
areas for Prime Now. And delivering for free in two hours is difficult and expensive but customers love it, so we feel
like this is the natural evolution of our delivery and we're happy to invest in that service. We like what it does for Prime
members, we like the convenience factor. And so we're taking a long-term approach and doing what we normally do,
which is really focus on continuing to drive greater and greater efficiency.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your
questions.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Great, thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to ask a little bit more about North
America operating margins, because I think they expanded just under 50 bps this quarter to 4.7%. And that compares to
an average of 200 basis points thereabouts expansion, the prior three quarters. So I'm just wondering if in 4Q, maybe
higher FBA costs or something else in there that led to maybe an expansion not as great as we saw in the prior
quarters? And then following up on the Prime Now question just now, I'm wondering how hour delivery or two-hour
deliveries has changed consumers' perception of just delivery overall? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sure, yes. I'll point out that the demand for FBA services was very high. Nearly 50% of our
third-party units, again, were FBA. And the demand for space and services was very large by our seller base, which
was great from a lot of standpoints and it did exceed our expectations. But it did make our warehouses rather full and
did cause us to incur some additional variable costs in the U.S. And there also is the dynamic that we were fulfilling
more of these units ourselves out of our warehouses because of the FBA growth and the retail growth.
<A - Phil Hardin>: On the speed of delivery, this is Phil; all I can say is that customers love the service. It's very
convenient and it gives them flexibility and ability to get products really quickly. I don't know if there's any big trends
we're ready to call out at this point, but they seem to really, really like it. So we're encouraged by that, we're excited to
invest in it and excited what we can do for our Prime members.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Neil A. Doshi>: Great, two questions, please. One, it seems like the Echo did perform well. Can you talk more
broadly about your Internet of Things ambitions and kind of how Echo plays into that strategy? And then secondly, just
wanted to know a little bit more about restaurant delivery. It seems a little bit outside of the wheelhouse. What's the
impetus on doing more in terms of food delivery, and what are your ambitions there? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: So on the Echo, we like how Echo's done. We're really excited about the ecosystem and
some of the new skills that are being added to Echo as well as some of the other devices that are taking advantage of

Alexa, which is kind of the brains behind Echo. So we like our device business in general. As you probably saw from
the press release, we had a good Q4 where we did almost double the what we did last year. So very excited about the
devices, we like that they pump more energy into Prime and really the whole ecosystem.
Not sure on the Internet of Things, but it's very exciting for devices' standpoint. And the brains of Echo are in the AWS
cloud, and so Echo gets new capabilities all the time as Alexa gets better and better.
On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. This is tied in with the
Prime Now offering in a handful of cities at this point. And so we have the delivery people going out and making the
deliveries in the neighborhoods, and so this is one more really valuable convenience service we can offer for our Prime
customers.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question will come from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your
questions.
<Q - John Blackledge>: Great, thanks. Two questions; first one, shipping costs were higher than we expected. I think
it was 12.5% of net revenue versus 11% last year. Just any color on the higher shipping costs, and is that percentage of
net revenue a new normal as we are in 2016 now and as we look out? And then the second question on Prime Now in
25 markets globally, how should we think about the total number of markets, additional markets you can enter with the
Prime Now offering in 2016? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Olsavsky>: Sure. Yes, as you say, the net shipping margin was up 70 basis points year-over-year.
Again, this is all tied in with the increase in FBA growth and the demand from Prime members. We're shipping more of
our units, so this ripples through our ship cost per unit. And again, the calculation of ship cost as margin is a percent of
revenue, and that is impacted by the denominator effect on the FBA sales being booked at a net revenue.
<A - Phil Hardin>: Related to your Prime Now question, this is Phil, we're in more than 25 metropolitan locations. If
you've been watching, this rollout's really happened in the last year. So it's been a pretty rapid rollout and we're excited
to bring it to more places. We don't have a target for you today, but we're working hard to bring it to more and more
places. We're outside the U.S. now in a handful of countries, in the U.K. and Japan and Italy and working to expand. So
it's a program we're really excited about and we're happy to bring it to more customers.
