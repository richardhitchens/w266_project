questions.
During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements. I direct you to slide 2 for our
disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.
Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a
number of risks and assumptions. We urge to you review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you
review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided in our earnings release and on the website.
For today's agenda, Ellen will start with opening comments; then Nick will review the second quarter financial
performance and near-term outlook. Ellen will then provide comments about the two additional steps DuPont
announced today as we transform to a higher-growth, higher-value company. Then we'll have ample time for your
questions.
With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.
Ellen Kullman
Okay, great. Thank you, Carl, and good morning and thank you all for joining us. I'm pleased to begin today by sharing
highlights about how DuPont performed in the second quarter. DuPont reported $1.9 billion in segment operating
earnings or $1.28 per share on revenues of $9.8 billion. The quarter came out largely as we expected three months ago,
except for the added impact that cold, wet weather in the U.S. and Europe had on some of our businesses.
In Agriculture, the second quarter marked the end to the Northern Hemisphere planting season, which spans the first
half of our calendar year, and our Ag businesses posted industry-leading results in seed and crop protection products.
While the weather caused us to incur more cost to service our customers this season and tempered our earnings growth
a bit, our leading products in both of our Ag businesses performed at the top of their industries. We saw continued
rapid adoption by farmers of our newest AcreMax and AQUAmax feed corn products, and we now see sales of
Rynaxypyr insecticide approaching $900 million for the full year. And we are excited about what we see coming later
this year in the Latin America growing season.
The second quarter also marked a turning point for our titanium dioxide business. While we incurred a $330 million or
$0.27 per share year-on-year decline in the second quarter operating profit from peak levels last year, our business is
rebounding in terms of sequential sales volumes and earnings. Our TiO2 sales volumes in the second quarter increased
12% over last year and 18% over the first quarter. And the increase was spread across all regions. We believe the
industry inventory correction that began last year is now mostly over.
Turning now to new products, in the second quarter, our DuPont community of scientists and product engineers
introduced 465 new products or product applications, bringing the year-to-date total to just over 1,000. These new
products and applications form a healthy balance of new and replacement products and continued to represent the
richness and diversity of our scientific capability. Markets benefiting from our innovative new products in the second
quarter include animal nutrition, aerospace and automotive, textile and paper, filaments for cosmetics, and new
products for photovoltaics with improved environmental sustainability. Examples include the first thermoplastic
automotive jounce bumper, made from a modified grade of Hytrel; Nomex XF for lightweight fire-resisting containers
that reduce the risk of onboard fires in air cargo shipments; and Axtra bacterial phytase enzymes for superior technical
performance and economic benefit in animal nutrition.
With regard to business conditions in the markets we serve, we did see, while modest, some signs in the second quarter
of sequential demand improvement in industrial markets. Volumes in our Performance Chemicals, Performance
Materials, Safety & Protection, and Electronics & Communications segments were up 8% sequentially from the first
quarter and up 5% when seasonally adjusted, reflecting some improvement in demand from global automotive markets,
U.S. housing, military, and general industrial markets.

Regionally, our best growth this quarter occurred in developing markets of Europe and Latin America, led by our
Agriculture businesses and in ASEAN across all of our business segments. In North America, our Safety & Protection
and Performance Materials and Agriculture segments benefited from the recovery in U.S. housing, low-cost ethane
feedstocks, and a strong ag environment. In Europe, we continue to see slow growth environment, particularly in the
automotive segment. However, sales in our Agricultural and Industrial Biosciences segments were solid, and volume in
developing Europe was up 10%. Across Asia, we see strong demand for our Agriculture products. In developing Asia,
while sales were down 5% in the second quarter, volumes were up 2% and included the steep decline in photovoltaic
volume versus the last year. Second quarter sales in China, excluding photovoltaics, increased 4% due to the strong
growth in packaging and automotive demand, coupled with improving demand for titanium dioxide. While
macroeconomic uncertainty continues and demand levels are far from robust, we continue to expect gradual, sequential
improvement in the rate of growth in industrial production for markets that demand our products.
Nick will now explain in more detail our second quarter financial performance and our outlook for the rest of the year.
Nick?
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on slide 3. In line with the
updated guidance we provided last month, operating earnings of $1.28 per share were down $0.22 versus $1.50 in the
prior year. The decline primarily reflects lower Performance Chemicals operating earnings of about $0.27 per share,
largely due to the decline in global TiO2 prices.
Consolidated net sales of $9.8 billion decreased 1% versus the prior year. Volume increased 1%, led by Performance
Chemicals and Safety & Protection segments, which had volume growth of 6% and 5%, respectively. On a sequential
basis, excluding Agriculture and adjusting for seasonality, volumes were up 5%, with increases in all regions of the
world. We expect this momentum to continue as we head into the second half of the year, particularly in PV,
automotive, and construction markets.
Local selling prices declined 1%, primarily due to declining TiO2 prices, which were partially offset by value-driven
pricing in our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments. Currency also had a negative 1% impact on our top line, as
the dollar strengthened against most currencies, particularly the Japanese yen.
Let's turn to slide 4 for more information regarding the company's sales by geographic region. U.S. and Canada local
selling prices increased 2%, primarily due to value-driven pricing in our agricultural segment. The 1% volume decrease
in the region was primarily due to the effect that the cool, wet weather had on our Ag sales. However, for the first half
of the year, local selling prices were up 3%, and volume grew 1% in U.S. and Canada, where demand for our Ag
products drove this growth. In fact, our Ag sales grew 11% in this region in the first half.
In Asia Pacific, higher volume in our TiO2 and Ag businesses was offset by lower volume in our Electronics &
Communications businesses. The 6% decline in local selling prices we experienced in the region in the second quarter
was primarily due to lower TiO2 prices, as well as pass-through pricing in Electronics & Communications based on
lower metal prices. In Europe, volume growth was primarily due to higher demand for TiO2 and Ag products.
However, lower local selling prices were the result of lower TiO2 prices, which more than offset Ag pricing gains.
This quarter, Latin America was our highest-growth region, up 7% versus last year. There we saw 12% higher volume,
reflecting strong Ag sales, which was partially offset by 4% lower local selling prices, reflecting lower TiO2 pricing.
Now let's take a deeper look into the operating earnings for the second quarter. Slide 5 provides a segment operating
earnings variance analysis. From this chart, you can see clearly the large impact the Performance Chemicals segment
had on our overall earnings compared to last year. You can also see the negative impact that the unseasonably cool, wet
weather had on our Nutrition & Health and Ag segments. Additionally, Nutrition & Health operating earnings were
impacted from higher guar inventory prices, lower enablers product line volume, one-time costs associated with
harmonizing systems and processes, and growth investments in this sector.

As you all know, the quarter largely represents the completion of the Northern Hemisphere planting season, which
spans the first half of our fiscal year. Our Ag segment had another tremendous first half, with operating earnings
growing about $175 million or 8%. These results reflect strong corn seed, insecticide, and fungicide sales in North
America and Latin America. We expect this momentum to continue into the second half. And for the full year, we're
anticipating our Ag segment to achieve double-digit earnings growth.
Our remaining businesses generally were impacted by sluggish demand in industrial markets during the second quarter
on a year-over-year basis. However, as expected volumes improved sequentially for many of these businesses in the
second quarter versus the first. On a seasonally adjusted basis, our Electronics & Communications volume sequentially
increased in the second quarter by 10% on higher PV installations in China. Safety & Protection volume sequentially
grew more than 5%, benefiting from higher U.S. demand in ballistics military protection and construction markets.
Additionally, Performance Materials volume sequentially increased on higher demand in automotive and agricultural
markets. We anticipate the demand in these markets to continue to improve as we move into the second half of this
year.
Moving to slide 6. You can see the decline in segment operating earnings resulted in a $0.31 per share negative impact
on our consolidated results. The $0.31 includes a negative $0.03 currency impact for the second quarter. At current
exchange rates, we expect the third quarter currency impact also to be negative by about $0.02 per share, and for the
full year, we are now expecting a negative $0.12 to $0.14 currency impact. This is much higher than our previous
outlook of a negative $0.05, because the dollar has strengthened considerably during the year. As a result, we anticipate
a $0.05 to $0.07 currency headwind in the second half of this year.
The $0.02 benefit from lower corporate expenses that you see on slide 6 reflects this quarter's savings from our 2012
restructuring program. We are on plan to deliver the $300 million in savings that we targeted for 2013. Beyond our
restructuring program, we continue to execute ongoing cost productivity initiatives throughout all of our businesses.
We are well on our way to delivering our commitment of more than $300 million for the full year from these initiatives.
In total, both of these initiatives will contribute significantly to offsetting inflation and helping to fund our growth
investments.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash on slide 7. On a year-to-date basis, the $1.6 billion increase in the seasonal
outflow versus last year was due to lower cash earnings and higher Ag working capital, partially offset by lower
pension contributions. The higher Ag working capital was primarily due to the timing of customer and production
grower compensation payments, which were larger this year due to higher commodity prices. In the second quarter, we
completed the $1 billion share repurchase program using a portion of the Performance Coatings divestiture proceeds.
We're using the remainder of the Performance Coatings proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet, and this is a primary
reason our net debt decreased by $4.2 billion versus this time last year. This gives us the flexibility to execute against
potentially compelling growth opportunities.
Additionally, in April, our board declared a 5% increase to the quarterly dividend, and just last month, we paid our
435th consecutive quarterly dividend. In summary, second quarter results were in line with our expectations, with
lower TiO2 prices being the primary cause for the earnings decrease on a year-over-year basis. These results also
reflect strong Ag sales for the quarter and for the first half. Last, as we expected, volumes were up 5% sequentially on a
seasonally adjusted basis, with increases in all regions of the world, including improving TiO2 volumes.
Let's now look forward to the second half. Today, we reaffirmed our full-year outlook of about $3.85 per share. As
such, we expect operating earnings to be about $1 per share in the second half, or about 60% increase over the prior
year. The second-half outlook includes the additional currency headwind of $0.05 to $0.07. On a seasonally adjusted
basis, we expect the sequential volume growth that we saw in the second quarter to carry into the second half of the
year, particularly in PV, automotive, military protection, construction, and other industrial end use markets.
Additionally, we anticipate volume growth in a year-over-year basis to improve, albeit off an easier comp.
One item that I'd like to highlight for you is that we expect the second-half earnings to be about 40/60 split between the
third and fourth quarters. The reason for the split is largely due to the quarterly split in our Ag segment, as well as the
sequential improvement in demand we expect for our industrial products, which I just discussed. For the second half

overall, we anticipate a smaller seasonal loss in our Ag segment, with low to mid-teens sales growth offsetting the
negative impact of currency and continued strategic growth investments. However, in the third quarter, we anticipate a
substantially larger seasonal loss, as sales growth will be tempered by reduced corn hectares in Brazil's summer season,
higher import costs, and growth investments. On the flip side, we expect earnings to turn positive in the fourth quarter
on strong growth in Brazil's safrinha corn sales, a strong start to the 2014 North American season, and lower import
costs from this year's summer production.
In closing, our current market environment is a dynamic one. All of our businesses are staying close to their customers
to adapt to changing demand signals and continue to serve their needs. Additionally, our businesses are taking actions
to drive productivity in a variety of ways, including reducing expenditures and tightly managing their cash. They are
also shifting resources as new opportunities are identified. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business
plans and our ability to execute against those plans.
With that, let me turn it back over to Ellen.
Ellen Kullman
Great. Thank you, Nick. In summary, our second quarter results were largely as we expected, with strong Ag
performance offset by the cyclical decline in Performance Chemical. Looking forward, with the titanium dioxide
market recovering, and anticipating a gradual improvement in demand from industrial markets, combined with a strong
second half in Agriculture in the Southern Hemisphere, we expect second-half operating earnings to be about 60%
greater than last year.
Turning to slide 8, let me share with you now the next steps in the transformation of DuPont to a higher-growth,
higher-value company: our alignment of senior leadership responsibilities and our exploration of strategic alternatives
for our Performance Chemicals segment. Both steps are fully aligned with our strategic plan to increase the value of
DuPont. You'll remember that we made important portfolio enhancements in the last two years as part of our plan.
These include the $7 billion acquisition of Danisco and our $5 billion sale of Performance Coatings. Also, we
redesigned our cost structure in a way that delivered $2 billion in cumulative savings over the past four years.
On slide 9, a key component of our plan is integrated science. That is, our ability to integrate and deploy our advanced
scientific capabilities in biology, chemistry, and materials in ways that create innovative solutions for customers,
competitive advantage and growth for our company, and value for our shareholders. DuPont has an unmatched set of
strong capabilities in foundational science, but an additional differentiator is our unique ability to work beyond the
boundaries of a single discipline and find novel, innovative solutions at the intersections. Receiving nearly 1,000
patents a year demonstrates my point. While we have capable competitors in individual scientific disciplines, DuPont's
breadth of science is uniquely relevant to where customer demand is heading now in many markets. Simply stated, we
are advantaged like no other company to deliver value to our customers and shareholders.
On slide 10, the question then becomes, where should we prioritize to deploy our integrated science strategy? We've
chosen to leverage our science across three related, attractive spaces. These are ag and nutrition, bio-based industrials,
and advanced materials. Each of these offers us the opportunity to continue to build a high-margin, higher-growth
company. With our global scale, market access, broad customer base, and scientific capability, DuPont is uniquely
positioned to bring a steady flow of innovative new products to these markets ahead of competition. The application
development capability and market access of our advanced materials businesses, along with the value chain
relationships and feedstock knowledge of our Ag and Nutrition & Health businesses offer advantages for DuPont that
no other company has. This is where we pull together the true power of our unique integrated science offering across
all our businesses.
At our Investor Day on May 2, I outlined three strategic priorities we're pursuing at DuPont: first to extend our
leadership in the high-value, science-driven segments of the agricultural-to-food value chains and to leverage the
linkages across these segments. Second, to strengthen and grow our leading position as a provider of differentiated,
high-value advanced materials through science-based solutions. And third, to build out our leading position in

industrial biotechnology, where we can create transformational bio-based businesses in areas like biofuels and
biomaterials. Disciplined execution against these three priorities will transform DuPont to a higher-growth,
higher-value company as we address the world's population-driven challenges of food, fuel, and protection of people
and the environment.
The two steps we announced this morning emanate from these priorities. The realignment of senior management
responsibilities will accelerate deployment of our integrated science strategy across a wide range of materials markets
today. We're elevating Jim Collins, who's currently President of our Industrial Biosciences business, by adding to his
current Industrial Biosciences responsibilities our Performance Polymers business and our Packaging & Industrial
Polymers business. Under Jim's leadership, Industrial Bioscience has already forged important and expanding scientific
and operational synergies with our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health businesses. Now I'm challenging Jim to
accelerate the integration of our leading industrial biopolymers technology across all of our advanced materials
businesses.
This will be a highly visible integrated science at work. For example, in polymers, our renewable polymer portfolio
delivers about $100 million in revenue today, and that number will continue to grow steadily in the future. Of our $4
billion portfolio of engineered polymers, half of that could be renewably sourced in coming years. Integrating
renewable technologies into our existing polymer products and market positions presents a tremendous, competitively
advantaged growth opportunity for us and one that we want to invest in and accelerate. It also exemplifies the potential
of the new DuPont to deliver what our markets are increasingly demanding.
Next, we're pleased to have Matt Trerotola rejoin DuPont as Senior Vice President with responsibility for our
Protection Technologies, Building Innovations, and Sustainable Solutions businesses. Matt will accelerate our growth
plans for some of DuPont's strongest branded products, like Tyvek, Nomex, and Kevlar, and will be accelerating the
introduction of new technologies and looking for ways to leverage our science capabilities across other DuPont
businesses. Matt's priorities will be to accelerate our growth plans and intensify our focus and discipline in a way that
delivers results that meet or exceed the revenue growth and margin targets we shared with you eight weeks ago at
Investor Day.
Let me share with you now insights into our decision to explore strategic alternatives for our Performance Chemicals
segment. This segment includes DuPont Titanium Technologies and DuPont Chemicals & Fluoroproducts. 2012
revenue from this segment was $7.2 billion, and PTOI was $1.8 billion. These businesses have strong market positions,
differentiated products and technologies, attractive global customer bases, and they generate high cash flow. They are,
however, the more cyclical and sometimes volatile businesses in DuPont's portfolio. As I explained at our Investor Day
in May, we've been actively studying this dichotomy for some time now and recently concluded that we should take the
formal step of announcing the process of exploring alternatives. By being transparent in our thinking will enable us to
engage with participants in these industries and value chains and explore options.
Two primary considerations govern our decision to explore strategic alternatives. First, we have limited ability to create
new growth opportunities with these businesses by integrating our science across their markets, customers, and
products. Second, the attractive financial strength and cash-generating capability of these businesses must be
continuously weighed against their higher volatility, cyclicality, and lower growth profile, as is clearly visible this year.
By exploring strategic alternatives, we can determine what options will best drive future growth opportunities for these
businesses and potentially enable our shareholders to realize higher value from these businesses.
Because of the scale of this segment and the amount of internal and external work that must go through in this analysis,
we're at a point where it's best to make our process public. We're evaluating a number of alternatives and may generate
more. We have not reached a decision yet and have work to do, but we will not prolong the process. I want to
emphasize that these are strong, healthy businesses, and our decision on whether or not to proceed will be guided solely
by what presents the greatest value creation now and in the future for our shareholders, consistent with our mission to
increase the value of DuPont.
These announcements are another important step forward in the transformation of DuPont, especially in the context of
our long history in these businesses. But DuPont has always embraced change. As a science company driven by

innovation, we are always looking around the next corner. We have consistently demonstrated that we are committed to
the disciplined execution of our strategy, and we will continue to manage the business actively as we transform DuPont
into a higher-growth, higher-value company for our shareholders.
So, Carl, I'll now turn it back to you.
Carl J. Lukach
Okay. Thanks, Ellen. John, we are ready to go to questions from our callers.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, and I'll begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Don
Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Good morning, Ellen. A question on the decision to spin off TiO2. I'm wondering why not spin
off Ag into a pure play and then leave sort of a DuPont industrial company? And then as a follow-up, I know that you
had about $200 million in stranded costs when you sold Coatings. Are you expecting a similar proportionate amount
with TiO2, and what does that suggest about opportunities for further productivity improvement?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, so, Don, good to hear from you. So, first of all, there's no decision that's been made yet
on the portfolio changes. We're considering strategic alternatives on Performance Chemicals because of the reasons
that I stated in my talk earlier. It has to do with the cyclicality, the volatility, and low growth. And we've gotten to a
place where we've determined that the science really can't help make a difference and truly differentiate those
businesses, except for things like cost and productivity and areas like that. So we need to make sure what the right
future of that business is. Is it inside the company and really drive that set of businesses? Or is there another option that
creates greater value for our shareholders?
And when you think about your provocation about an Ag pure play, it gets back to the integrated science. As we've
developed biotechnology and you look at how it's transformed industries, if you look at how it's transformed Ag. It's
transforming animal nutrition and human nutrition. It's transforming the materials businesses. And the power of the
science is fundamental. It crosses all those boundaries. We have phenomenal value chain capability that we can utilize
to advance that science and be very successful down those routes, whether it's an automotive polymer, whether it's an
advanced material in many different areas. And so I think the power that we can generate from driving that science
across those value chains creates a much stronger return for our shareholders.
Operator
Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi, good morning. I was wondering about the tax basis of the Performance Chemicals
segment. In rough terms, if you were to sell it and to get a reasonable price, would there be a meaningful amount of
taxes you would pay or not?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Jeff, let me take that one. This is Nick. Like Ellen said, I mean, we're very early in the
process, but I can assure you that things such as that, that you're talking about, the tax implications, the debt, all the
different variables that would come into play, we would be taking those, and are taking those into account, in any
decision that we would come forward with.

<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay. And then finally, can you remind me what the maintenance capital expenditures of
the company as it's currently configured are, and how much you spent for growth CapEx, of your roughly $1.8 billion?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, we don't actually break that out into the pieces and the components of how
much is the growth and how much is the run and maintain. We continue to invest in the maintenance of all of our plants
and facilities to make sure we run to the standards within the DuPont Company.

Our next question is from Robert Koort from [ph] Golden X (34:13). Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could help me a little bit on the Nutrition &
Health segment. I think this would be part of that integrated science and should be a higher-value, more stable business.
But obviously this last quarter was a pretty massive reduction in earnings. Is that really a one-off issue, or how should
we think about the stability of that business going forward?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, no, thanks for the question. So if you look at the segment in the quarter, the primary
reason for the earnings being down – half of it is the year-over-year increase in guar, which is a raw material, and it
impacted in second quarter greatly, and it's flattening out for the rest of this year. So it's not going to have that large an
impact over the remainder of the year.
The remainder is really split into three areas. First, there's been some market anomalies in the enablers area. If you
think about the cold start to the season, not many people were buying frozen desserts, and so from a volume standpoint,
our enablers business didn't see what we thought it should see. Second, as we've harmonized our systems and our
processes between Danisco and DuPont coming through the last stages of integration, there's been costs there. And a
number of those hit in the second quarter.
And third, we just opened a probiotic plant in China. We're making growth investments there to catch up on the
investment and to really take advantage of the opportunities that we see there. And so it is a bad quarter for the
business. We can tell you exactly where it is. I'm very confident in the future there, in the science that I see, in the new
products that I see coming down the pike. And so I think that this is just a part of the process to continue to create the
business in the future.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Got it. And my follow-up is a comment for Carl. I think maybe this concept of having the
segment commentary out separately, we can all read that ahead of time is definitely a positive, so I'd encourage you to
do it on an ongoing basis. Thanks.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: I think Nick will miss – or Carl will miss – talking in the meeting, though, so we'll have to talk
about that.
<A - Carl J. Lukach>: Thanks for that, Bob.

Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you and good morning, everyone. If I could just ask on Pioneer in particular,
obviously this year was impacted by higher seed production costs, whether it was winter production or airfreight or
things like that, or higher commodity prices. As we look into next year and if we sort of assume the futures curve is
what it is, and you get some cost relief on the raw materials side, how much of a tailwind do you think you have in
2014 over 2013 in the Ag segment, just from lower costs? Maybe we could talk in basis points or margin or whatever
would be relevant.

<A - Ellen Kullman>: Well, let's start with where we are today, which is in 2013, and I feel really good about the
season and our 11% sales growth. I think the North American season wasn't quite as strong as we had thought coming
into it because of the wet weather at the end, and we had a lot of costs come in from change-outs in our area of – oh,
the maturities. We had to go to shorter maturities as it got colder, and some moved to soy and things like that, so – but
clearly grew corn seed volume in North America in the 2013 season. Now, we're coming into safrinha, a summer
season and safrinha season. We see more of the summer movement to soy, so that means a really strong fourth quarter
impact from the Brazil safrinha season. We see input costs coming down. And we do think that that's positive for the
2014 season, but it's always hard to predict the 2013 season, exactly what's going to come out, much less the 2014. We
need to see where the harvest results come in and the adoption rates on the new technology and new genetics I'm very
excited about, but everything we see going into 2014 is another strong year.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: But you have no sort of idea of what it cost you in 2013? In terms of the higher production
costs?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah. I think you can see from where the margins have gone in that segment over the last two
quarters versus last year, I think you can see the impact of it, maybe 1 point of margin.
Operator
Okay. Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Ellen, just on Performance Chemicals, if you were to sell or spin that business,
can you discuss your ability to maintain the current dividend at current levels?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, I think as we look at our strategic alternatives, we're going to look at this very
holistically. And depending on what the alternative is, it will have different impacts to different aspects of our
company, whether it's debt, dividends, or cash, or pension, share count, taxes – there's a lot of things we have to take
into account. So until we know and have come to conclusion on the what, then we can get into the discussion on all
that.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And just as a follow-up, Ellen. Just – I know on Kevlar, you've had some issues with the
new capacity being filled up. Discuss the efforts under way to – or progress made, at least in Q2, in getting some
additional volumes into the new facility?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, this is Nick. I wouldn't say we've had issues. We continue to look at loading up
the facility. Housing is up 28%. Certainly that impacts Tyvek increases. Military is up in the second quarter. We
continue to drive productivity in that business. Our volume is actually up sequentially 6% quarter over quarter in that.
Margins are up sequentially. If you look at the margins from the fourth quarter through the second, you'll see continued
progression in the margins. So we're continuing to make great progress in that area, continuing to look at finding outlets
for all the material within the whole circuit.

Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning. I guess two questions about just sort of what's changed over the last, call
it five or six months. I guess, first of all, in terms of the currency headwind, what has changed on the positive side to
offset the incremental $0.06 or $0.07 headwind that you now expect? And secondly, you previously expected
Performance Chemicals to come in well above the overall company average PTOI margins across the cycle. You just
mentioned it might have an impact on the dividend philosophy. Can you clarify sort of how you're thinking about the
margin dilution and the impact on – what you see as balancing that off?

<A - Ellen Kullman>: So let me clarify one thing around the dividend. The question was, if we were to do some sort
of transaction with the Performance Chemicals segment, what would the impact on the dividend, and the answer is,
depends on what the transaction is. We've been very clear about our dividend policy as a company and continue to
maintain that.
Performance Chemicals is going through a cycle, and their margins are approaching a cyclical low. What we've said –
over the cycle, it will average about 18% to 20% over the cycle. And so right now you're at a, about a, I think, a 15%
margin, just about that, for this quarter. So you can see where that is. And you saw a couple years ago where their
margin was. So that margin does go up and down on average. It's, as we said, a strong business for the company. But
it's cyclical, it's volatile, and it's low growth.

Our next question is from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yes, John, how are you?
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you. You're moving Performance Materials closer to the integrated strategy by putting
it under Jim, but it's a little harder for me to see how the integrated science in Safety & Protection or Electronics &
Communication would work. They seem more like standalone science businesses relative to the rest of the core. So I'm
curious whether you see any ways to move those businesses over time closer to the core here, or they really will kind of
form something separate?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, no, I think that there is potential there. I think it's – where we've seen it very clearly is in
the polymers area, and as it continues. What we're seeing with enzymes is really quite fascinating, in terms of its ability
to really convert sugars into higher-value order things like monomers, which play equally well into areas in Safety &
Protection as well as Electronics. So it's more expansive than Performance Materials, but I do think Performance
Materials is where you're going to see it first. But there absolutely is tremendous opportunity there from utilizing this
technology, and both Electronics and Safety & Protection have tremendous ability to incorporate differentiated science
to advance them.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Mike Ritzenthaler>: Good morning. On the TiO2 strategic options, Ellen, you've talked many times in the past,
and again, today about the positive impact of matching the [ph] PCAM (44:13) cash flows with the innovation engine.
Can you help us understand why the pace of innovation would not slow in a portfolio that did not have TiO2 as part of
the mix?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Why the pace of innovation – ?
<Q - Mike Ritzenthaler>: Would not slow, if you couldn't match up those – the cash flows, the positive impact of the
cash flows from TiO2 to the rest of the businesses?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: So it's an interesting provocation, and it's one, as we look at the strategic alternatives, we take a
look at how innovation and science has really contributed to these businesses. If you take a look at our flooring
enterprise, our industrial chemicals, and TiO2. And in TiO2, it's really been around manufacturing process technology.
So it's enabled that business, even under tremendous competitive dynamics that occur in that industry, to remain its
return, right, from the investment that we bring to it. So we do generate cash from that. So we have to understand, is

that something you can ring-fence and really operate these businesses to their markets differentially to the rest of the
company, or is there another option that really creates greater value for our shareholders? So I think that's part of the
whole process we're going under.
But I think we have realized, as we've been studying this for the last, I don't know, five or six months and working with
our board on it, I mean, there's not a lot science can do to get the growth rates in those business up above a GDP kind
of rate, and there's nothing science, that we can see, do to arrest the volatility or the cyclicality of those businesses. So I
think those are impacts we have to really consider on the company, and how it's best to play that out in the future.
<Q - Mike Ritzenthaler>: Thank you; that makes sense. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned 3 points of share
gain in summer in safrinha corn in Brazil as you guys kind of own that short relative maturity market. Can you help us
understand what the share change, if there was any, for soybeans in Brazil?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, I think it's a little early to really declare on soy, at least from the North American season.
But in Latin America, I think that we've got small share there. I don't know, it's about 10%. And we continue to make
progress, but it's off a much smaller base than our corn share.
Operator
Our next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.
<Q - John McNulty>: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. When we look through the three strategic
priorities that you had highlighted, it's pretty obvious why the Performance Chemical platform doesn't fit in there, but
when I look at your Performance Materials segment, you've got R&D 1% to 1.5% of sales; there's a reasonable amount
of volatility around it. I guess I'm curious as to why this one necessarily fits in, or is this maybe phase two of some sort
of process in reviewing the businesses?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: No, actually, we've given this a lot of thought as we look at our portfolio. I mean, when you
really think about our strategic priorities of extending leadership in Ag and the food value chain and strengthening and
growing Advanced Materials and Industrial Biosciences – and we have a leadership position from a science standpoint
there – what we've seen very clearly is the application of biotechnology into the monomer area, which then drives a lot
of different sciences, and polymers is a natural extension. We've seen it in Sorona. Our Sorona business was the first
product material. I mean, it didn't exist before – that material didn't. And we've really seen the power of advancing and
using enzymes and microbial pathway engineering to create very differentiated science that's enabled new growth for
us.
And we just see that in the polymers area, our access to those value chains, the things like automotive and things in the
industrial area, I mean, we're finding there's a tremendous interest in renewable in that segment. I mean, so if our
polymers – [ph] engineered (48:06) polymers business is about $4 billion today. What we really see is over half of that
can convert over to renewable in the coming years. If – there's just tremendous interest, and so the question is how can
the science really address that? And the conversations we're having through the Innovation Centers with our customers
in China, and in Turkey, in Russia, in Brazil, in India, are just – I mean, it's really come through to me, the power of
that integrated science and how the marrying of those value chains with the breadth of our science can create a great
future for our company.
<Q - John McNulty>: Okay, great. Very clear. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up with regard to the
Performance Chemicals segment, when we think about your pension liability overall, is there any proportional
difference between that liability and the earnings from your Performance Chem segment? How should we think about
kind of how much of your pension might lie with those assets?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, this is Nick. Those, again, are all decisions that have to be contemplated as we
continue down the path of understanding what our options are and which strategic option makes the most sense and
creates the greatest shareholder value. I can assure you that all of these things are being considered, but it's way too
premature to be talking about anything in that level of detail.

Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, hi, good morning.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Hey, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Ellen, in Performance Chemicals, the TiO2 business is at the top of its cycle, as you mentioned.
Can you talk about the timing of sales? And does this announcement indicate maybe that you think the cycle
[indiscernible] (49:49) as you announce price increases? And then -
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, so let's talk about the cycle [indiscernible] (49:55). I'm sorry, was there another part of
the question, P.J.?
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: No, no. Go ahead.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: So the cycle. Sequentially what we talked about at the Investor Day and even in our first quarter
results is playing out just as we see. We have two consecutive quarters of year-over-year and sequential volume
growth. Volumes were up 12% year over year and 18% sequentially. And so – and we're seeing improvement of
operating earnings sequentially, so we see it bottoming. So why? So customer inventories are returning to a more
normalized level. I mean, we've seen published reports, and they indicate that producer inventories are in the 65-day
range and slightly above normal, right, which would be somewhere between 50 and 60 days. So we see that, as we
discussed, as bottoming, and then we'll see sequential improvement. So we think that cycle is playing out as we've
studied it and looked at it as we've discussed in the past.
So on the second part is, look, we haven't made any decisions to specifically do anything with any asset. We decided to
go public with the strategic alternatives that we're in the process of considering, because we have to engage both
externally and internally with our people on the future, and it's hard to do that under a cloak of darkness, or whatever. I
mean, so we really needed – we're at the point in that analysis where the engagement that we're doing and the questions
that are starting to come up externally, we thought that being transparent there would be best, and that we'll keep you
informed as time goes on about where those alternatives are pointing to.
Operator
Our next question is from Chris Nocella from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Chris J. Nocella>: Hi, thank you. Just how should we think about the timing of when the strategic review could
be complete? Should we think that's sometime within 2013?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, we haven't pegged a timing. We're obviously very actively involved in it now and with
our board, and we'll be back to you when we've got the answers.
<Q - Chris J. Nocella>: Okay. And just on the other half of the segment, the fluorochemicals and -polymers side, can
you help us get a better sense of where you stand in the cycle for those products as well, please?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Fluoropolymers, their volumes were pretty good, but their prices are down as some of those end
segments are going through their own cycle. Fluorochemicals, their volumes were down based on the government
opened up a little more R-22 capability, and so that impacted that business. And so I think they are not going through as
significant a cycle as our TiO2 business is, but they have – if you look for the whole segment volumes were about flat,
and that's indicative of the lower growth that emanates from that cycle. But each one, whether it's fluorochemicals,
fluoropolymers, industrial chemicals, or TiO2, they have very specific cycles that they go through.

Next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes, good morning. Question relates to your outlook for Ag. If we look back over the
past four years or so, your fourth quarter profitability has trended within a very narrow range of maybe $92 million to
$117 million loss there. You're forecasting a profit at this juncture. I would've thought with the way the crop is shaping
up in North America, we could have a slightly more balanced seed market and therefore in North America maybe a
somewhat diminished sense of urgency to place orders early in 4Q. Obviously, LatAm's important. I was just
wondering if you could elaborate on what specifically is giving you a lot of confidence you can post a black number
this year.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, so we got strong momentum, both in our seed business and in our crop protection
chemical business. With the increase in soy in the summer season as we're seeing it now, there's going to be a large
increase in hectares in the safrinha Brazil corn sales season, so that's going to be growth for us, with our Intrasect and
our new genetics that we're putting into that marketplace. We think 2014, based on what we think, we think it'll have a
strong start. And, thirdly, it's that lower seed input cost from 2013 seed production as yields have normalized and lower
commodity prices that are going to benefit in the quarter. And, again, things like Rynaxypyr and picoxystrobin and
things like that are looking to have a strong season in the Southern Hemisphere. So it looks like from those types of
changes that we're going to make a little money in the fourth quarter in our Ag segment.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Okay, and then as a follow-up, if I may, your overall price contribution turned slightly
negative. I think it was first drop since the fourth quarter of 2009. Obviously TiO2 would have been a big part of that,
but can you comment on whether or not you're seeing price pressure in other areas of the portfolio, and whether it
would have been positive ex-pigment?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, so Performance Chemicals is the big one. The other one that you might not have noticed
is the metals pricing in our Electronics & Communications – the silver price is down. So our price is down. That's a
direct pass-through to the customer. So it doesn't have much of an earnings – from that standpoint. So those two are
predominantly where prices hit. If you look at Ag, we had strong price progression in Ag based on strong product there,
but those are the two that are really the most impactful.
Operator
Our next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you. I'll just ask one question, Ellen. As you think about adding two more people to
the office of the CEO – more chiefs, same number of Indians – looks like you're moving more to a centralized
decision-making process. Can you talk about how this is going to play out?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, so actually, they're not in the office of the CEO. They're at the next level down from an
execution standpoint. So they're going to each have three businesses to really drive the integrated science and
execution. So I look at this very much as a divide and conquer. We got a lot of opportunity in this company. Tom needs
to focus on return on research and development and operating excellence. Mark is focused on making sure this
Performance Chemicals strategic alternatives comes out in the right place. Jim is focused on Agriculture and Nutrition
& Health. And we've got a lot of opportunity to continue the improvement in Safety & Protection, which Matt's going
to look at, and the integration of the science across that. So I think this is a natural extension of really driving our
strategy, number one, and, number two, upping our game on execution, which I think is a very strong point.

<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey, good morning. You know, if you sell or spin out TiO2, the Q&A portion of your
conference call is going to be rather boring, don't you think?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Well, at least in the last couple of quarters it would be a little shorter. But I guess then we'd put
the color commentary back in for Carl [indiscernible] (57:30).
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: No, no, no, no, please don't! Please don't! I agree with the earlier comment. Hey, just on – just
so I understand the health of the industry right now on TiO2, you talked about double-digit volume growth year over
year and sequentially, and in your Q3 outlook you also mentioned double-digit volume growth. I'm imagining that's
more year over year, but where do you think you're going to fall out sequentially? Where are volumes there? And then
what are your thoughts on pricing for TiO2 in the back half of the year?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, so as you know, TiO2 has a very strong season that is in the second quarter, right? So if
TiO2 is going to have a season, it's going to be in the second quarter, and that's what you've seen. So you've seen a
season, both from a sequential standpoint and from a year-over-year standpoint. If I look at the third quarter, I think the
third quarter year over year is going to be up 10%. And sequentially it's going to be 1%, 2% up sequentially. But we're
seeing it in the places where you would consider there to be real need. So in U.S., where we're seeing a stronger
housing environment, and in China, where we're seeing kind of the same thing. So that is creating what we're
considering that bottoming and the stability. And from a price standpoint, that's a market dynamic; we don't talk price.
We'll see what happens as that goes forward. But I think that, where we see the volumes, I think that's given us – it's
given us the confidence to kind of predict what we're looking at for the second half of the year.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Okay, great. And then on photovoltaics, you had talked in the past about the second-half
recovery. And it looks like you are starting to see some improvement in that business. Can you talk about the pace of
improvement and where the industry stands on the supply side and the de-stock side, et cetera?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, as you look at the PV market, the installs, we're talking about a 10% sort of
increase year over year from an installation standpoint, and then you got to figure how that backs into the materials side
of it. Like I said earlier, when you look at our increases of our material components on a sequential basis in that, we're
seeing things start to pick up, Frank. So we're seeing some of that traction occur, and we believe we'll continue to see
that in quarters three and four.
