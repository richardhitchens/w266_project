Thanks, Amy. Good morning. By now, you've seen the press release with Avon's second quarter results. I'm pleased to
say that we continue to make progress towards the stabilization of Avon's business. This morning, I will speak briefly
about our second quarter performance. Kimberly will then take you through a detailed review of our results and we will
then open the line for Q&A.
As we look at the second quarter, some parts of our business showed continued improvement. In our EMEA region,
many of our markets performed well. We are particularly pleased by the strong performance of Avon Russia. The team
there has done a great job of both improving and integrating the representative experience and the consumer
proposition.
While each of our markets has some unique characteristics, we are looking closely at the progress that the Russia team
has made and we are sharing learning across the organization. In our Latin American region we saw good performance
from some of our major markets including Brazil and Mexico.
While I'm pleased with the progress our Latin American team has made, we do have some concerns about external
headwinds and potential economic slowdowns in some of our markets. Kimberly will address this in further detail.
In both Latin America and EMEA, the teams are working to ensure that growth is sustainable and to drive consistent
performance across all markets within the region. Our North American region was down on all measures and the U.S.
business continues to decline. While it's clear that there's a lot of work ahead of us, we remain committed to turning
around the U.S.
In late June, we appointed a new leader for the North American business, Pablo Muñoz. Pablo joins Avon from
Tupperware where most recently he was Group President of the Americas region. Pablo has extensive experience in
direct selling in both housewares and beauty. He has led multiple turnaround efforts at Tupperware including those in
the company's North American and Latin American markets.
It's been clear from day one that Pablo is genuinely committed to building a strong connection with the field and with
Avon representatives. Avon will be well served by Pablo's deep experience in both consumer products and direct sales.
While he is quickly immersing himself in Avon's business, it will take some time to map out and execute the U.S.
recovery plan. We will update you as we go.
Our Asia-Pacific region also saw a decline in performance. Some of this was anticipated, as we continue to work on
rebuilding our business in China. We have a lot more work ahead to get the business to where it needs to be.
However, we also need to improve performance in our other Asian markets, particularly the Philippines. Longer-term,
there is good potential for future growth in Asia, but right now, our top priority is stabilizing our key markets. It is clear
that we need to have all of our key markets performing well in order to have consistent sustainable growth for Avon.
Turning to category performance, Beauty is a highly competitive market and we need to have consistent performance
across our four product categories. We remain challenged in Skincare. And as I've said before, we have great products
and innovation here and we should be performing better.
Skincare, and particularly, facial skincare is a significant segment in both the U.S. and Asia. We are aggressively
tackling broad Skincare category issues in parallel with strengthening our product portfolio in these markets.
We continue to make progress in Fragrance and Fashion & Home, and in Color, we are watching enhancements to
Avon Color in the second half of this year. As we've discussed in the past, Color is a critical category for bringing new
representatives and consumers to Avon.
It is important that we invest behind our growth drivers. We are taking a thoughtful and disciplined approach to
investing in the brand and in new innovations. We are also putting additional resources behind key new product
launches in the second half of 2013.
I do want to add that overall, our Avon associates are very engaged in helping drive our turnaround. We are working
with discipline and focus and we are beginning to embrace a one team mindset. All this has led to more effective

execution, a cost conscious mindset and a prioritization of efforts to what matters most.
Also of note in the second quarter, we announced the sale of Silpada. This was an important step for us as divesting
Silpada enables us to focus our resources on the core Avon business. Regarding FCPA, as you will see in our 10-Q, we
made a settlement offer in June that was rejected by the government. I hope you can appreciate that we cannot provide
any additional information beyond what is stated in the 10-Q.
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter, but Avon's turnaround will take time and there's still
considerable work to be done to deliver consistent, sustainable performance.
I will now hand it over to Kimberly for her review of the second quarter results. Kimberly?
Kimberly A. Ross
Good morning and thank you, Sheri. In terms of the second quarter, I'm particularly pleased with our margin
performance. However, we still have a lot of work to do to generate sustainable sales growth across all of our regions,
particularly North America and Asia-Pacific. For the quarter, our constant dollar revenue rose 2%. On a reported basis,
revenue was down 2% negatively impacted by currency. We continue to see positive growth in Latin America and
EMEA, partially offset by weakness in North America and Asia-Pacific. Units were unchanged. We continued to
experience weakness in Beauty units in all regions, except EMEA, and remain focused on driving a recovery in this
area.
Price mix was up 2% in the quarter. The increase was driven by Latin America where we took inflationary pricing as
well as some selective strategic price increases in Beauty. Strong Fashion & Home performance was also a factor given
the higher price points. Overall, active representatives were unchanged with increases in EMEA and Latin America
offsetting continued decline in North America and Asia-Pacific. Adjusted gross margin was up 40 basis points to
63.3% largely due to lower air freight costs, particularly in Latin America. Adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis
points to 9.5% in the quarter, which was better than we expected. Key margin drivers versus prior year include the
improved gross margin and lower administrative costs including those associated with FCPA investigations. In
addition, adjusted operating margin benefited from lower advertising expenses and lower brochure costs. Adjusted EPS
was $0.29 per share compared with $0.21 a year ago.
With that said, let me move to the regional discussion. Starting with Latin America, revenue rose 7% in constant dollars
with some benefit from the shift in timing of Easter. The underlying growth was driven by increases in average order,
which partially benefited from inflation in Venezuela and Argentina. Active representatives were also up. Units rose
1% driven by strong increases in Fashion & Home, while Beauty units were down 1%. Price mix in the region was up
6% largely due to the inflationary pricing as well as mix, given the stronger performance of Fashion & Home relative
to Beauty. Selective strategic price increases in Beauty were also a factor.
Brazil constant dollar revenue was up 4%. Growth in Brazil benefited from active representative growth as we entered
the quarter with strong representative count. This was partially offset by lower average order due to underperformance
in skincare. Revenue growth benefited partially from the shift in Easter timing. Constant dollar Beauty sales were
unchanged as skincare remained soft, while Fragrance was up modestly. Some examples of success in the quarter are
the Luiza Brunet fragrance, Naturals gift soaps, and the Amazing Eyes merchandising event.
Fashion & Home sales were up 19% in constant dollars, with continued benefits from the more effective pricing and
improved merchandising we instituted last year. Beginning in quarter three, we will be lapping this benefit as well as
the actions we took to flow excess inventory last year. We continue to expect solid Fashion & Home growth in the
second half, just not at the same rate as in recent quarters. Our Q2 Fashion & Home growth came on the back of a 20%
reduction in our size of line as we are harmonizing products across the region and cutting unproductive SKUs. This is
one example of the successful simplification initiative that will ultimately help reduce inventories and costs.
I am also pleased to report that we are making good progress in improving our service levels in Brazil. With that said,
the competitive environment in Brazil has intensified over the past several months with key competitors increasing

advertising, as well as the depth and frequency of their discounting. They also have plans to significantly accelerate
their new product activity. As we've indicated in the past, there are many aspects to the Brazil turnaround including
rebuilding brand health and ensuring we have locally relevant products that are priced appropriately. Clearly,
continuing to drive the Brazil recovery remains a key priority for our team. To that end, in the second half, we'll be
increasing the pace of new product launches, which will support – with higher levels of field investment and
advertising.
In Mexico, growth was 4% in constant dollars, primarily driven by the timing of the Easter holiday. Underlying growth
was driven by active representatives, which were up due to improved activity and retention. Beauty was strong in
Mexico with the exception of fragrance, where we still have work to do. We mentioned to you in the recent past that
the consumer market conditions are weakening in Mexico and we are witnessing this in recent campaigns that have
softened. So, there is some risk to growth in the second half. Venezuela was up 15% in constant dollars. The growth
was driven by an increase in units and inflationary pricing which benefited average order.
We believe some of the unit growth was due to representatives stocking up on Personal Care products. In addition,
there was some benefit from the Easter timing. Latin America adjusted operating margin was 13.4%, up 360 basis
points due to lower advertising relative to the very high levels of spend in Q2 2012 in support of new product launches.
Gross margin also benefited from lower air freight costs in part due to our cost reduction initiative. We feel good about
the progress in Latin America, but there are some potential headwinds in the second half including uncertain economies
in Mexico and Brazil, increased competition, and a difficult environment in Venezuela and Argentina. So we are
focusing on initiatives to sustain the progress we have made so far. To the end, we will be investing in the second half
against our new product initiatives and efforts to sustain momentum in representative growth and retention.
Moving to EMEA, revenue increased 5% in constant dollars and we are very pleased with the continued progress of
this region. Eastern Europe led by Russia contributed about half of the growth. But the growth extended beyond those
markets and was driven by both active representatives and higher average order.
Russia revenue increased 8% in constant dollars, driven by strong active representative growth. Russia continues to
benefit from their continuity program that rewards representatives for consecutive orders each campaign. In addition,
revenue is benefiting from improved marketing. In part, this improvement was driven by the recent relocation of
brochure development from Warsaw to Moscow. This is a good example of our efforts to drive more locally relevant
innovation and brochures. The Russia results also benefited from the strength of Naturals, as well as good performance
of unit movers across all our Beauty categories.
UK revenue declined 5% in constant dollars. The decline was due to lower active representatives. We have a new
experienced and highly capable team in place in the UK, but it will take time to drive sustainable improvements in this
market. Turkey revenue rose 9% in constant dollars driven by higher average order, which benefited from a change in
the compensation structure for sales leaders aimed at improving productivity.
Additionally, this quarter results benefited from easier year-over-year comparisons. We expect performance in Turkey
to remain volatile, and while we are starting to make some progress, we are not yet seeing sustainable growth.
In South Africa, constant dollar sales rose 11%, primarily due to higher average order. This was partially offset by
lower active representatives, which continued to be impacted by last year's credit policy changes. We expect South
Africa results to remain strong as we lap some of the changes in our credit policies in the second half.
Adjusted operating margin in EMEA was 15.9% up 390 basis points. About half of the benefit was due to one-offs in
last year's base, more specifically due to charges we took last year for bad debt and brochure costs.
Underlying operating margin benefited from revenue leverage and a number of SG&A initiatives around the
organizational structure, head count and brochures. We are encouraged with the progress made to-date in this region
and the team is focused on sustainability going forward.
Turning to North America, this region remains challenging, and reported a 12% revenue decline. Results for North
America no longer include Silpada, which is now being classified within discontinued operations, given the recent sale.

As Sheri indicated, Pablo joined us a month ago and he is already identifying key initiatives to stabilize the business.
We won't be specific today since it is still very early days. Adjusted North American operating loss was $6.2 million
primarily due to revenue deleverage. While the team is making progress in reducing costs in this region, these benefits
are being offset by the negative leverage given the continued double-digit sales decline.
The U.S. remains one of our greatest challenges. It is a large and complex market and it will take time to execute
corrective actions in a thoughtful and cohesive way. Asia-Pacific, revenue declined 10% on a constant dollar basis,
mainly due to continued weakness in China, as well as weakness in active representatives in other markets. Active
representative count declined 11% and units were down 12%.
China constant dollar revenue was down 28%, as we continue to work to rebuild the business. This market remains
difficult and we do not expect it to improve anytime soon. As you know, we are focused on fixing the business and the
value proposition, so we can regain the trust of the BB owners.
Additionally, it is now more clear that many of our Beauty Boutiques are carrying high levels of inventory. As we work
through these issues, we expect the rate of sales decline in China to accelerate in the second half of the year.
Philippines revenue declined 2% on a constant dollar basis as operational challenges in this market contributed to a
decline in active representatives. Adjusted operating margin was 6.3% in Asia Pacific, down 70 basis points. This was
largely due to higher bad debt expense in the Philippines as well as lower gross margin, mainly due to increased
obsolescence in China. Asia-Pacific in total remains challenging, and we expect results to remain soft in the second
half.
Now, I'll take you through four adjustments we had to our GAAP results in the quarter. First, similar to Q1, as a result
of the Venezuela currency devaluation, we recorded a $17 million charge from using the U.S. historic dollar cost basis
of non-monetary assets such as inventory.
Second, related to FCPA, we recorded a $12 million accrual for the settlement offer that we made in June which the
government rejected. While it is probable that any settlement will be at a higher number and could be material, we
concluded that it was appropriate to book our offer amount now. There is more detail about FCPA in our 10-Q.
Third, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $13 million pre-tax for the early repayment of
our 2014 debt maturities. And fourth, we recorded an $8 million pre-tax cost to implement restructuring charge as part
of our $400 million cost savings initiative.
In addition, we recorded a $79 million pre-tax charge for Silpada, though this shows up in discontinued operation.
Consistent with our strategy as a result of this divestiture, we are better able to focus our efforts and investments on our
core business.
Moving on to cash flow, I am pleased to report that we continue to make progress in this area. Net cash provided by
operating activities was $70 million for the six months ending June 2013, compared with $37 million in the same
period in 2012. The improvement was due to improved operating profit offset by make-whole premiums and lower
income tax payments. This was partially offset by higher payments for employee incentive compensation and
restructuring and a contribution to the UK pension plan in 2013.
We also made good progress on working capital, which operationally improved 10 days, inventory improved four days
operationally, driven by good inventory management with EMEA being the highlight. Accounts payable improved six
days operationally due to a timing difference.
Looking forward to the second half of the year, we continue to expect modest sales growth driven by EMEA and Latin
America. However, North America and Asia-Pacific will remain soft as we work to address their challenges. As a
reminder, in the first half we had several one-offs as well as some timing benefits from the adverse items in first half of
2012. We also had high-levels of advertising in LatAm last year. Combined, these items were about half of the 380
basis points of margin expansion in the first half.

As we look to the second half operating margin, you should keep the following additional items in mind. We are
increasing the field investment in Brazil in support of new product launches. IT spending will accelerate due to
infrastructure improvements in digital tools to support our representatives.
We will see higher transportation costs, primarily due to inflation in Latin America and we expect foreign exchange
impact to be more negative in the second half given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar and we have a difficult
comparison against last year's benefit from accruing lower employee incentive compensation.
Given all of those items and given our expectation on modest sales growth, we expect the second half of 2013 adjusted
operating margin to be comparable to the second half of 2012. Also, keep in mind that the third quarter is a smaller
revenue quarter relative to the fourth, so spending has a bigger impact on margin.
In closing, in my experience, turnarounds of this magnitude take time and uneven performance during the journey is
not unusual. It is a balancing act between making tough decisions to stabilize the company, while at the same time,
prioritizing investments to ensure a healthy future.
We are making the tough decisions and we are taking a rigorous approach to prioritizing our investments to drive
sustainable growth. This is all key to the long-term health of the business and I am confident we are on the right path.
With that, I'll hand it back to Sheri for some closing comments, and then we'll take your questions.
Sheri McCoy
Thanks, Kimberly. As you've heard from Kimberly, parts of the business are responding well to our stabilization
efforts, while we continue to struggle in other areas. When I look at the markets that have shown significant
performance improvement, a few key things emerge.
First, there is a focus on the fundamental drivers of our business. The teams in these markets put the representative and
consumer at the heart of the business and take a truly integrated approach. They have strong representative recruitment
and retention. They are improving service and have great products that meet local consumer needs. They are balancing
investment in the representative and the brand. And these markets have strong leadership with a focus on
accountability.
Second, there is a discipline in identifying and resourcing the activities that matter most. And finally, there is an
emphasis on balanced growth with attention to both the top and bottom line and cash generation.
We are working with a sense of urgency to address the issues in the individual markets that are not performing well. At
the same time, we must make all decisions with a view of the long-term.
In closing, while I'm pleased with our progress to date, I'm not satisfied. We need to continue to improve our overall
performance and to do that we will remain focused on better serving Avon Representatives, creating a compelling
consumer proposition and simplifying our business.
Looking back at the past three quarters, it's clear that Avon is headed in the right direction. But please remember, that
there is a long road ahead of us. We anticipate some variability in our financial performance as we work through the
turnaround and make the decisions necessary to position us well for the long-term.
We will now open the line for questions.

<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, I'm from Citigroup. My question has to do with the U.S. business, and if I can kind of
look at some of your other key markets, it seems like your focus has been on sort of stemming or stabilizing the
margins and focusing on cash flow and cost savings first and focusing on reaccelerating top line growth kind of second.
I know you don't want to talk specifically about initiatives in the U.S., but can you talk about kind of order of
magnitude where your priorities lie, is it on reinvesting and reaccelerating top line growth or first, are we going to put a
bandaid and stem the bleeding in terms of the profitability? Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Thanks, Wendy. Well, certainly the U.S. business is a very important business for us and we've
been working for probably 18 months now trying to stabilize it. And I think it's clear that we're not getting the results
that we desired. And it's a combination – we can't just look at cutting without looking at how we strengthened the top
line. And if I look at some of the diagnostics and this is an area where Pablo is very focused. Part of the challenge is we
need to make sure that we have a healthy field and that we are bringing new people into Avon from a representative
standpoint, that they are engaged and that we have the right consumer proposition. That requires us to make sure we
have the right price points and that we can invest in the business. So, we are tackling it from the standpoint of making
sure we're understanding the field piece, which helps us drive sales. At the same time, I think it's fair to say that we
continue to look at how do we if we are going to be a lower base, how do we manage it from a cost perspective? So, we
are looking at both the top line and bottom line, but they are very well linked and we can't do one without focusing on
the other. Kimberly, I don't know if you want to add any other commentary on that.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: No. Just one thing I will say is that in the U.S. they have been focusing on cost as well as
trying to drive the top line, but as Sheri said, some of the things we've been doing obviously have not ended in the
results that we want. But with regards to cost, in absolute dollars they've continued to take cost out, but obviously with
the sales declining, we've lost some of the leverage there on the cost base.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Thanks, Wendy.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: And just in terms of as we look forward, I know the fourth quarter, in particular, tends to
be big as the reps are keen to make more money in the holiday season. Is the fourth quarter, are you at the point where
you can say the fourth quarter is sort of full of reinvestment activity and we can sort of look towards whether it's
advertising spending or promotion or new products or whatever or is this really just going to be a longer-term
timeframe than that?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah, I think as we look at, we're going to take it as we go. It is clear that certainly the holiday
season, we do have a – we are focusing from the standpoint of gifting et cetera and so there's opportunity there, but
certainly, I would not put money behind advertising until we have the field in a better place. We have to get that
balance right. We are clearly looking at that to make sure we're getting the right consumer proposition in sync with the
representative promotion piece.
We look at some of our other markets that have done it well. What we see is that they've really been able to balance.
They're introducing new products and putting money behind advertising. They've also taken that through the field and
had a very healthy field approach. And so we have to make sure we have all cylinders operating before we plough more
money in from an investment standpoint.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Got it. Thanks.

and a lot of the work you're doing to stabilize things has to be at the market level. But I think you guys in some of your

presentations and meetings have started to address the question of your strategy in Skincare of needing to take a sort of
different approach of maybe rethinking some things about launch pacing and activity. So, I think of that as sort of a
parallel process to the in the field operational improvements and at some point, those two match up and start to work in
tandem. So, if you could update us a little bit on perspective on Skincare, innovation portfolio, and merchandising and
thoughts about that over the next 12 to 24 months? Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. Skincare is an area that we have great science and great technology and certainly is a very
attractive market. As we looked at Skincare, and it varies a little bit to your point, Lauren, about where we are in
different parts of the world, but I think in aggregate, we have not done a particularly good job of helping our
representatives or our consumers sell Skincare in a meaningful way. So, as we were introducing a number of new
innovations in Skincare, it was hard for people to know how the campaign one was different than the campaign 20, the
year before. So, we were not clear about how the brand architecture works. And so, we had things overlapping, and so,
while we're introducing innovation, it was not incremental.
So, the team has come back and we have new leaders in Skincare, running Skincare and put together a brand
architecture that's pretty clear around how do we position against the critical consumer benefits, what's the role of each
of the elements of our line against those benefits and we're in the process of working through that. So, the team is very
engaged from that standpoint in terms of getting the architecture right, and then importantly, the pacing, and then, the
investment behind that.
One of the other challenges we have is because our U.S. business and our Asia business, and particularly China, are
weak, those are really strong Skincare businesses for us. So if you look at units there, because we don't have the
representative piece or the Beauty Boutiques in the right place, we're also getting a double whammy. So, we have that
challenge and coupled with the fact that we need to look at it more broadly from a category performance. So, I expect
that we, when we clean up the category piece of it, we will be able to make more traction in some of the other markets
faster than ones that we have more challenged like the U.S., or China, as it relates to Skincare, specifically.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi. It's Deutsche Bank. Good morning.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey. Can you just talk about some of the trends specifically in Latin America into June,
because Natura had some fairly cautious commentary about what's happening in Brazil in June. And then, maybe how
long it takes for you guys to push pricing through because I know there's sort of like a four month to six month lag time
on sort of developing and printing a catalogue and then getting it out for the campaign? And then just a housekeeping
item, if I kind of look at margin structure, I know you said that the back half of this is year is going to be the same, as it
was last year, but if you look at that sequentially, I think it was only a 5.9% operating margin in the third quarter of last
year. So, maybe, what's driving close to like a 350 basis point decline in that operating margin number?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Okay. I'll start with the – just a commentary on Latin America. Certainly what we see is a very,
very competitive market, certainly you've seen on Natura's announcement and we see [ph] Ardivacario (33:17)
investing heavily as well as the traditional CPG companies. We see this, still as a very attractive Beauty market and a
lot of opportunity for us to do well particularly as we look at our price points and how we compete. So, we are going to
continue to look at how we invest behind new products and make a difference in that space. I think one of the areas in
pricing, first of all, it's an area that we don't have as much capability as we would like in that area and we have taken
some price, but we really need to get better at understanding how we use price from a strategic standpoint. So,

particularly, as we look at some of our category strategies, I'll use Fragrance as an example, we've made improvements
in the base. We've been able to take price in some of our base products, but we really need to figure out how do we
move the consumer up the chain and get the pricing appropriate.
So, we will continue to look at that. I do think it's both Brazil and Mexico are areas that we're going to stay very close
to in terms of looking at the economic environment, as well as the competitive standpoint. The good news is Beauty
still is an attractive category. We just have to make sure we understand how we can get more of our fair share.
Kimberly, I don't know if you want to comment on the margin.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, I'll talk a little bit about the margin. Just reiterating what I said about the first half of
2013, we had several one-offs in there. We had some timing benefits from advertising, where we had high-levels of
advertising in the first half of last year. And also those items were about half of the 380 basis point margin
improvement that we saw in the first half. If we then look at the second half, using what we put forth as modest sales
growth, some of the drivers in the second half are the field investment that we expect to have in Brazil that we're
putting behind some new launches, IT spend on infrastructure as well as tools for the representative, which is very
much in line with what we had said before that we would be spending some additional funds there. We do expect to
have some higher transportation costs in LatAm. This is primarily driven by inflation coming through and also we'll
have some foreign exchange being – impacting us being that the U.S. dollar has been strengthening. That's assuming
that foreign exchange rates are doing what they're doing today. And also keep in mind that last year, we had some
benefit from the bonus incentive reversals that took place. So, looking all in all, those are some of the drivers, I know
there's a lot of one-off stuff back and forth, but that's – and the quarter three is also a smaller quarter.
Also, I think it's important to keep in mind and I pointed this out with Wendy's question is that while we are continuing
to focus on getting costs down, we do have deleveraging that's impacting us from the U.S. as well as from Asia. So,
that continues to be a challenge with us as we work to fix those businesses.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Great. And hey, could you just comment on how long it takes you to price given the length of
time that it may take to print the catalogues?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: It – yeah, we have different ways of approaching that, Bill. So, yes there is a time because
obviously we print the catalogues well ahead of time, but also what we can do is with flyers, we can adjust some
pricing also in some markets. When it was necessary, we were able to do stickers to be able to adjust pricing as well as
where we do have some online stuff taking place. Obviously, that's a bit more flexible for us.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Good morning. It's Bank of America. A question on North America, with the hiring of Pablo, now
do you think you have the right people in place or is there still a need for additional personnel, and obviously, he's only
been on the job for a month now, but has he had a chance to make any initial assessment yet on the business and has he
expressed any opinion on how to restore the U.S. business, whether redistricting is the right thing to do and what else
needs to be done?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Well, certainly he has only been here a month, and so I want to be fair to him. He certainly has
spent a lot of time with his team and has already been out in the field a couple of times and will be spending the next
couple of weeks out in the field, meeting with representatives to really make sure he understands the situation. He
certainly sees that some of the things that we have in place aren't working to the extent that we'd like them to work. So,
he's going to really take a fresh look and fresh perspective at all of the things that need to be done, and he's going to
make sure he has the team all marching in the right direction against that plan. So, Olivia, I wish I could say more, but
it's a little early for us at this point and we'll come back as we get additional information. Thank you.

<Q - Olivia Tong>: Got it. And then just a follow-up, you mentioned a couple of investments that you're planning to
do in the second half behind the rep, ordering online, things like that. What percent of your markets after you're done
doing your investments can – in what percent of the markets can the reps order online once you've finished doing your
investments?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. Most of them today can order online. It varies a little bit depending on where you are in the
world. So, some of our markets in Eastern Europe, for example, have 100% representative ordering online, other
markets, it's less. What we're doing, as we're investing is looking at how to really evolve it to the point where the
representative can also have her consumer come on directly to her and be able to order online. So, it's a multi-staged
approach and as we look at our IT plan, it's going to take a number of years, because one of the challenges we see and
it's probably consistent with many decentralized companies is we have some of the newer markets, and I'll use Eastern
Europe as an example, where their technology is newer, about 20 years or 30 years newer than some of our more
legacy markets like the U.S. or Canada or Brazil, for that matter. So it's easier to make some of the upgrades and
innovations that we want to do to some of those markets, it's going to take us a little bit longer, and we have to do it in
stages in some of the other areas. So it's really a longer-term plan to get the business to where we think it needs to be.
And so that's why as we built the plan for the turnaround is really to say we are going to invest over next the three years
from a CapEx standpoint for IT, but also – we also need the resources in the businesses to be able to execute a lot of
these things and we need to stage that appropriately. So, if I were to say today probably our Eastern European, Central
European businesses are more sophisticated than some of our other businesses and we're trying to move all the
businesses to a better place. Thanks, Olivia.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yes, Thanks. It's Stifel. I wanted to understand the operating margin commentary for the
second half. I'm still not quite sure I understand it. Maybe give us a bit of order of magnitude for what is reinvestment
and other sort of less recurring items like FX, transportation. Is there an expectation that gross margin will increase? I
think if you look at like the smart value offerings from a year ago, in particular, in Europe, it seems to be a pretty big
impact relative to sort of where you've been in the first half of the year. So just sort of curious the puts and takes on that
operating margin output, especially given, as somebody said previously, that you're seeing a pretty precipitous
deceleration from 2Q to 3Q, at least in terms of what you're saying.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. So, I'm not going to go in to the detail of breaking it down by basis points for each of these
areas. Obviously, we have a lot of moving parts that are taking place here. Definitely, your comment is valid with
regards to gross margin, especially since we were flowing inventories last year in Latin America, which impacted our
gross margin. So, obviously we're focusing on continuing to improve the gross margin. But, yeah, with that said, we
have some initiatives coming through that, to try to reduce costs, but we also have the increased spend that we will
have. If you look at timing, for example, investment in new launches, so we have launches coming in the second half of
the year, that we're going to support with the additional marketing. I think if you look at last year, especially in the first
half, we spent some money on new launches, and we're not certain that we got necessarily the returns that we would
have liked to have gotten. So, this year, we've really been taking a rigorous approach to where do we want to invest and
behind what launches, and we think it's the right thing to do to invest behind some of these items, not only for the short
term, but also it's good for the longer term of the company.
And as we've said before, with regards to systems that we will be spending money there, it is for some infrastructure
systems as well as for representative tools, that are important for us to have a good and more modern value proposition
for our representatives to help them do business.
So, and again, we've got foreign exchange coming through there as well as some of the one-offs last year. So, yeah, I
appreciate that you'd like me to break it down in basis points, or give you a bit more detail on that. But there are a lot of
moving parts here, and what we're trying to give is really some of the highlights of what we're currently expecting for

the second half of the year.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Maybe just to put it in a different context then, gross margin versus SG&A, so, gross
margin wise, is it going to be in line with where you've been in the first half of the year or is that going to be the piece
that's impacted or is it really on the SG&A side?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. I'm not going to go into breaking down the details of that. So, we are continuing, as I said,
we're lapping against last year, where gross margin was impacted by all the flows and we do continue to have
initiatives in place with regards to improving gross margin. But, I'm not going to get into breaking it down for you,
although I appreciate it very much that you would like to have more detail on that.

The next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, I'm from Bernstein. So, it's certainly like – one takeaway that it sounds like you're increasing
spend relatively significantly in the second half of this year, which to be fair, is probably the right thing to do for the
long term, but this is – it feels like different than what you said at least at the CAGNY conference where it didn't sound
like you had to do too much incremental spending. So, how much of the incremental spend is that you're seeing more
opportunity to spend, more need to spend versus kind of environmental things that are different? Brazil is getting
tougher. Competition is getting tougher, et cetera.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah, I'll comment and then turn it over to Kimberly. I think from an overall timing perspective,
what we're seeing is some of the spend is shifting between what we saw last year in first half and we're shifting to
second half partly because we're putting it behind the new product innovation and we have a lot of new product
innovation coming in second half. So, some of it has to do with just the timing of our innovation. I think you make the
point, Ali, that it is important to invest behind growth and I completely agree with that and so, what we need to is some
– it's difficult sometimes for us to manage quarter-to-quarter because we're really looking at how we're making sure
we're investing in the long term.
And so, what we see is we do see opportunity in these markets. We're very excited about some of the new innovations
that we have coming. What I want to make sure is that the markets have the right connection between the consumer
proposition, the representative and the right number of representatives on the ground and the right representative's
opportunity. So, what we're trying to do is look at it from that standpoint. We do see more competition in Brazil and
certainly, I want to make sure that we have our best foot forward to make sure that we continue to gain share, because
ultimately we're going to win by growing and making sure that we're delivering the appropriate margins. Kimberly...
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So...
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, and I'd just add to that, again. We do have things like the foreign exchange impact,
because of where the U.S. dollar's moved, which we didn't have before, as well as incentive compensation, which last
year we had big positives coming through that will not hopefully repeat themselves this year. So, it's not just spend
that's up, there are other items that are impacting this also.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: But it does sound – just to Sheri's comment earlier, it does sound like you are spending more. And I
guess my question is around, are you realizing you have to spend more than you thought? And I guess I ask that
particularly in the question of the non-Beauty being the real driver still, so Fashion & Home, still being the big driver
of top-line growth and Beauty kind of lagging. Is that essentially a conscious decision to let things flow through or are
you saying gosh, Beauty is very important to us, you said a second ago, Skincare is very important to us. So, now we
actually have to spend more than we thought, is what I'm trying to get at.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: I don't think this is spending more than we thought and I think part of this is timing, Ali, just
when stuff is coming through. So, it's not like we're suddenly kneejerk reacting to what the competition is doing if that's
kind of what you're getting at. So, it's not that. This is thoughtful spend behind launches that have been planned for a

The next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty. Please state your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Connie Maneaty>: Good morning. It's BMO Capital. I am wondering why after so many quarters of steep sales
declines, you don't close down the business in China and admit as perhaps as Avon did that it got into the market too
late. You closed South Korea for that reason. I mean, what's the point of staying there now?
And my follow-up question is, if you can discuss where you are with the rollout of the one simple sales model in the
U.S.? Are we going to anniversary it soon and what have you learned from it? Thanks so much.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. Thanks, Connie. On China, certainly we see that as a huge market, a huge skincare market
and we were in early. We – I think relative to other national – multinationals. I think the challenge was that as we
struggled with – between a direct selling license and a more retail approach with our Beauty Boutique owners, we made
some strategic changes over the course of many years, which has impacted the business.
Certainly, as we've looked at the business, what we've said is it's really much stronger from a retail standpoint in terms
of the Beauty Boutique owners that they have invested in their stores, they are selling product, and so what we're really
doing is going back and looking at how we rebuild that versus going back and forth between direct selling and the
Beauty Boutique piece.
So it is really a rebuild, but it's such an important market, and Avon, while we've had some impact on the brand over
the course of events for the last several years, we do believe that there is opportunity to rebuild that brand, and so we're
continuing to do, but we want to make sure we're doing it right and I'd rather go slow and get it right, than pour more
money into it. So we're being very cautious and learning about how to drive that because it is a really critical market.
And we do believe we can still compete there as compared to some of the other markets where we've been struggling
for many years with the direct selling approach.
As it relates, just shifting gears to the one simple sales model in the U.S. Again, we have executed that. I think the –
Pablo will be spending time really understanding that. What I will say is that it is a significant change for the field and
so if you look at some of the challenges we've had, I think it's the ability for the field to absorb the significance of the
change and we did a lot of changes in one go and we're still managing through that. And so that's really where he's
diving deep to understand what's the course of action moving forward. And so, we'll get more learning and be able to
update you in the near future. Thanks, Connie.

growth has been higher than theirs, but you have the Home and Fashion (sic) [Fashion & Home], and they don't. It's a

<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, I will start with Silpada. I think pulling out Silpada all in all has a positive impact for
our U.S. business if we look at quarter two. Not a real material impact on profit, but it did impact sales about 40 basis
points. If you look at North America, it was about 100 basis points on sales and it would have been about 40 basis
points on profit.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: If we don't – look at market share, I don't really want to comment specifically about our
competitor per se. I think all in all, we were pleased with the performance that we did have in that market, as I said it
continues to be a competitive market all in all. We don't have the latest and greatest number specifically on the Beauty
share per se. So, I can't really give you any color specifically on that where we are in the market share for the quarter.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. I would just add that as we looked at [ph] Ardivacario (51:39), what we see is them
doing well, both on the franchise front, as well as in direct selling. So, we see [ph] Ardivacario (51:47) doing well in
the direct selling, obviously Natura is like we are continue – more traditional direct selling, and we're pleased with our
performance and we'll continue to monitor it and better understand the dynamics and the overall trends.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Joe B. Lachky>: Hi. Wells Fargo Securities. So, my first, I have kind of two questions here. But the first one, I
guess now that a new CMO has been in place for a while, and has presumably had a chance to kind of review the state
of the business and marketing. Has there been any change in your marketing strategy to kind of redefine and restore the
value of the Avon brand itself, globally?
And then, the second question, I guess this is – at least the second quarter, you've mentioned operational challenges in
the Philippines, and maybe can you describe what those are, and what you're doing to address those issues?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. First, as it relates to the brand itself, our new CMO has certainly done a lot of work in
understanding the essence of the brand, and has put together an approach for us to proceed in terms of getting more
global approach to how we portray the brand. And we're in the process of in many markets evaluating that and/or
rolling that out, so it's – we're starting with the businesses that are more healthy because it makes sense to put more
investment behind those versus some of the businesses that are more challenged, but we're going to be thoughtful in
terms of how we do that, but I think the positive that we see is there's a lot of optimism and goodwill toward the brand
and some of it is just making sure we get it back in the consideration set.
In other cases, it's a more around how do we make it more contemporary in certain markets, so she has taken a good
look at that and certainly will be in the position to share more with you later as we go forward on that front.
As it relates to the Philippines, we've had some executional issues in the field as well as with service and there was
some changes made in the field that we're working our way through as it relates to how we were doing recruiting et
cetera and I think they're all fixable, but it's something that we've got the management very focused on how to address
some of those elements of it. I don't know, Kimberly, if you want to add more on Philippines.

<Q - Greg Hessler>: Hi. Bank of America. The question that I have, leverage was about 2.7 times at the end of the
quarter. You guys have obviously done a good job of de-levering over the past couple of quarters. Should we expect
additional pay down out of Avon or do you guys just plan to kind of de-lever through further EBITDA growth?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: So, we did pay down some of the term notes right after the end of the quarter with the
proceeds of Silpada, which we had announced and we'll continue to obviously be looking at the overall capital structure
as we're going forward. So, we don't have plans right now for additional, say calls of debts or anything like that, but we
did just recently pay down some of the term-loans.
<Q - Greg Hessler>: Okay. And is it still the company's goal to hold on to the investment grade credit rating and have
you had any updated discussions with the rating agency per that goal?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. It is our objective to continue to hold on to the investment grade rating. With that
said, I always caveat that we obviously are not the ones that control the rating agencies, but yes, that is what we are
targeting and we do have regular updates with the rating agencies. We try to talk to them at least every quarter and
then, obviously we have our annual reviews with them.

Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone. Consumer Edge Research. A question for Sheri. You had been
looking at this business for over a year and perhaps, the greatest surprise in my view has been the difficulties in the
U.S. You implemented changes early on, tried to roll out multi-level marketing. And obviously, that – the hope was
that by eliminating district sales managers you would reduce the cost base.
Now, we are seeing increased disruption in the U.S. Part of your plan has been multi-level marketing in Home or
Fashion businesses. So, at the same time that you're getting these problem in the U.S., you are divesting Silpada which
is multi-level marketing on jewelry which is essentially where you wanted to move the business. So, do you have – it
seems to me that those decisions, strategic decisions contradict each other. And now we have a new Tupperware
executive which is not familiar with the Avon business. So what exactly are you thinking nor Mr. Pablo, not Mr.
Martinez-Quiroga about the U.S., what are you thinking has happened in the U.S. and do you think that there is a risk
that you may need to rehire the district sales managers that they were laid off and you are generating savings from their
absence? Thank you.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Thanks, Javier. The most important thing for me and it's applicable to every market that we're in
is that we need to make sure that we are serving the representatives and that they have the appropriate earnings
opportunity. To do that, they have to have the right product and they have to be proud of the brand that they are
representing. And so that's true, no matter where we are in the world. I think one of the challenges that we've had in the
U.S. is really looking at how do we manage the field base so that the representative feels good that they're getting the
earnings opportunity that they're putting the appropriate time for the earnings and that they're rewarded and recognized.
And I think we've struggled with that as we've made some of the changes and you're asking people to do different jobs
and different – take different roles. I think that was more difficult than was anticipated and this has been probably an
18-month journey, and we're getting [ph] right in (58:40) and understanding that piece of it.
The Fashion & Home piece just to get to that question or that part of your concern, to me the Fashion & Home has to
link to Beauty. It has to be a Beauty category focused, so that it really ladders up to the overall essence of the Avon

brand which is Beauty. We – Fashion & Home is important to the representatives and particularly in markets like the
U.S. where she has the opportunity to earn more because she's selling something that's at a higher price. So if she sells a
handbag, it's at a higher price than lipstick. She has that earnings opportunity.
And so, I still think that's very important part as long as it's linked from a Beauty standpoint. The Silpada decision was
a separate decision. Silpada was never really linked into the U.S. business from the standpoint of synergy, it was more
of a party model, higher ended jewelry, but it didn't work relative and there was never a plan, from what I understand.
It was acquired probably in 2010, it was – there was never a plan to link it in. And what we saw there were a number of
issues with that business. It was important for us to divest that business, so that we could focus on the U.S. business,
but that doesn't in any way say that we're not focused on Fashion & Home. So, to me, the key thing is getting the right
representative earning proposition and to do that we need to have the right consumer proposition and the right
branding. And so, that's really how I see it. How we execute is, is part of what I think some of our challenges are and
that's the area that Pablo will be digging into. Thanks, Javier.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: If I get a follow-up, again on the U.S. What I – the part that I don't understand, Sheri, and
excuse me, if I'm thick here, is that I understand what Andrea Jung decisions made, but you have been in the company
over a year, and these are your decisions, not to integrate Silpada and these are your decisions to sell Silpada at a time
when silver prices are going down. So profitability should go up. So, what do you see you personally, not what Andrea
Jung did two years ago, what do you see, you personally that you didn't feel that Silpada could be integrated to Avon,
because this is precisely where theoretically you want to go, you want to go to multi-level marketing, you want to go to
Fashion. And the person that you just hire does a party business which is Silpada. So I'm just completely confused
about your strategy in the U.S. Thank you.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: My strategy was clearly, I made the decision to sell Silpada and I made the decision because I
was going to focus on our core business and I didn't see the amount of investment and what we would need to do to fix
Silpada, didn't make sense compared to some of the other choices that I could make in terms of how I was going to
invest in the business or in the U.S. or in other parts of the world. And I think, you may agree or disagree with the
decision, that was the decision I took and that's the strategy relative to I've been – I think I've been very clear that we're
focusing on our core business and I'm going to continue to focus on our core business. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Leigh Ferst. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Leigh Ferst>: I'm with Wellington Shields. Would you discuss your e-commerce strategy with respect to the
results in the outlook and where you're making progress besides EMEA. Also what effect does it have on the reps when
you go directly to the consumer?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. One of the things that we see and we're looking at this globally, but we – as I've said
before we've made more progress and we're ahead in EMEA. What we see is there is an opportunity to actually, and
you see this in EMEA, the consumer can come on and she has the choice to have the representative actually deliver it to
her or she can get it shipped to her. There are different ways that we can manage that.
I think the key thing that we see is that e-commerce needs to work in concert with the representative and the
representative needs to be rewarded appropriately, but we're continuing to look at different models in terms of what that
reward looks like. And so, that will vary a little bit depending on where we are in the world and what the status of
e-commerce is, but we certainly see that as a big opportunity. We've made a lot of progress in looking at our global
strategy there and we'll be rolling it out in the not too distant future.
<Q - Leigh Ferst>: Can you identify any of the countries or regions where you've made progress and if it's on the
top-line or the bottom-line?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: In terms of e-commerce – is that specific to e-commerce?

<Q - Leigh Ferst>: Yes, example, more examples.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: No, yeah, it's mainly – mainly if I would – it's small in terms of the amount of revenue that comes
from e-commerce. We have e-commerce sites in different parts of the world, it's very small. The area where it's more
integrated today, we're just rolling that out in Eastern Europe and we'll be rolling it out in Australia. So, we'll be able to
monitor that over time.
