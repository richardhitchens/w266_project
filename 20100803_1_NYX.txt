MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2010 NYSE Euronext Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] We will be facilitating a
question-and-answer session toward the end of this conference call. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, Head of Investors Relations at NYSE Euronext. Please go
ahead, sir.
Stephen C. Davidson, Vice President-Investor Relations

We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures during this call. These non-GAAP measures are fully reconciled and the
tables attached to the text of the earnings press release that we issued earlier today. We believe that these tables provide
investors useful information about our business trends. However, our non-GAAP measures do not replace and are not
superior to GAAP measures.
For the call today, Duncan Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and our 2010
priorities, walk you through several technology wins and conclude with a refresher on our corporate strategy and an
update on the regulatory landscape. Michael Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer, will then review the financial results
for the quarter. We will then open the line for your questions. Also on the call today for the Q&A session is Larry
Leibowitz, Chief Operating Officer.
When we go to the Q&A session, please limit your questions to one to allow for broader participation. We are
incorporating slides to the call today, which are available for reviewing on our website, and Duncan and Mike will refer
to the slides during their remarks.
With that, let me turn the call over to Duncan.
Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, David, and good morning, everybody. Thanks again for joining the call this morning. Just an early notice; we'll
be doing the next one of these from Paris, so look for us to do the third quarter earnings review from there. The good
news for all of you is we won't be doing it at 8:00 a.m. Paris time. We'll probably continue to do it at 8:00 a.m. New
York time.
I'm going to start with Slide 3 in the deck and just hit a few highlights on that slide.
I think you can see from the slide and from the press release this morning, we had a very strong second quarter. We're
growing our Derivatives business. We're stabilizing our Cash Equities business, and we're providing innovative
technology solutions in that business. Our results, which reflect the continued trend of improving financial
performance, were driven by stronger trading volumes, increased revenue generation from our new initiatives and
continued cost discipline.
We recorded a 25% increase in EPS, the $0.64 per share, and a 15% increase in operating income on 7% increase in net
revenue with incremental margins of 76%. These results reflect the growing earnings power from our three primary
businesses and the inherent operating leverage in the model.
Firstly, our Derivatives segment benefited from record trading volumes, as well as the addition of NYSE Liffe
Clearing. During the month of May, we executed an average of 13 million contracts per day across our global
Derivatives businesses, driving a 34% increase in net revenue with an increase in our operating margins of 62%, up
from 42% the prior year. We were the largest U.S. equities options exchange for the second consecutive quarter.
Turning to Cash and Listings. In the first half of 2010, we continue to see strong demand for our Listing venues, both in
terms of transfers and new listings. On the Execution side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability of
this business. In the U.S. our market share in Tape A is at 37%, up from 35% in the first quarter. And our share in
Europe is holding steady at 74%.
Additionally on July 13, we've launched trading on Tape C stocks on an Unlisted Trading Privilege basis over the
NYSE Amex platform. Trading began with 10 issues and now has expanded to approximately 675 NASDAQ-listed
issues, and we've seen some positive market share developments.
Lastly, our Technology business benefited from the addition of NYFIX and improved Software sales, driving a 29%
increase in revenue and an increase in operating margin to 19%. I will walk you through the profiles of several deals
that we've signed in the past few months later in the presentation. They are representative of the enterprise-level
dialogues that we are having with market participants, encouraging them to leverage our technology to help them run
their businesses more efficiently. As we invest in our future growth and drive our revenue generation, we are

maintaining strong expense discipline as well. Our fixed operating expenses in the second quarter on a constant dollar
basis were down 29 million or 7% from the prior-year period.
Before I move to Slide 4, let me touch briefly on a few select business highlights for the quarter. Building upon our
success with the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing last July, we have announced our intention to build two new
clearinghouses in London and Paris for our European Derivatives and Cash businesses.
The economics for Clearing are very favorable, and it is our intention to have the new clearinghouses live by
mid-to-late '12. We continue to await regulatory approval of our NYSE Amex options and NYTC semi-mutualizations.
In terms of NYPC, we now have a full management team in place. The intensive regulatory review and approval
process for NYPC continues to make progress, and we appreciate all the regulatory agencies for the substantial
resources they are committing to thoroughly really analyze this innovative, new Clearing model.
Given the recent focus on clearinghouses and risk in the newly enacted financial regulatory reform bill, regulators are
being appropriately diligent in their analysis, and we are still hoping for regulatory approvals later in the fall. Our
agreement with FINRA under which they assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and
enforcement functions, previously conducted by NYSE regulation, is effective. And we believe this agreement is an
important step towards consolidated market surveillance, the need for which was highlighted in the events of May 6.
I am pleased to report that our data center migration is on track. We are establishing the liquidity hubs of the future, and
Mike will address the timing of the incremental depreciation and amortization for the second half of 2010. Lastly, as
we committed to on our last quarter's call, we have continued to de-lever. And year-to-date, we have reduced our
outstanding debt by more than $0.5 million.
In summary, while we are pleased with our strong results for the quarter, driven by higher volumes across most of our
venues and a growing base of recurring Technology Services revenue, we still have much to do. We are focused on
executing against our long-term strategy of operating the most meaningful capital markets, creating even broader and
deeper networks of connectivity and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. We have and will
continue to redefine what an exchange is in the 21st Century.
Please turn to Slide 4. The priorities on this slide highlight our goal of creating a community premium using our scale
and scope to the benefit not only our own business, but our customers' businesses as well. We can achieve this through
initiatives and offerings like co-location, co-branding, advocacy and our global distribution network. At the center of
the company and in support of our three businesses is UTP our globally integrated and scalable trading platform, an
unrivaled global connectivity network and customer gateway. Our focus on Clearing, which will take on an even
greater importance in '11 and '12 and two brand new world-class data centers set for launch in September and October
of this year.
Turning to Slide 5, we have several recent NYSE Technology wins, which reflect the growing interest in our full
managed solution capabilities. The Technology business, as I alluded to earlier, has performed well to-date, and
approximately 80% of the revenues in this business are recurring.
On the Exchange Partnerships side of the business, we continue to land large client deals. As you will recall, last year
we singed a partnership with the Qatar Exchange to build their cash and derivatives platforms. And just a few weeks
ago, we singed a multiyear, eight-figure deal with the Warsaw Stock Exchange to migrate WSE's Cash and Derivatives
markets to NYSE Technologies Universal Trading Platform. In addition, we plan to collaborate with the WSE on other
mutually beneficial business initiatives.
Regarding the more traditional client side, you will note on the chart a few examples of deals that we've recently
signed. Despite reports of slowing Technology spend, we are seeing strong interest from the broker-dealer community,
investing in leading-edge trading technology. This is welcome sign, especially after a slow 2009 that saw a decent
pullback in Technology spend.
Our customers are looking to leverage our full solution set. We believe the deals shown on this slide represent just the
beginning of our ability to deliver innovative products, and these opportunities will only get larger as we deliver.

Supporting many of these deals are our data centers. There is a lot of customer focus on the upcoming Mahwah and
Basildon go-live dates set for later this year.
On Slide 6, we've included a simple strategy statement to help you better understand where we're going. Our aspiration
is to lead our industry and redefine what it means to be an exchange in the 21st Century. To achieve this, our mission
will be simply to empower the world's capital markets communities to innovate and collaborate. To achieve this, our
core objectives will be to operate the most important capital markets, connect the members of the community through
our ever-growing network, deliver innovative products to our continually expanding client base. And to enable
customers to run their businesses more profitably by using our technology and the scale the UTP and the data centers
deliver.
We have already gone a long way towards redefining what an exchange is, and we've moved from being just an
operator of markets to much more. As many companies and other industries have done, we are moving across the value
chain to improve our competitive position. The more customers and partners we have, the greater the network effect,
which further validates the relevance of our community.
In short, it is about getting more customers for our products and services and more products and services for our
customers. From our perspective, we think the sum of the parts is being undervalued because we believe that our
unique collection of assets and global reach offers us great revenue and cost synergies, which will ultimately yield the
community premium that I mentioned earlier.
Finally for me on Slide 7, you will see a number of current issues where we are doing our best to demonstrate
leadership. We will not go through each of these bullets individually this morning, but we'll highlight a few important
ones. While Congress considered financial regulatory reform legislation, we were very active in advocating for
ourselves and more importantly, on behalf of our listed companies. We believe that the Dodd-Frank Act will solidify
and bolster our opportunities for future growth, particularly in Derivatives.
Going forward, the Act mandates hundreds of agency rule-makings, and we are already analyzing and prioritizing these
rules and expect to play an active advocacy role on behalf of our clients. But also are committed to being an active
participant with the regulators who are going to have to write all these rules.
In terms of market structure, the events of May 6 put a spotlight on the need for improvements to our equity markets.
This has created opportunities for us to demonstrate the benefits that the NYSE model brings to issuers, investors and
the markets. We testified twice before Congress on market structure matters, and we spent considerable time with the
SEC, the CFTC and the Joint Advisory Committee. We believe these opportunities have enhanced our standing with
legislative and regulatory policymakers.
More broadly, our efforts to advocate on behalf of our issuers and to be an influencer of public policy continue to be an
important part of our value proposition. We're working hard to represent our listed companies on issues like corporate
governance, proxy access and Sarbanes-Oxley reform. As well as our continued opposition on a tax on transactions to
ensure that investors' interests are protected as well.
Turning to Europe, regulators are also embarking on a plethora of legislative initiatives on both market structure and
financial regulation. Two years after its implementation, European policymakers are working on a comprehensive
review of MiFID, although we don't expect firm proposals until early next year. We are hopeful that officials in Europe
will learn some important lessons from the market fragmentation that has occurred in the U.S. and will avoid heading
down the same path.
We will also be working with European legislators to ensure an adequate assessment of the increasingly high level of
non-transparent trading. We believe that a proper analysis of this issue calls for priority to be given to a more
transparent price formation process and increased investor protection.
Derivatives regulation is also a key issue in Europe, as has been the case in the U.S. The European Commission will
publish legislative proposals in September in keeping with the G-20 commitments before central clearing of OTC
derivatives trades. It is our understanding that the Commission will present proposals next year as part of the MiFID

revision to bring more OTC Derivatives onto central Liffe platforms.
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Mike for a review of our quarter's financial results. Mike?
Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice
President
Thanks, Duncan. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat
year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue, profit and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter. The $0.70 EPS posted in the second quarter was the company's highest quarterly EPS since Q3
2008. Unless otherwise noted, all of our financials are presented in accordance with GAAP.
As we progress through latter stages of the post-merger integration, staff reduction and system harmonization efforts,
we continue to incur high levels of severance charges, asset write-offs and real estate disposition costs. These discrete
items are reported in merger and exit costs. Once we move into the new data centers and exit our legacy premises, we
expect the occurrence of these costs to decline significantly.
This quarter, we reported a $32 million charge in merger and exit costs. This consisted of 14 million in cash charges,
primarily for severance related to the FINRA transaction, reengineering the structure of local offices and the U.S. VRIP
[Voluntary Resignation Incentive Program]. The remainder is related to real estate lease cancellations and disposal of
legacy system applications.
Last year's merger costs of 442 million was principally for the NYSE Liffe Clearing payment, which drove the GAAP
loss for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported a $54 million gain from asset disposals, primarily related to the sale of
our 5% stake in the National Stock Exchange of India.
Now a review of financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs,
just referenced, as well as the gains from disposal activities during the quarters.
Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the second quarter. Excluding merger and exit costs
and the assets sales, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up 25% on prior year's $0.51. Year-to-date EPS of $1.18 is
up 26%. Q2 earnings performance was driven by a 7% increase in net revenues and another quarter of solid expense
management.
Operating income was 247 million, up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Operating margin rose to 38% this
quarter and is 36% year-to-date. This compares with a full-year operating margin of 32% for 2009. Our focus for 2010
is revenue growth and margin expansion, and we are pleased with our progress on both fronts. We continue to grow
EBITDA margin as well, posting a 48% mark for the quarter. The relatively fixed expense base, we have significant
operating leverage on our incremental revenue and volume growth.
Slide 10 provides our segment results on a currency-neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter versus both
the euro and British pound. For the quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds.
Currency impact was unfavorable, 19 million versus prior year, and 22 million versus prior quarter. On a
currency-neutral basis, second quarter net revenues grew 10% and operating income 20% versus Q2 prior year.
Operationally, our Derivatives segment grew 38% and Technology segment grew 33% versus Q2 prior year. Cash
Trading and Listings revenue declined by 8%, attributed to lower revenues from BlueNext, our carbon trading venture,
and lower U.S. volumes and revenue capture in Europe. Our Derivatives and Technology profits nearly doubled versus
Q2 prior year.
On Slide 11, we show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segment, with comparisons from
the first half of 2009. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base. 51% of our net revenues were
generated by Transaction and Clearing fees in the first half of 2010. This is slightly higher than last year because of the
strong Q2 volumes in 2010, and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We saw the contribution from Technology

Services showed the most meaningful increase during the first half of 2010, with specific gains stemming from NYFIX,
growth in our SFTI Europe network and recent Software and Infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments, Cash Trading and Listings comprised 48% of our net revenues in the first half of 2010. But
the Derivatives segment continued to be the fastest growing segment, contributing 35% of our net revenues; up from
27% in the first half of 2009. Followed by the Technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenues. Again,
this is consistent with our revenue guidance and where we have invested in new initiatives.
Slides 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our global Derivatives segment. I'm not going to go through these
slides in detail, but simply touch upon a few points. Our global Derivative franchise continues to grow. Net revenues
were 226 million in the second quarter, an increase of 57 million or 34% versus Q2 prior year, and about 38%
year-to-date.
The increase was primarily driven by a $51 million increase in Trading and Clearing revenues due to strong volume
growth in European Derivatives and U.S. Options, increased market share for U.S. Options and the addition of NYSE
Liffe Clearing. Both our European Derivatives and U.S. Options venues experienced record volume days in the second
quarter. For the quarter, volumes rose 38% and 57%, respectively, versus Q2 prior year.
For one day in May, we handled over 16 million Derivative contracts globally. NYSE Euronext was the largest U.S.
equity options exchange operator in the marketplace for the second consecutive quarter with a market share of 26%.
The revenue captured for European Derivatives, ex-Bclear was $0.64 per contract in the second quarter. This was up
versus the second quarter of last year due to the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing, but down slightly versus the first
quarter because of the stronger dollar.
Rate per contract in U.S. Options was $0.17 per contract in the second quarter. This is down versus both the prior year
and prior quarter. The reason for the decrease is largely attributable to an increase in penny-pilot issues traded on
NYSE Arca, and minor pricing changes which were offset by market share gains.
Our global Derivatives segment increased its margins to 62% in Q2, as we were able to leverage volume and revenue
growth on a lower cost base. The first half of 2010, this segment accounted for 50% of our operating income.
Similarly, Slides 14 and 15 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading
and Listings net revenue was 321 million in the second quarter of 2010, down versus last year, but up sequentially
versus the first quarter. The year-over-year decrease was driven by a $21 million decline in net transaction revenue and
a $14 million decline in other revenue.
Decline in net transaction revenue was attributed to pricing reductions of European cash in 2009 and lower trading
volumes in U.S. cash. This was somewhat mitigated by an 18% increase in European volumes during the quarter.
Decline in other revenue was principally due to a decrease in volumes on BlueNext, our environmental trading
exchange. However, we are actively looking at opportunities to build upon our BlueNext franchise and bolster our
carbon trading operations.
Market share in the Euronext primary markets was up slightly to 74% in the second quarter but below the 79% in the
second quarter of 2009. Revenue capture for U.S. cash was $0.03 or 100 shares, in-line with expectations and recent
trends. Revenue capture for European cash was $0.65 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior year. The decline was
attributed to the stronger dollar and a less favorable mix, in part due to higher volumes.
NYSE Euronext global Listings franchise gathered momentum in the first half of 2010. Total of nine companies with a
combined market capital of over 30 billion have transferred from other exchanges to NYSE. Some of these companies
include Knight Capital Group, Charles Schwab, Paragon Shipping. Furthermore, a total of 55 IPOs, the total proceeds
of 13 billion listed on our markets during the first six months of the year.
Operating margin for the Cash Trading and Listings segments was 39% in the second quarter, up from 34% in Q1 and
virtually flat with the second quarter of 2009.

Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segments.
Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was 107 million in the second quarter, an increase of 24
million or 29% from Q2 prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the NYFIX acquisition, growth in SFTI
clients and some large Software and Infrastructure sales. Revenues were slightly behind Q1, and on a currency-neutral
basis grew 2%.
Operating income was 20 million, a 67% increase to prior year and a 18% increase from the first quarter of 2010.
Operating margin was 19% compared to 14% in the second quarter of '09, and 15% in Q1. Adjusted EBITDA margin
was 26%. Advanced cabinet reservations for our new U.S. and U.K. data centers continue to be strong, with both data
centers nearly fully subscribed for cabinet space.
Co-location revenues will begin to accelerate in the fourth quarter and reach their annualized level in Q2 2011 once we
complete the application migrations to the new data centers. Data centers are set to go live in Mahwah in September
and Basildon in October.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We continue to make excellent progress in lowering
our cost base in real terms, while funding incremental investments to grow the business. Q2 expenses were $20 million
below the first quarter. After adjusting for favorable impact of the stronger dollar and for incremental data center
integration spending, fixed costs were 15 million below Q1 on an apples-to-apples basis.
Second quarter operating expenses were up 10 million versus last year on a reported basis. Q2 2009 included a
one-time $10 million benefit curtailment related to the changes made to our retiree benefit plan. After adjusting for this,
FX and the impact of acquisitions such as NYSE Liffe Clearing and NYFIX, fixed operating costs were down 29
million or 7% from the second quarter 2009.
Looking at the first half of 2010 on a constant-dollar, constant-portfolio basis, our underlying fixed expenses were
down 71 million or 9% compared to the first half of 2009. Continue to make good progress, and are focused on
efficiency and productivity improvements that will further reduce operating expenses for NYSE Euronext.
Slide 18 provides an update to our annual expense guidance. In March, when we provided fixed expense guidance for
2010, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average FX rates for 2009. These were $1.39 for the euro
and $1.57 for the pound. Given the direction of rates in the first half, we felt it appropriate to adjust our full-year
guidance to reflect a scenario more in-line with current currency trends. Applying the rate of 1.30 for the euro and 1.50
for the pound, our revised fixed cost range is now between 1,685 and 1,729 million. Likewise, should these rates be
applicable for 2011, our prior guidance of cost to be below 1,650 million, would be adjusted accordingly.
In the second quarter, 60% of our operating expenses were denominated in dollars, 20% in euros and 20% in pounds.
Although we have adjusted the cost range solely for currency, our first-half expense performance of 834 million,
coupled with efficiency initiatives in the pipelines, provides us increasing comfort that we will achieve our cost
guidance for 2010.
Our staffing level as of June 30 is 2,993 full-time positions, which is 374 positions, or 11% below year-end levels.
Approximately 165 of these reductions relate to the recent outsourcing of certain regulatory activities of FINRA.
Approximately $11 million per quarter in compensation expense related to this head count transfer will now be
reflected in Professional Services line. For the most part, the social plan and U.S. VRIP programs have now been fully
executed and are complete.
We continue to pursue a number of process efficiency improvements, which will further reduce expenses into 2011.
That said, we do expect costs to rise somewhat in the second half, attributable to migration into our new data centers,
investments in our new European clearinghouses and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. In addition to the
integration and transition costs, we expect to begin depreciating the new data centers as they go live in the latter part of
the third quarter, adding incremental depreciation costs of approximately $15 million in the second half. Over time, this
will be mitigated as we exit some legacy data centers.

Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2010. After investing a significant amount of capital towards
building two state-of-the-art data centers, insourcing Liffe Clearing, restructuring operations and investing in other
avenues of growth, we indicated late last year that our focus will be on de-levering our balance sheet. In just six
months, we have made significant progress towards these goals, and are now operating well within our long-term target
leverage levels.
Our debt leverage this quarter has declined to slightly below 1.9 times debt-to-EBITDA versus 2.6 times at year-end
2009. This improvement is the result of double-digit growth in EBITDA, coupled with significant debt repayment.
During the second quarter our growth debt declined 434 million to 2.2 billion. Proceeds from the disposition of NSE,
coupled with strong operating cash flows, enabled the sizable repayment of short-term debt. Cash and other financial
instruments was 419 million at the end of June 2010. This compares favorably to our short-term debt, which is now
below 300 million.
The second quarter of 2010, capital expenditures were $70 million, of which 26 million was for building out our data
centers. Having reached our comfort zone with regard to the leverage, we are revisiting how best to allocate capital
going forward besides just paying down debt. This will entail investing for growth and possibly returning excess cash
flows to our shareholders.
We are comfortable with the dividend at current levels, as the payout ratio remains above pre-crisis levels. But we still
have an outstanding share buyback authorization. We are currently rated AA-minus by S&P and A3 by Moody's. The
S&P rating is under credit watch, which we expect will be addressed shortly. And finally, last week, the board declared
a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of 2010, which is payable on September 30.
With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks, and then we'll take your questions.
Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Mike. So just to recap, we're obviously very pleased with our results for the quarter. I think they were strong,
driven by record trading volumes on our Derivatives franchise and year-over-year growth in Technology Services
revenue from NYFIX. I think we also continued to show cost discipline during the quarter, and we remained focused
on proceeding with our company-wide efficiency efforts that will address globalizing our operations, reducing process
complexity and streamlining organizational constructs. We are on the cusp of concluding a multi-year project with the
lighting up of our new data centers, which we expect will serve as a cornerstone of our Technology Services growth
story.
We are signing more major client deals and establishing more commercial exchange partnerships than ever before,
based on the superior quality and breadth of technology assets that we have brought together with our organic
development and acquisition the past couple of years. And we have several other new initiatives that are in the wings
that will drive our future growth, including NYPC and our European Clearing initiatives, set for later on in '11 and '12.
With these initiatives, we are indeed redefining what it means to be an exchange in the 21st Century.
So with that, we'll wrap it up, and we'd like to open the line for your questions. Thanks for listening.

[Operator's instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Roger Freeman of Barclays Capital. Roger, you
may proceed.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Oh, hi. Good morning. I guess – let's see, for my one question; tough to pick one. I guess
going back to May 6, what role, maybe Duncan and/or Larry, did market data sort of, would you say, play in the whole

thing in terms of any lag in that? Because it seems like pretty much all the other exchanges declared self help against
Arca, and it sounded like maybe there were some delays in Wombat. And I'm guessing – my question is, do you have
spending to do to enhance capacity there, or is that getting taken care of with the new data center?
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: So first, not all the exchanges declared self help against Arca. I think that's just flat out
wrong. What happened was NASDAQ declared self help against Arca, which lasted 20 minutes. We believe that was
due to a server latency on about 20 symbols that lasted five minutes.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Tape C.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: In Tape C. The other exchanges didn't. BATS declared self-help for about seven minutes.
That was due to the fact that some of the prices they were sending us violated our price band. And when we spoke to
them on the phone, they cleared that up relatively quickly.
Our direct feeds did not experience latency, as far as we know, in terms of market data. There were some issues
potentially on the SIP, meaning the consolidated feed. But probably about 85 or 90% of our volume actually comes
from direct feeds. That's another misinformation that's generally in the market, which is that in general, consolidated
feeds go to retail customers. And people who are viewing it with their eyeballs, most volume actually is generated from
direct feeds.
That said, that period we experienced a tripling of quotes and trades during that burst of about five minutes when the
May 6 event occurred. Those were record volumes of message traffic. And I think that we always keep an eye on
capacity and have made – we're actually in the process of some capacity expansion on the May 6 date that has
subsequently been completed. I think it's something that we're always careful about. Volumes are down a bit. Again,
after the second quarter, I think everybody has seen July, but that's partly seasonally. But I think it's something that
we're just always cognizant of and always reviewing.
Operating: And our next question comes from line of Michael Carrier of Deutsche Bank. Michael, you may proceed.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Thanks, guys. Just a question on the expense side, obviously a great quarter. And you guys
continue to take down expenses, and you got a little bit of help on the FX side. I think the one thing we struggle with is
when we look at the top line growth, when you look at sequentially, when volumes are up 10 to 30% across products.
The top line growth was like 1%; if you ex-out the FX, maybe 4 or 5%. It just seems like it might be a while until we're
in an environment where we see the volumes that we saw in the second quarter.
So just trying to understand, when you look over the next, call it four quarters or so, where do you see the most I guess
non-volume growth? And maybe on the data center or the Tech side, if you can just give us any clarity on those Co-lo
revenues on an annualized basis once we get into the second quarter of 2011? Like where we should be or what we
should expect, just so we can understand where some of the growth will come from? Thanks.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: All right. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Mike, why don't
you address sort of what the year-on-year numbers actually were, with and without the currency, because I think
whether it was 7% or 10% on equity. We'll ask Larry to talk about. Obviously, it's hard to predict revenues out four
quarters when we don't know volumes and volatility and currency rates. But I think we can at least talk about where we
think some of the new sources of revenue are going to going come from on the data center side, Co-Lo, et cetera.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President>: Sure.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: So, Mike -
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President>: Yeah. So our – as we
mentioned, our reported revenues grew 7% and – over this quarter last year, and on a currency-neutral basis were up
10%. And we did indicate when you compare our Q2 revenues versus Q1 revenues, it was a $22 million dollar negative
FX. When you factor that in, Q2, we're sizably ahead of Q1. So it think -
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: You want to talk about it on revenue...

<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Sure. I mean, I think in terms of Technology Services, obviously Co-Lo will be a larger
revenue source in the future. We have not been as granular on Co-Lo revenues, but think of it this way. First, Arca was
out of space for Co-Lo. It will no longer be out space. And second of all, New York – the NYSE Classic side didn't
actually have Co-Lo. So we're adding a new Co-Lo revenue source. And likewise in Europe, the whole Co-Lo concept,
particularly on the cash side, is relatively new. So those are clearly sources of growth.
But what they're also fueling along the way, as you saw in some of the deals we outlined, is a general turning to the
market centers for infrastructure support. While it's on their trading hub and their market data hubs, some of that is
related to Co-Lo, but a lot of it really is just a matter of helping them outsource those capabilities to us.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Rich, you may proceed.
<Q - Richard Repetto>: Yeah. Good morning, guys.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Rich.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President>: Rich.
<Q - Richard Repetto>: Yeah. My one question is on guidance, I guess, and if you'd pull the guidance up. So you've
outlined some wins on the Technology side. But I'm just trying to see how that – how is that progressing against the 1
billion and 30% margins in 2015? And in this guidance, like the guidance on expenses of 2011, any color there? My
one question.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: So – thanks, Rich. In terms of the Technology side, Dominique Cerutti is not on our call
this morning, so I'll make promises on his behalf. He made the statement, 1 billion over three to five years. We don't
see anything that would change that horizon. We're confident and, in fact if anything, we get growing confidence that
this business model action makes sense. That we can – we see that there is the need on the sell side in particular to help
manage these processes as they help manage their own cost basis. Now we just have to execute and deliver on it, and
that's our jobs to do. But I think that we're feeling good about all of that.
And I think as time rolls out, we'll probably be even more transparent about the different avenues of those businesses
and where they're coming from. But I think that the deals that we showed you on the slide, as well as Warsaw, are
meant to be sort of case studies of the sorts of things that we can do. And in some ways, each of these deals is we – it's
sort of the tip-of-the-iceberg deal, which is you start by managing a particular service for a client. You show that you
can actually do it. You show that your technology works. You show that you give good enough service. And then you
should be able to expand the kinds of services you can do for them because they're sort of related into their value chain.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President>: To follow up for a
second, as well. I mean I think we threw out some large deals and some numbers. But the revenue recognition of these
is over time. For instance, the Warsaw transaction is mostly a 2011 transaction; very – very little benefit this year, even,
because it's a long-term agreement.
And I think secondly, by showing the margins at 19%, as we had indicated, we should start to see the margins get
closer to our goals even before we get to the $1 billion of revenue. And I think we made some progress this quarter.
On 2011 expense guidance, your other question, I mean basically always right out there is previous guidance was less
than 1,650. You can extrapolate that we took our bands down by 38 million. For this year, we didn't really redo the
1,650. But what we're saying is that there would be – if the currency stayed at today's levels, which is lower than when
we – the levels that we're at when we indicated the 1,650, we will be that much below the 1,650 as well. We just didn't
want to – we just didn't restate it or recalculate that at this stage.

And our next question comes from the line of Celeste Brown of Morgan Stanley. Celeste, you may proceed.
<Q - Celeste Brown>: Hi, guys. Good morning.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Celeste Brown>: Once you got regulatory approval for NYPC, how long will it take you to launch the service?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: I don't think it'll take that long just to; manage your
expectations, two or three threads here. One is, obviously, the Technology build that had to be done, that's been going
at pace. That's ahead of schedule now that the regulatory approval's been a little bit slower than we would have
anticipated a few months ago. So the Technology work for this is well underway and will be delivered, I would say
now comfortably, ahead of any approval we would get. Because remember, the comment period will be roughly 90
days.
So assuming that there's no glitches there, which we don't anticipate, and that the clients we want connected or who are
already in the process of connecting are connecting, we'd be able to turn this on very, very quickly after approval.
Realistically, I think we have to start thinking about this in our own minds as a January of 2011 event because even if
we went out for comment this month and got all the requisite approvals by the end of the year, I wouldn't anticipate that
we would launch something like this the first or second week of December. I think we'd probably get advice from our
clients that would say, let's come out of the gate after the new year ready to go.
So we would suggest that other than the kind of calendar stuff I just talked about, the Technology and connectivity,
which would be the other two things you would want to have ready, will absolutely be ready by the time we get the
approval.

And our next question comes from the line of Howard Chen of Credit Suisse. Howard, you may proceed.
<Q - Howard Chen>: Hi, everyone. Good morning.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Howard.
<Q - Howard Chen>: Switching gears to the European cash, was just hoping you could give a bit more color on what
drove the revenue capture trends during the quarter? And now that we're past a lot of the craziness within Europe, what
you'd anticipate in terms of what we'd sort of see there going forward?
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Well, I think what was driven in terms of the year-over-year comparison is really the fact
that we had made some pricing changes over the year. And, in fact, there's some tiering mix issues and things like that.
And that's always the challenge. I think what we're trying to do, both in Europe and particularly in the U.S. going
forward, is have our tiering float more appropriately with market volumes to try to insulate both us and our clients, to
be honest, from getting stuck in a higher tier if volumes drop off. And likewise, get pushed into a lower tier if volumes
explode and try to sort of mitigate some of that. And we've implemented that.
In addition, by the way it's evolved over time, the European pricing model is overly complex because we have this
whole agency-principal designation. It's a very complicated system. And we're working right now with our clients on a
way to make that simpler because it'll make them – easier for them to make their routing decisions and figure out how
they're going to run their business because the reality is what they want is to be able to understand what their rates are
going to be. And not have them just come out in a certain place based on either volumes or mixes of business or
likewise.

In terms of volumes, obviously, we don't – we can't do any forecasting there. Your guess is as good as ours. What we
kind of note, particularly in the U.S. is, while July was down versus the previous month as we've seen. On one hand,
June is always a very seasonably busy quarter because of Russell and other things. And July for 2010 was higher than
July of 2009. So what conclusions you can draw from there are beyond me.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Ed Ditmire of Macquarie. Ed, you may proceed. Ed, your line is open.
You may proceed.
<Q - Edward Ditmire>: Sorry about that. Just wanted to ask a question on the operating margins. At the Investor Day
earlier this year, you said that you should be able to hit a 40% margin within a couple of years. And I know we're
actually quite close to that today. Any changes to your margin outlook, either as far as timing to that target or what you
see beyond that?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President>: Yeah. I said – I mean at
the time when we presented that, we said for 2009 we were at 32% margin. Think we have a slide that went through
both our revenue growth outlook for our three segments, as well as our margin expansion for those three. And we used
the word medium. If you extrapolate that, medium, although we didn't say 40, people have been calculating that; it's
about 40% by 2011.
As I mentioned, we're at 36% year-to-date for this year. We're definitely focused on growing revenues and reducing
costs, which would certainly help your margins. And we're at 38% this quarter. So I wouldn't say we're changing that
outlook. I mean you're going to have quarters where the volumes are strong and your margins are going to be that much
stronger. I wouldn't extrapolate the second quarter as being our run rate because we did have pretty strong volumes. But
with 36% year-to-date, I think we're on track to higher margins than we had last year, and certainly are moving in the
direction of our guidance.
<Q - Edward Ditmire>: Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex, you may proceed.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Hey. Good morning. I want to shift gears quickly to maybe your over-the-counter strategy. I
mean, you mentioned the Dodd-Frank Act earlier. So I'm wondering how you could really fit in here. If I look at maybe
the short-term opportunities; Clearing, you don't really have any sort of real assets at this point. So maybe at least
trading or new-listed products. And then perhaps – and maybe this is like a real potential for you as well here is the
technology side. Is there maybe an opportunity to run some of these swap execution facilities or host them in the data
centers? So maybe in general, how are you thinking about your way to participate in the over-the-counter exchange
migration?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Alex, it's Duncan. I think you've got three interesting
topics, probably, and I would put them in their reverse order in terms of near-term relevance for us. I think given the
success we're having hosting various facilities and components of other firms' infrastructure in the liquidity centers, I
would say there's a good near-term opportunity for us to at least be a provider of some Technology Services there.
On the Listings side, I suppose there's an interesting near-term opportunity to list some of these products. I don't know
how near term it's going to be because I think it's going to take a while for all this to be codified. But also, I continue to
be of the belief that there's opportunities in Clearing and market data before there are opportunities in trading. So I
think there might be some kind of a data opportunity for us, but I don't know how much of an opportunity there's going
to be for listing these various products. I don't think they're going to be that actively traded in the near term.

Lastly, you're absolutely right. I think our view is to be a force in OTC to Derivative Clearing. You need to own the
assets. I think we're on the way to owning potential assets with the clearinghouse build-outs in Europe and the NYPC
build-out here in the U.S. But we've said publicly before, short of actually owning those assets, it's difficult to play
overall if you don't have the clearinghouse assets. So as you would correctly expect, that's part of the reason behind us
trying to build out some of these Clearing assets because it's then limitless to products we can clear in those houses.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Ken, you may proceed.
<Q - Kenneth Worthington>: Hi. Good morning. I know this is a small business for you, but market share and cash
equities have stabilized in the U.S. Do you think you're generally at equilibrium? And if so, what does it take to see
market share shifts from here? And in Europe, how close are the cash markets to price and market share equilibrium?
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Sure. That's a good question. I think that we're at a temporary equilibrium where you sort
of swing a couple percentage points in either direction in the U.S. But there are new entrants coming in, in terms of
models. NASDAQ just announced their – or put through their Philly model. There are going to be innovations around
there. This is a competitive business, and we don't sit here and assume that we are where we are. We know that this is
just going to be a fight that doesn't end.
I think in Europe, it's much more of a developing situation. It'll depend partly on the results of the MiFID review. It'll
partly depend on developments in Clearing, whether that's consolidation or interoperability. And so that – we're earlier
in the game there. So I think that that's how we view both of those markets.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Right. And the only thing I might add on the U.S. side to
what Larry said is I suppose there's a greater than zero chance that with the concept release out for a comment and
everyone still assessing what happened in the wake of May 6, it's possible, Ken, that you could see a couple of – I don't
think they'd be monumental changes. But I think you could see a couple of incremental changes that certainly would
help change that equilibrium a little bit, potentially in our favor. But we're not sitting here expecting any major changes
that would kind of create a new order.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Rob Rutschow of CLSA. Rob, you may proceed.
<Q - Rob Rutschow>: Hey. Good morning. You've done a nice job cutting head count down, I think, over 500
year-over-year. Can you give us an idea of once you get through all of the data center build-out and to more of an
equilibrium I guess type business model, what sort of head count should we expect? And what might be some of the
movement between the different business lines and geographically?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Well I'll start, and then I'll ask Larry to add a little bit on the
Technology side. But I think, Rob, what we said to our board most recently is the head count of the overall company on
a pro forma basis is – has gone from north of 5,000 to around 3,000. I could see it going down a little bit from here. I
wouldn't expect much movement the balance of this year because remember, as we finish the UTP migration and we're
lighting up the new data centers, which then puts us in position to decommission the older data centers. I wouldn't
expect too much change in the status quo on our head count now for the balance of this year.
I think there is a possibility that when UTP is done and when all the data center migration and decommissioning is
done, you could see another leg down. But I don't think we want to anticipate that because at the same time, we've got a
Technology Services business that is growing and does require a different kind of potentially consultative sales force.
So you could see us add some people there. So I would say in the near term, those trends kind of offset.

Now a lot of the operational efficiency gains that were talked – that I referenced earlier in my remarks, I think could
lead to some head count changes on the margin. But a lot of those initiatives are simply just streamlining processes that
don't really impact head count at all. But Leibow, what would you add to that on the Tech side, anything?
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: I agree. I think this year there won't be much. Although to be really honest, I had set a
aspirational goal for the team about two years ago. And at the time, I got some icy stares from the Technology guys,
and they've actually achieved it. I think that we will be going down further as the data centers finish, as UTP finalizes
and as we're globalizing operations, remember. We have the Belfast initiative. A lot of that is going to hit the consultant
head count where – so the mix of employees versus consultants will probably change a bit, swinging a little bit more
towards employees.
But we're constantly looking for, and it will be in the realm of process reengineering, simplification and globalization
towards reducing head count. It's not our primary goal. Our primary goal is cost. And the heads that are coming out as
this year progresses and as we hit the end of the data center projects, et cetera, really are built into Mike's cost
guidance. So that's – while we haven't given a head count guidance; that was kind of where we were headed for cost.
And to be honest, not all of those are head count, either. That's not really our primary focus. But clearly, as you
simplify systems, that's a natural result.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Right. But I mean I think the message for all you on the call
is, pro forma head count's down 40%. I think that's pretty substantive. I wouldn't be looking for another big leg down.
That's our point; not our focus.

And our next question comes from the line of Johannes Thormann of HSBC. Johannes, you may proceed.
<Q - Johannes Thormann>: Hi, everybody. Just a quick question on the share buyback. Under which conditions
would you start the share buyback again, considering your reduced net debt level, although it's partly FX driven?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer & Group Executive Vice President>: I'll take that, Johannes. I
mean remember that said my remarks is we are operating currently this quarter at sort of our target level of leverage.
We do want to maintain strategic flexibility and a strong balance sheet, so we are – our priorities are first, stay within
that level; second to invest in the business and invest in growth. If the opportunities obviously, meet our desired return
levels.
And then should we determine that we have excess cash flows and cash flow outlook says business is strong, we would
look to dividend and share buyback. So really like – rather not comment further at this stage. We do have a share
buyback authorization outstanding. We haven't been executing on it since the financial crises. And it's something that
we'll continue to be looking at, as we've now de-levered; we're at the levels that we're comfortable with.
<Q - Johannes Thormann>: Okay. Thanks.
