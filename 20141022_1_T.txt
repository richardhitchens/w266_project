So with that overview, I now will turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?
John J. Stephens
Thank you, Mike. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and we always appreciate your interest in AT&T.
Before we report out on our quarterly results, I would like to update you on Project VIP and the longer-term view of
our business transformation. We have been focused on building ultrafast video centric networks and providing mobile
connectivity to any device anywhere our customers need it. I'm pleased to say we have made great progress.
It's been nearly 2 years since we first announced our VIP initiatives and our plans to transition to IP networks.
Basically, we're doing everything we said we were going to do and more. We reached our 4G LTE build target in the
third quarter four months ahead of schedule. The nation's most reliable LTE network now covers more than 300 million
people. We continue to improve our cell site density and add capacity to help keep our network best in class.
We're also on pace with our wireline network goals. Our high-speed IP broadband network now reaches 57 million
customer locations. About two thirds of our U-verse video footprint now has access to 45 Mb per second speeds. We
also continue to make progress on expanding our U-verse video footprint, and we have committed to deploy ultrafast
AT&T GigaPower service in 17 markets. Our fiber-to-the-business expansion also is going strong. We now pass more
than 600,000 new business customer locations with fiber, well on our way to our 1 million goal. The transformation of
our customer base also continued in the quarter.
Two years ago when we first introduced Project VIP, less than half of our broadband customers had high-speed IP
broadband. Now a significant part of that transition is complete with nearly three-quarters of our base on high-speed
U-verse broadband. And our Strategic Business Services are on track to be nearly 30% total Wireline business revenues
by the end of this year.
The transition in Wireless is just as dramatic. There has been a steady shift of our subscribers to usage-based plans.
More than 80% of our Smartphone base is now on usage-based plans. At the same time, Mobile Share Value has helped
move customers off the traditional subsidy model.
We also have launched new business opportunities that will leverage our investment in our high-speed networks. The
connected car is ready to take off. In the third quarter alone, we added more than 500,000 connected cars as the 2015
models start to roll off the assembly lines. Digital Life, the first all-digital, all-IP home security and automation
platform, has launched in 82 markets and has about 140,000 subscribers. And AT&T has completed a
network-on-demand trial in Austin that will enable companies to easily order, add or change services on their own in
near-real time. A commercial rollout of network-on-demand-enabled Ethernet services is expected in Austin by the end
of this year.
Our financial strength allows us to invest while still returning substantial value to shareholders. In fact, since 2012, we
have returned more than $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Cash flows are strong, and
we have been aggressive in monetizing non-strategic assets. Including the sale of our Connecticut Wireline property,
we have generated about $16 billion in cash proceeds from asset sales. This has helped us average nearly $20 billion a
year in free cash flow and asset sales over the last two years, and we expect to do the same this year, 2014.
At the same time, we've kept our financial house in order by funding our pension plan, making significant working
capital improvements, and taking advantage of historically low interest rates. This is the heavy lifting our employees
are doing every day that you don't always notice in the quarterly numbers. We aren't just managing for the short term;
we're managing and investing for the long term.
Now with that view, let's take a look at third quarter results starting with our financial summary on slide four.
Consolidated revenue grew to $33 billion, up $800 million or 2.5% year-over-year. This was driven by continued
Wireless growth as we repositioned our business model, solid Consumer Wireline growth, once again led by U-verse,
and continued growth in Strategic Business Services. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.58. In the quarter, we had

$0.03 of costs associated with merger and integration-related expenses. We also redeemed some debt early in the
quarter to take advantage of low interest rates. Those redemption costs had a $0.02 impact on the quarter.
When you exclude these items, earnings per share were $0.63 compared to an adjusted $0.66 a year earlier. Cash from
operations continued at a strong rate, and we also continue to find ways to monetize assets. Together, that has generated
$32 billion in cash year-to-date, with year-to-date capital spending of $17 billion and about $7 billion paid in dividends
so far this year. With all of that, our cash position remains strong, even as we continue to return substantial value to
shareholders.
Now let's turn to our operational highlights on slide five. The third quarter was another solid step forward in the
transformation of our business. This included strong subscriber metrics in both Wireless and Wireline, and continued
growth in Strategic Business Services.
In Wireless, we saw good, in fact, great trends in a challenging environment, including more than 2 million net adds.
That included adding twice as many postpaid subscribers as we did in the year-ago third quarter, record low third
quarter postpaid churn, solid wireless revenue growth, and improving adjusted service margins, even with record third
quarter Smartphone gross adds and upgrades. We also saw the continued transition of our customer base to AT&T Next
and Mobile Share Value plans while also realizing sequential ARPU phone growth.
In Wireline, U-verse hit some important subscriber milestones. We now have more than 12 million high-speed
broadband subscribers. The transition phase of moving our broadband base to IP is nearing completion, with about 75%
of our total broadband base on our higher-speed service. And we also reached more than 6 million U-verse video subs.
That helped drive strong U-verse revenue growth and continued Wireline consumer gains. U-verse is now a $15 billion
annualized revenue stream, growing at nearly 24%. In Wireline business, strategic services growth continued at a
strong pace. It's now a $10 billion annualized revenue stream, growing at more than 14%.
With those highlights, let's now drill down, and take a look at our operating results starting with wireless. We had a
great net add quarter. That's the trend we've been seeing throughout the year. Overall, we added more than 2 million
total subscribers, led by postpaid and connected devices. We added nearly 800,000 new postpaid subscribers, that's
twice as many as the year ago quarter. About 450,000 of those were tablets and computing devices, with the remaining
net adds phones, and some Digital Life and year to date, we have added more than 2.4 million postpaid subscribers,
which also doubled last year's pace.
Another key point with our postpaid net adds, is that we are adding these customers while maintaining high credit
standards. These are rock-solid, high-quality new subscribers. These net adds exclude any migrations from our prepaid
segment.
Connected devices also had a strong quarter as we started to see significant impact of the connected car. Nearly 1.3
million connected devices were added in the quarter, including more than half a million cars.
Churn turned in another strong quarter. In fact, it was our best ever third quarter postpaid churn. That follows our best
ever churn in the second quarter. And churn for Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next customers is even lower. Total
churn for the quarter was up slightly to 1.36%, reflecting a larger prepaid base with the March acquisition of Cricket.
These are solid results in a challenging environment.
We saw competitive intensity pick up in an iPhone launch quarter with all major carriers now offering the iPhone. And
we expect that to continue as we move into the holiday sales period in the fourth quarter. But we believe strongly in the
quality of our network, our award-winning customer service, and the value proposition we offer customers. Our results
so far this year show we are on the right track, and we're looking to finish the year strong. Now let's look at revenue
and ARPU on slide seven.
We continue to see a shift in Wireless revenues as customers sign up for Mobile Share Value plans and away from the
traditional subsidy model. Total Wireless revenues for the quarter were up nearly 5%. Service revenues were stable
year-over-year. And equipment revenues were up more than 40%. The take rate for AT&T Next was about the same as
last quarter, about half of gross adds and upgrades. We also saw an increasing number of subscribers bringing their

own device to our network. About 460,000, or 7% of smartphone gross adds, were bring your own device, or BYOD.
That's more than four times what we saw in the year ago third quarter and more than 1 million BYOD customers year
to date.
We continue to have a large base of customers on discounted Mobile Share Value plans who have yet to migrate to
Next. About 20% of our smartphone base is on Next, but about 52% of smartphone subscribers are on the non-subsidy
pricing. This means that there are about 20 million potential Next customers we expect to upgrade. That's up from 17
million at the end of the second quarter.
Next take rates continue to be strong in company-owned stores, nearly all or more than 90% of our Mobile Share Value
customers with pre-Next pricing are choosing AT&T Next when they upgrade in company-owned stores. It all comes
down to customer choice. Customers can choose the plan that is best for them, and that's great for us. And right now,
most customers are choosing to go off the subsidy model when they upgrade or add a new line. Also in the quarter, we
continued to see customers buy up to larger data plans, and more are interested in device insurance. This is helping
drive revenue.
Now let's look at postpaid ARPUs. The expected trends we talked about last quarter are happening as more customers
take AT&T Next. Phone-only service ARPU is down year-over-year but up sequentially. When you add in Next
billings, you get a better view of what an average customer pays us each month. Phone-only ARPU with Next billings
improved sequentially by 2%. The average monthly Next billings were about $29 per month, driving our ARPU with
Next higher. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. We also continue to see strong growth in data
billings. Those details are on slide eight.
Wireless data billings increased by nearly 24% in the quarter. This was due to the increasing number of devices on the
network and customers choosing 10-gigabit plans or larger. More than half of all Mobile Share accounts are on these
plans. During the quarter, we added more than 2 million Mobile Share accounts, giving us 16.7 million in total. That's
three times as many as we had a year ago. And we averaged about three connections per Mobile Share account or
nearly 47 million connections in total. That's roughly 60% of our overall postpaid base.
Smartphone sales continue to be strong. In fact, we had 6.8 million smartphone gross adds and upgrades. That's a
third-quarter record, and it would have been even higher without inventory constraints. We added 1.2 million
subscribers to our smartphone base, including about 500,000 smartphone net adds. Most of our sales continue to be
smartphones, about 91% of the flow share. About two-thirds of our postpaid smartphone base use LTE phones. As you
know, LTE devices provide the best customer experience while also being the most efficient on our networks.
Let's now look at our Wireline results, starting with Consumer on slide nine. U-verse hit two subscriber milestones in
the quarter. First, we now have more than 12 million high-speed broadband subscribers after adding more than 600,000
in the quarter. U-verse broadband is now 73% of our total broadband base and 75% in the Consumer broadband base.
That's up 70% in the last two years. That's helped drive total postpaid – excuse me. That helped drive total positive
broadband net adds in the quarter.
We also continue to deploy our ultra high-speed GigaPower service. We now offer one-gigabit speeds in Austin and
have turned up the service in Dallas and Fort Worth. We've also committed to deploy GigaPower in 14 additional
markets including Houston, Miami and Atlanta. We also passed the 6 million mark with U-verse TV subscribers,
adding 216,000 in the quarter. And bundles continue to play a big role in our growth. More than 97%, or virtually all of
our video customers, have some kind of bundle with us, most often broadband and video, and nearly two-thirds of our
U-verse TV subscribers take three or four services with us.
ARPU for U-verse triple play customers continues to be more than $170. That helps drive revenue growth while
reducing churn. In fact, triple play-bundled customers have significantly lower churn than standalone customers. All
this helped drive 3% revenue growth in Consumer. Total U-verse revenues are now more than a $15 billion annualized
revenue stream and are continuing to grow at nearly 24% year-over-year. U-verse now represents 64% or nearly
two-thirds of our consumer revenues. That compares to 54% just a year ago.

Now let me take you to our Wireline business results on slide 10. We also reached another significant milestone in the
Wireline business. Strategic business services, those are our growth services such as VPN, Ethernet, hosting and other
advanced IP services, are nearly a $10 billion annualized revenue stream for us now.
These services make up more than 28% of business wireline revenue and grew by more than 14% in the third quarter.
At our current growth rate, strategic business services should be about 30% of business wireline revenues by the end of
the year. Overall business revenues declined by 2% in the quarter, service revenues were also down 2% year-over-year.
The shift to IP data and away from legacy services, as well as the economy is the story in the wireline business.
But within the business, there are some differences. Our retail service revenues actually grew year-over-year. Those are
service revenues from enterprise and small business. Enterprise revenues were up 1.7%. That's its best performance in
years, and the sixth consecutive quarter of service revenue growth. Small business trends also improved. That's even
with the lack of new business formations.
On the other hand, wholesale is again challenged by network grooming issues. We also made a strategic decision to
refocus the wholesale business. That reduced wholesale revenues about $50 million in the quarter, and we expect that
amount to increase in the fourth quarter, and thereafter. The positive trends in retail service revenues are encouraging,
as is the transition to IP services from legacy products. But the economy and fewer business starts continue to make for
a challenging environment and clearly call for the government to move towards tax reform legislation.
Now let's look at consolidated and wireline margins on slide 11. For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated margin was
17.2% compared to 18.5% in the year ago quarter. Wireless margins were pressured by strong adoption of Mobile
Share Value plans, solid customer growth, promotional activities, and the Leap acquisition. However, when compared
to the year ago third quarter, adjusted wireless EBITDA service margins actually expanded to 43.1%. That's a solid
performance given our very strong postpaid and smartphone net adds, as well as record third quarter gross adds and
upgrades.
Wireline margins were pressured by increasing content costs and transformation expenses. Lower legacy revenues also
contributed to the pressure. But this pressure was partially offset by growth in consumer revenues, gains in strategic
business services, and solid execution on cost initiatives.
Now let's move to cash flow. Our summary is on slide 12. In the first nine months of the year, cash from operations
totaled $25.6 billion and $8.7 billion for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $17 billion and $5.2 billion for the
quarter, and free cash flow before dividends is $8.6 billion and $3.5 billion for the quarter. We did monetize about $500
million of Next receivables in the quarter as there continues to be great interest from financial institutions, and
additional tranches in the future are possible. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.7, and our credit rating continues to
be among the best in the industry.
In terms of uses of cash, dividend payments year to date totaled $7.2 billion, and we continue to be opportunistic with
our share buyback program. Our asset sales strengthened our balance sheet and cash position. When you include the
$1.9 billion in short-term investments, we had $4.3 billion of cash at the end of the third quarter. We also expect to
close the sale of our Wireline assets in Connecticut with Frontier this Friday, which will enhance our cash position with
$2 billion in proceeds.
Let me close with a quick summary of the quarter on slide 13. We continue to make progress with our business
transformation in this quarter and throughout this year. That includes the repositioning of our postpaid base off the
subsidy model. Mobile Share accounts continue to grow, and about 57% of our gross adds and upgrades in the quarter
were either AT&T Next or BYOD. At the same time, we continue to see strong total and postpaid net adds with low
postpaid churn in a very challenging environment.
We also continue to rationalize our business portfolio. This includes completing the sale of the America Movil equity
interest, closing Connecticut Wireline property transaction two months earlier than we had expected, and exiting select
low-margin Wireline wholesale businesses. This rationalization, as well as the impact of more BYOD devices than we
had expected, and fewer net AT&T net gross adds and upgrades, will impact revenues. The company now expects
full-year consolidated revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range.

Even with this change, we expect that Next rates will increase for the rest of the year, and continued strong BYOD will
help with margins even with traditional fourth quarter holiday pressure. So overall, we continue to have confidence in
our strategy and our ability to compete in this challenging environment.
With that, Tony, let's go ahead and take some questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. John, you made a lot of protective moves this year obviously, and
we're seeing phone-only ARPU stabilizing, but EBITDA has gone ex-growth. I guess just trying to think into 4Q, I'm
assuming that the expectation clearly without subsidies will see a decent number in year-over-year growth in EBITDA.
And then just as part of that, if you could identify what you're seeing out there with respect to recent data points on the
iPhone with respect to sticker shock, and this whole issue of people being concerned about layering EIP payments on
top of the existing plan. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Mike. I appreciate your question. First of all, on the sticker shock issue itself, quite
frankly, with 90%-plus of the people coming into our stores, we're not seeing – I won't say we haven't seen one or two,
but we're not seeing any strong number at all of sticker shock. And the reality of it is, is for a person to come in and go
to a subsidized model, they've got to come up with $240 plus whatever taxes they have to pay. And if they stay on the
Next model, they not only get the cheaper service on a monthly basis, but the up-front costs are really only about $50.
So from a sticker shock, it's much more positive to go on Next than it is to come up with a down payment for the
subsidized phone. So we – and we really aren't seeing that at all.
On the expectations for the fourth quarter, I won't go into details but as we said before, we expect a significant
improvement in margins, EBITDA Service margins in the fourth quarter compared to prior years, and we are still
working towards achieving what we've said in the past, and that is all four quarters this year to be 40% EBITDA
Service margins or better.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Okay. Thanks, John.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Hey, John.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Hey. So my question is on the improvement on the ARPU side. Can you – John, could you
just talk a little bit about what the drivers are of the sequential improvement we saw in phone ARPU and the
improvement we saw in the postpaid ARPU? And then, as it relates to the pre-Next program, it looks like you went
from 17 to 20 in the quarter, it's a real slowdown. Have you guys repositioned the basis as much as you think is
necessary, or are we going to see that reaccelerate in the fourth quarter? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Great. So on the ARPU story, I think the biggest issue with the improvement is really the
people buying the bigger buckets and buying up in plans. And as we've mentioned, we had over 50% of the customer
base at the 10-gig or bigger plans, and we believe that that is really helping on the ARPU side. We still have – we still

expect more customers to migrate to the Mobile Share Value plans, so we may still see some more pressure from
existing customers on that ARPU side, but the buying the bigger buckets is definitely helping.
Secondly, on the Next take rate, the two – uniqueness of this quarter, two items that are unique to this quarter were,
one, the significant BYOD. And while those 400,000-plus BYOD devices really don't bring us much if anything in
revenue, and caused an adjustment in our thoughts on revenue, they don't bring any expense, either, and so we'll take
those every time we can get them. That seemed to have an impact on the Next take rate.
The other issue is where inventory was available in the launch month, which was September, where customers have a
much higher experience, better experience going to Next in our company-owned stores, but in the launch cycle
sometimes inventory was constrained. So people would go into different locations where our experience level in Next
hasn't been as high, particularly in some of the new channels, like some of the big box stores or some the manufacturer
stores. So we had expected that to get to those higher levels over time, so we do expect the rate to increase. It's just
going to take a little longer time than we had expected.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Got it. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Thanks for taking the question. John, I just wanted to clarify, the postpaid net add
estimate did not include internal migrations from prepaid. And then to what extent did you see prepaid migrations to
postpaid maybe coming from your peers, and have you made any changes to your credit standards?
<A - John J. Stephens>: So a couple of things, Joe. So we haven't made any changes to our credit standards in any
way, shape, or form that would be significant or would change any traffic. Secondly, we do not count any migrations
from, for example, our Cricket product into our AT&T product. Those would be excluded not only for phones but for
tablets. That's not how we count or have ever counted that information.
I can't comment necessarily, give you a lot of significant information with regard to any change in the migration from
the customers that are porting into us, whether they were previously prepaid or postpaid customers of the other carriers.
What I mean to say by that is, I don't want to indicate that there's any significant change in that. I am not aware of that.
So I will leave it at that.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Got it. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks a lot. Good evening. John, are you still committed to the $21 billion capital spending
guidance that would imply just a $4 billion number for the fourth quarter? And how are we thinking about that? Or is
$21 billion still a good number for 2015 under VIP? And then on wireline margins, you talked about some of the
content cost, some of the transformation costs. When do we see those margins start to stabilize? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Great. Simon, we're still committed to the $21 billion range for 2014, which is the guidance
we've been giving. So that gives us some room and possibly $21.5 billion down to $20.4 billion, somewhere in that's
what I would suggest as a range. But yes, we're still committed to that. Yes, we expect that to be a further step down in
capital spending in the fourth quarter; that was planned.

If people were wondering how that might be accomplished, I will tell you that if you look at what the network team has
accomplished with regard to getting 300 million pops with LTE coverage, getting 600 million business locations passed
with fiber, getting 57 million customers locations passed with IP broadband capabilities, we are ahead of the game, so
to speak, in what we laid out. And so there's a real opportunity to manage capital that way and still continue to meet our
targets. It's a benefit of being ahead of the game on some of the build.
With regard to 2015, I won't give any additional guidance. I will specifically give any additional guidance, we'll give
that in January and update our guidance like we normally do. I will suggest to you this though: we still expect tax
extenders to get passed in the post-election sessions of Congress and those to get signed. If that doesn't get signed, I
would suggest to you that companies, all companies will have to take into account that change in their ability to invest,
because it's a financial change in their balance sheet and their cash flow statements. And that would be – for us it would
definitely be taken into account in what we decide on our investments next year.
But quite frankly, I think many companies, it would have an immediate impact if it's not passed on their March or their
first quarter tax return payments for this year, and that might have a more immediate impact on capital spending by
other parties. My point here is that I think tax reform, specifically tax extenders, needs to be completed.
With regard to Wireless margins, two pieces to that story. There certainly is the content piece, and we've got a strategic
resolution or opportunity to make improvements on that. But secondly on our transformation piece, as you heard in our
presentation, 75% of our DSL customers have converted to high-speed broadband products, and we've converted a
significant number of feature phones to smartphones, all of this conversion going on.
In the Wireline space, that conversion's had a lot of cost. Those costs are getting behind us now. When you have 75%
of the base on high-speed, you've incurred those costs, so that gives us an opportunity to improve margins going
forward.
I will tell you there's a second transformation going on, and that's how we serve our customers, how we take orders,
how we provision and how we validate those orders, how we provision them, how we activate service. We are actively
working on mechanizing that ordering process, mechanizing that validation, that provisioning-planning process. Those
– that work is not yet completed. We've made a lot of great traction, but that work will certainly continue on into next
year and once we have that complete, those two pieces of our transition costs will be behind us, and that will give us
the opportunity to really grow margins. That's what we're looking forward to.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you, Simon.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Yeah, thanks a lot. Just a follow up here. You talk about an expectation that your Next
take rate is likely to increase into the fourth quarter after kind of stabilizing in 3Q. I just want to clarify, is that because
you are putting more emphasis on that channel, or are you seeing something else that's driving it? And then just in
terms of other sort of margin drivers into the fourth quarter, can you give us some thoughts on where you think we're
going to see the upgrade rate come out?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, so, Brett, let me give you the simplest answer I can with regard to the Next rate
improving. Our stores in September had some shortages on inventory where customers went and – our customers went
and bought inventory from other channels. Our stores, our company-owned stores, have the highest performance of
Next take rate. So now that those inventory constraints, we're expecting to get behind us, we're not quite there yet but
we expect them to get behind us, we'll get back to more normal sharing of that. That's the first reason.
Second reason is, as we rolled out the Next program in our – the manufacturer stores and in the -the national retailer
stores, there's a learning curve, and we are going through that. And as we go through the learning curve, the Next take

rate for those operations has been improving. Those are the two reasons why we think that the overall take rate can
improve. Any time you have a launch of a new device in a month it challenges a lot of pieces of your operations. In this
case, it challenged our Next take rates.
With regard to margin activities, we're going to have all the – we continue to have the focus on expense management
and expense reduction across the enterprise, but I think you probably know that. With regard to percentages on upgrade
rates, we're not going to give any guidance on that, and I wouldn't suggest there would be any differences one way or
the other than you'd have in a fourth quarter holiday season with a new product launch out there.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Great. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess a couple of housekeeping things. One, can you reiterate or not the
$11 billion in free cash flow and your EPS guidance that you've given earlier in the year? And then second, just
following up on Brett's question on the Next mix, given the – I want to think is a tougher credit requirement and the
limits on distribution, how big of a mix on gross adds could this be, do you think? Is there sort of an upper limit around
75 or 80 that this doesn't go above? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So, Phil, let me say this. We're not changing guidance with regard to EPS or free cash flow.
We're still in the $11 billion range. We're still – I think what I said before is the low end of the mid-single digit EPS
range. The only caveat I'll give to that is if we continue to have quarters where we can add 2 million customers, we're
not going to turn down the opportunity of 2 million postpaid customers or the kind of wireline growth we have had in
our strategic services. We are not going to turn that down just to make a goal that the finance guys may have set. We're
going to do what's right for the business, but sticking by what we said before.
With regard to the Next take rates, I think you hit on the right point in the sense of there is always going to be a credit
scoring impact on the availability or the qualification of all customers, so there will always be some customers who
would be better suited for one of our other arrangements, or one of our other products. We welcome them, we love to
have them. But we're not likely to go with the Next program for them.
Secondly, and I think as importantly, is customers just want to have choice, and so we will look to make sure that they
have a choice. If they don't want to use the Next program, that's fine, we'll have another opportunity for them.
With that being said, we certainly expect that with this Mobile Share Value pricing going to two thirds of our base by
the end of the year that there is a significant step up in the number of Next customers compared to what we have today.
Whether that all occurs in the fourth quarter or some of it occurs in 2015, we'll have to wait and see, but either way, it's
still a good, long-term investment for us, and we believe a good long-term situation for our customers.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Great. Thank you for taking the question. John, I just wanted to explore the SMB. You
realized some significant bucking of what I would think would be a different trend, just because all our checks show
that the cable guys have been nothing short of aggressive. Can you talk a little bit of what you're seeing, or what you're

doing differently there, or is it just macro? Are you leading on wireless, etc.?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Kind of all of the above, Jennifer. I'm glad to take the call. A couple of things. One, we're
putting a lot of fiber out there, and our fiber, when you think about U-verse fiber and that U-verse fiber what many
people think is consumer, also can be available for business, but also the fiber that is passing those business locations.
We're finding that that fiber is enabling us to really go in and not only reinforce our customer position with existing
customers, but be very competitive in offering services to new customers.
Secondly, our strategic services piece in the small business is growing healthily. It's not a big base as of today, but it is
growing well. And the customers seem to like those services and are willing to take them. So the investments we have
made in VIP are starting to pay off.
But lastly, you hit the nail on the head, and this is what we've done on an organizational perspective. It works for small
business as well as large business. But the ability to be agnostic with regard to the services of whether it's wired or
wireless, or more importantly, the ability to combine wired and wireless services for your customers through one
organization has proven to be really powerful, even in small business.
And so that's how we think we're bucking the trend of no business starts, but we've got a long way to go, and we need
to keep the teams performing well. We need to keep it up and keep it moving forward. We're not making any
declarations now, but we do have a better feel for the situation than we did a few quarters ago.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey. Thanks, guys. Appreciate letting me ask some questions. So the first question would be
on the enterprise side. Your biggest competitor talked about what sounded like were some structural things going on in
the industry on private line pricing, core connectivity pricing, and it doesn't seem to of been an issue for you guys in the
quarter. I was wondering if you guys could kind of give a sense as to your comfort level on the enterprise positive
trajectory?
And then the second was obviously the payoff from the forward pricing initiative has been the lower churn that you've
been posting up. Are you comfortable letting people look at kind of a 10 to 15 basis point year-over-year churn
improvement be the new run rate baseline expectation on a go forward basis? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, David. A couple of things. One, I've got to tell you, the performance in enterprise
has to do with our people, has to do with our enterprise sales team both on the Wired and the Wireless side, and the
performance our network provides our largest customers. I had the opportunity to meet with about 10 of our largest
customers a few weeks ago in New York, and I can tell you that they are satisfied with the kind of service, the quality,
the security offerings, those strategic services. So we are hard at work to continue the good progress we've made, and
not lose sight of it. It is a tough environment, but we're working very hard to continue it. Our advantage is our Wired
network and capabilities, as well as the ability to combine it with Wireless.
On the payoff in lower churn, we've certainly seen net payoff in lower churn. We're not ready to establish a standard for
that. We need to get through a full year of this process before we even start formulating those numbers. But if you will,
two quarters in a row of best-ever churn and year-to-date, best-ever churn, and those churn numbers on the postpaid
side all below – all in the two-digit range, is very encouraging, but we're going to be careful to continue to work hard
and move this company forward. It's a long process of transformation that we're going through and we're nearing
completion, but we want to make sure we finish it very strong. So I'll leave off any predictions on rates.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Okay. Thanks, John.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much, and good afternoon, folks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Hi, Amir. How are you?
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: I'm doing well, John. Seems to be some interesting buzz among the supplier community
around the supplier 2 – Domain 2.0 initiative. I wanted to see if there was any updates from you folks on this front in
terms of development. And also tying into some of your earlier commentary on CapEx trajectory, in other words, what
you've seen so far, does that solidify some of your thoughts on the ability to drive down CapEx intensity in terms of
your expenditures in some of the out years, John?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Continue to be optimistic on our software-directed networks, so our network-on-demand trial
in Austin, just this last few months, has proved positive. We're excited about the opportunity to get a launch in Austin
of a product on an Ethernet basis that is what we call network-on-demand, so those things are real. They take time to
implement and to do right, and the guys – and the team is striving to do it right, but we remain optimistic.
With regard to the software-directed networks and the ability to use that to manage and harness in our capital costs,
continue to remain positive. We take that into account in our spending projections and our estimates.
I would suggest to you though, it is a – not a short road but a long road when you have a company that has $100 billion
of net property plant and equipment that you're managing, and networks that have a significant history to them, it's
going to take some time. But we remain positive and optimistic, and yes, we are receiving savings or achieving value
from those software-directed networks, and we hope to increase those amounts over time.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Great. Thank you very much for the additional color.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, two quick ones if I may. So the
bring-your-own-device trends seem very positive. I'm just wondering, how do you deal with bring-your-own-device
customers coming over from CDMA? Do you give them a new handset, or are all those coming just from T-Mobile?
And then secondly, I didn't quite understand your comment on the impact of bring-your-own-device customers on the
Next take rate. I would have assumed all of those customers would take Next or take the Next pricing that would be
what would be most attractive to them. And if that's not the case, then I'm not sure why it would have impacted your
revenue growth for the year. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Okay. So quickly speaking on the BYOD device, these devices are coming not only from
competitors who operate similar networks or whose devices will operate on our networks, which get – which may be
more than one competitor whose devices may actually work on our networks, but they also come from devices that
previously went into the drawer and were left at home, and maybe these were handed down either to family or friends,
neighbors, whatever the case may be. People may buy them over eBay and bring them in and have already paid for
them, so they come from a variety of sources. They could be reusing devices that had previously flown through our
networks. That's the first case.
The second case is, if those phones would have been sold by us, we would've had, depending upon what the device
cost, $500 cost, $500 of revenue and $500 of cost. It wouldn't have provided any margin, it wouldn't have provided any
contribution, but it would have provided revenue.

So we still are getting our customer adds, and we're getting efficiency with the reuse of the devices, we're just not
getting any revenue out of them. And that is quite frankly, a big piece when we're talking about over one million
devices so far, and choose your number on how much revenue we would of gotten out of each of those devices, you can
understand the impact it could have even on a company of our size as revenue. So that is the point there. We would
have assumed that those kind of devices, people would have come in and Next.
Secondly, I would make a distinction here, these BYOD devices are getting the Mobile Share Value plans and
generally speaking, they're getting the lower-priced service, because they are bringing their device. They're just not
getting Next because they don't have to pay for a phone.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Got it. Okay. Thanks, John. I appreciate it.
<A - John J. Stephens>: No problem. Thank you.
<A - Michael Viola>: Hey, Tony, this will be our last question.
Operator
Okay. Thank you, sir. And that will be from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. First, as we think about your move to
consumption base pricing and we also think about some of the changes in the sizes of the buckets for data, can you give
us a sense of what's happening as you increase the data buckets, you try to encourage customers to spend more on data?
Are you getting more in data revenue relative to those that might have started at a higher plan and can use the same
amount but move to a cheaper bucket?
And then the second question is, if you just had an update on the regulatory process with the DIRECTV deal, I think
the FCC put out an update on their clock today, and I was just curious if you could talk about the implications of that,
and any updates from your perspective? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure. On the data buckets, I would refer you back to the slide that we showed with regard to
data billings, and that they were up about, I believe, 24% year-over-year. So what we're seeing in this opportunity is
this: people are buying up, particularly with the Mobile Share Value plan they're required to get the 10-meg bucket – or
10-gig bucket, excuse me, but they're buying up anyway. And then it does have some impact in some cases on overage
rates and so forth, but quite frankly, a better customer experience comes out of having these bigger buckets also.
Additionally, and probably as important as anything, when they buy those bigger buckets, they're adding things.
They're going to add tablets. They're going to add wearables. They're going add other devices. Soon they'll be adding
connected cars. And so, they add other family phones or other members of the family tablets.
So what you see is they buy up these buckets, and then they start using them and getting more functionality, and then
they are more tied to us. If you look at our Mobile Share Value accounts, I think we have about 16.5 million, almost 17
million, and we have about 47 million or 48 million devices or connections on them. So these bigger buckets, that's
what is happening, it's helping us get pretty sticky with our customers, and that's how we feel. The data billings
increase of almost – of over 20% is clearly what we would point to you to say, what's going on with the data side.
With regard to the DIRECTV, the FCC didn't make a decision today to stop the clock. That decision has nothing to do
with the merits of our deal, or any of the information that we have provided. The FCC's order made it clear that there
was concern about the confidentiality of the information that some content companies provide the FCC, and they're
trying to deal with those issues. We're confident in the FCC's rigorous procedures for keeping the information
confidential, and we are ready to provide them with the information they have requested from us. While the FCC
stopping the clock on merger reviews is fairly common, today's decision doesn't change our view that we will be able to
get the deal approved and closed by the first half – in the first half of 2015. So my guess is – that's the color I would
give you around that.

We're still optimistic about the transaction. The stopping of the clock is not an uncommon or rare experience, and it has
something to do with other issues than the benefits of our deal or the merits of our deal. So we'll continue to support the
process and look forward to getting the transaction closed within that originally announced one-year kind of timeframe.

John J. Stephens
Before we close, I want to thank all of you for being with us this afternoon. As you can tell, we continue to make
significant progress in transforming our business not only in the third quarter, but all year long. That not only includes
repositioning our postpaid base off the subsidy model, but we also did that while having strong net adds, strong
postpaid gains, and record levels of churn. We also had a strong performance in Wireline with continued strong
performance in U-verse and Strategic Business Services, and our ability to combine our Wired and Wireless services
for our customers' benefit. We look to continue that solid momentum into the fourth quarter and finish the year strong.
Once again, thank you for being on the call. As always, we thank you for your interest in AT&T. And have a great
evening. Take care.
