The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, and as such, are subject to the risks and
uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form
10-K and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.
All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated.
I'll now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.
John T. Chambers
Thanks, Mel.
In Q1 FY 2014, Cisco delivered record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53 per share and revenue growth of 2%
year over year. This level of revenue growth in Q1, while not inconsistent with some of our large peers, was below our
expectations for the quarter.
Over the last few quarters I've shared with you what I've been seeing, a macro environment that is inconsistent and very
hard to read, with business leaders' confidence slowing purchase decisions. The last month of our quarter was during
the U.S. government shutdown. The impact on our federal business was approximately $50 million. Our team there did
an exceptionally good job managing through this challenging period. However, the shutdown, debt ceiling negotiations,
and delay of key decisions exacerbated the lack of confidence among business leaders we had highlighted over the past
few quarters.
As we walk through our business in detail, you will hear many positives. Our strategy to solve our customers' biggest
technology and biggest business challenges is working. We delivered strong non-GAAP profitability. We're leading
most of the major transitions in the market, and our innovation engine is firing extremely well. That said, we are
managing through several cycles in our business: first, emerging market weakness; second, the introduction of several
new generation platforms and high-end switching and routing; and third, our service provider business evolution.
Our intermediate and long-term strategic view has not changed, and we are continuing to lean forward and make
investments that will drive our future growth. We are disrupting markets. Look at our Application Centric
Infrastructure launch, Internet of Things World Forum, and our NCS [Network Convergence System] launch in just the
last month to drive value to our customers and to our shareholders.
From where I sit, I believe we are well positioned at the center of the long-term transitions shaping the communications
and IT markets. We feel the momentum our thought leadership in this market, and we are experiencing our customers'
confidence in Cisco expand as we move to become their trusted business partner and hopefully the number one IT
partner. I know many of you speak with our customers and partners, and I'd be very surprised if you're not seeing and
hearing the same thing.
For Q1, I want to highlight five key takeaways. First, once again our financials are very strong. In Q1 we delivered
record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53, non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3%, and strong non-GAAP gross
margins of 63%. We generated operating cash flow of $2.6 billion and returned approximately $3 billion to our
shareholders through the buyback and dividend. The one obvious exception is our revenue growth.
Second, our strategy is solid and we are leading on the critical transitions in the market. I look at cloud as one example.
We are the leading cloud infrastructure provider as measured by Synergy Research. And our Cloud Services business,
including WebEx, hosted collaboration, elements of our own security and wireless portfolio are showing good
momentum. And last week, we demonstrated how we expect to lead the SDN market by delivering an integrated
system that drives to the core of solving our customers' top challenges, speed of application delivery, virtualization,
OpEx and CapEx reductions, simplicity, security, and scale in a single architecture. In every case, our ability to pull
together the breadth of our portfolio to deliver architectures and solutions to meet customer outcomes sets us apart.

Third, our innovation engine is executing extremely well. We continue to innovate through our build, buy, partner
strategy and are seeing the benefits. In the last quarter, we introduced game changing core routing and core switching
platforms and took a significant step forward in our security business with the acquisition of Sourcefire. With these and
other moves, we are uniquely positioned to help our customers navigate the demands of the cloud, mobility, the
application economy, and the Internet of Everything. These platforms are expected to ramp over several quarters.
But perhaps one of the things that I'm most pleased at, and is this different than we've ever done before on our new
product development, high-end switching, and high-end routing, each of these new products, for example, the Nexus
9000 with ACI, CRS-X, and NCS are in line with our current margins from day one, just a really nice job by
engineering.
Fourth, we are managing through some economic technology and product cycles. From a macroeconomic perspective,
in the last two quarters our order growth rate in emerging countries, which is over 20% of our product business, has
gone from a positive 13% in total in Q3 to a negative 12% in Q1 of this year. You can do the math, but that's a drag of
between four to five percentage points on our growth for this quarter. In service provider, we are managing through
product cycles across our portfolio, including high-end core, edge, and SP video. What you know about Cisco is that
when we have a focus on something, we address it, and I see this as no different.
Fifth, we have a unique opportunity to be our customers' number one IT company. Our customers are asking us to step
up in new ways, to take a broader role in helping them achieve their business outcomes. At our recent CIO meeting
with 95 of top global CIOs, they confirmed our leadership position and increased opportunity for Cisco over the next
years in their own individual companies. And this was at a much higher level than the other top IT players that we
talked about with these CIOs. This is a tremendous validation and is pushing us to move faster to offer our portfolio of
technology and architectures as solutions to address the business outcomes our customers need. Fortunately for Cisco,
no one comes close in being able to meet their requirements, and we are moving with speed to evolve to capitalize on
this opportunity.
To provide additional detail on our Q1 FY 2014 results, I'd like to turn it over to Frank. After Frank, I'll then walk
through some additional detail on what we're seeing in the business. Frank will then detail our guidance, and we'll wrap
the call up with Q&As; Frank, to you.
Frank A. Calderoni
Thank you, John.
In Q1 FY 2014, we drove solid profitability despite our lower than expected revenue growth. Our business continues to
operate in an inconsistent and mixed macroeconomic environment, and we had specific challenges in emerging markets
and service provider. At the same time, we had relative strength in data center, wireless, security, and our switching
businesses. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $12.1 billion, growing 2% year over year. And non-GAAP
EPS was $0.53, growing 10% year to year.
In this quarter, we continued to execute consistently with our portfolio approach to acquisitions aligned to driving
long-term returns. We announced the WHIPTAIL acquisition to accelerate our UCS strategy. WHIPTAIL is the market
leader in high-performance scalable solid-state memory systems. And we also closed two acquisitions this quarter,
Composite Software and Sourcefire. Sourcefire, a leader in intelligent cyber security solutions, brings industry-leading
products, talent, and an open source approach to our security portfolio. Composite Software offers data virtualization
software and services and will extend our next-generation services offerings. We also announced our intent to acquire
the remaining interest in Insieme Networks as part of our Application Centric Infrastructure-based data center and
cloud solutions.
Total product [revenue] from a geographic perspective grew 4% for the Americas, 3% for EMEA, and decreased 9%
for APJC. The overall product revenue increased 1%, and total services revenue increased 4%. We delivered solid
non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3%, with consistent results in both gross margins and operating expenses with

continued strong discipline in these areas.
In Q1, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.0%. That compares to 62.7% a year ago and 62.1% last quarter. We
continued to see good stability over multiple quarters in product gross margins, with non-GAAP product gross margins
at 62.0% compared with 61.5% a year ago and 60.8% last quarter. Our non-GAAP services gross margin was 66.6%
compared to 67.1% last quarter and 66.9% in Q1 FY 2013. Total gross margin by geography for Americas was 63.6%.
In EMEA it was 64.4%. In APJC it was at 58.8%.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.1 billion or 33.7% as a percentage of revenue, and this compares to 34.8%
in Q1 of FY 2013.
Our head count grew less than 100 from the end of the fiscal year to 75,136. This reflects the addition of over 850
employees from the Sourcefire and Composite Software acquisitions, offset by our workforce rebalancing that we
announced in our Q4 FY 2013 earnings call. As I mentioned on that call, the workforce reduction plan provides us the
ability to invest in key growth areas such as cloud, data center, mobility, services, software, and security to effectively
manage our business for the long term.
Other income and expenses were $85 million, reflecting a benefit of higher investment gains during the quarter.
Now moving on to our non-GAAP tax provision rate, it was 21% and it was consistent with our expectations.
Our non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, representing an increase of 12%. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP
net income was 23.7%. As I mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.53
versus $0.48 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, and again this represents a 10% increase.
Our GAAP net income was $2.0 billion, and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.37. GAAP net
income included $257 million of pre-tax charge related to our intended acquisition of Insieme Networks, as I
previously mentioned.
As we indicated in our Q4 FY 2013 call, as part of our workforce reduction plan, we stated that we expected to take
pre-tax charges to our GAAP financial results in an amount not to exceed $550 million. During Q1, we recognized
pre-tax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $237 million related to that announcement.
Our cash returns to shareholders, balance sheet, and cash flows were once again areas of strength. During the quarter
we returned $2.9 billion to our shareholders, including $2 billion through the share repurchase and $914 million
through our quarterly dividend. Our diluted share count decreased slightly as a result of the timing of our share
repurchases. The remaining impact of the Q1 repurchase will be reflected in the reduced share count next quarter.
As disclosed in our press release today, our board has approved an increase to the repurchase program of $15 billion,
demonstrating our commitment to our capital allocation strategy. The remaining approved amount for share
repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is $16.1 billion.
Total cash, cash equivalents, and the investments were $48.2 billion, including $6.2 billion which was available in the
U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated solid operating cash flow of $2.6 billion, increasing 7%.
In terms of our key balance sheet metrics, DSO or days sales outstanding were 39 days. And finally, our non-GAAP
inventory turns were a strong 12.1.
In conclusion, we are focused on the near-term challenges. At the same time, we are investing in our portfolio of
growth initiatives and driving profitability through operational efficiency. We are committed to our capital allocation
strategy through the support of the dividend as well as the buyback. And our overall objective is to deliver long-term
profitable growth and return for our shareholders.
John, I'll now turn the call back over to you.

Thanks, Frank. I'll now provide some additional detail on the performance in Q1 and trends we are seeing in our
business and in the market. I'll first walk through our product portfolio in terms of year-over-year revenue growth,
followed by discussing geographic and customer segments in terms of year-over-year orders.
First, our Switching business performed well, with growth of 3%. Switching gross margins, including new products,
continue to be very stable. We have introduced next-generation products across most of the entire portfolio, including
the highly anticipated data center switching line in the Nexus family, the Nexus 9000, developed by our recently
acquired spin in Insieme Networks. The Nexus 9000 began shipping in November and will ramp over the coming
quarters.
Wireless delivered another solid quarter, with growth in revenues of 8% and strong gross margins. The conversion to
802.11ac is in the beginning stages, with support now across our product line. Cisco's cloud networking platform,
Meraki, continues to perform very, very well.
NGN routing revenue was down 1% for the quarter. We saw declines in the quarter as we managed the product
transitions in that business. We shipped the new NCS platform to our first customers this quarter and continued to
manage the transition of our CRS platform to the CRS-X. On the edge, the ASR 9000 had another record revenue
quarter, with growth comfortably above 20%. But our edge performance was impacted by declines in our traditional
products. In both the core and the edge, we are focused on migrating programs that will drive upgrades to the new
platforms over the coming quarters. We saw a decline in our ASR 5000 mobility revenues, due primarily to timing of
large orders. SP video revenues of $987 million declined 14% year over year.
As we continue to focus on profitable growth, our set-top box business, which had an annual order rate of over $2.6
billion, declined over 20% as we evolve our business to the cloud and hold to our strategy to walk away from low profit
bills. This obviously has a positive impact on margins, but comes with some revenue pain. Let me be very clear. We
know that video is one of the top priorities of all of our service provider customers, and we are committed to the
business. We are evolving our portfolio and have made leadership changes, which will strengthen our ability to meet
strategic requirements of our customers and maintain the right business profile for Cisco.
Our data center business grew 44%, as customers continued to adopt our Unified Computing Systems. We continue to
see success with solutions such as SAP HANA that incorporates our UCS servers. Converged solutions from NetApp
of FlexPod and EMC VMware for Vblock are now each running at over a $1 billion run rate for their total business.
These solutions are fueling our industry-leading strong data center growth across all segments and regions.
UCS is one of the best examples of our portfolio of an architectural approach delivering differentiated value to our
customers and driving our market success. While most of our competitors in this area sell servers, with UCS we sell an
architectural approach, and in just four years have become the number one in the blade server market. UCS sets the
foundation for our leadership in data center, bringing together compute, networking, and storage. And as you think
about where this is going to go in terms of the next generation of driving IT growth, we believe it is around Application
Centric Infrastructure, which will build on this success and expand our leadership for the next decade as we simply
converge applications, networks, and security at scale.
Overall security revenues grew 8%, with particular strength in network security, up 12%. We closed the Sourcefire
acquisition on October 7 and are already seeing the benefits of the focus and the assets we acquire. Security is our
customers' top priority. And according to them, we may be the only company capable of providing the full architecture
they need to address their security challenges. We are off to a good start, and it's up to us to execute on this
architecture.
Moving on to collaboration, revenue was up 1%. As our strategy and execution continues to evolve, Unified
Communication revenues declined by 3% year over year as we move to a different revenue model in the business,
increasing the amount of business which is reoccurring. Conferencing revenue grew 12% and TelePresence revenue
grew 1%. Finally, services revenue grew 4%. The technical services were up 4% and advanced services up 5%.
Non-GAAP gross margins in services were very solid at 66.6%, down slightly from the 66.9% a year ago.

As we discussed last quarter, service revenues are tied closely to product growth. We were very pleased with gross
margin and the technical services growth given the challenging services market. We do believe there is further
opportunity to improve our advanced services performance as we move from transaction to driving our customers' top
business opportunities and the results they want to get in terms of outcomes.
I will now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and
customer segment growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders for Q1 unless specifically stated
otherwise. In Q1, we saw growth momentum and opportunity in global enterprise and commercial. U.S. enterprise and
commercial were both very strong, growing in the high single digits in terms of year-over-year orders. U.S. public
sector actually grew 12.2%. However, the positive growth trends in orders were more than offset by the two factors
mentioned earlier. Emerging market orders declined 12% and service provider orders declined 13%. As a result, total
product orders declined 4% year over year, with total product book-to-bill of less than one.
We did see the weakness, increased conservatism, and slower decision-making on a global basis accelerate beyond our
expectations through the back end of the quarter. In our leadership reviews in mid-September, we believed our orders
in the quarter would translate to revenue in our guidance range.
To provide a geographic view of orders this quarter, the Americas declined 2%. In the U.S., in addition to the good
enterprise and commercial momentum, we delivered U.S. public sector growth of 2%, led by state, local, and education
up 13%. And U.S. Federal was down 3%. Service provider in the U.S. declined by 10%. The issues in the U.S. were
similar to what we see globally in SP, and I'll expand on this in a discussion of the SP segment.
Moving on to Asia-Pacific, Japan, and China, similar to last quarter, we again experienced the same challenges of many
of our peers. Overall, Asia-Pacific, Japan, and China was down 10%. China continued to decline as we and our peers
work through the challenging political dynamics in that country.
The Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Russia region declined 4%m due primarily to the effects of the emerging
markets, public sector, and SP. Central Europe continued to show positive growth while Southern Europe continues to
be challenging. Europe, while there are positive trends, remains challenging, as seen in the recent ECB interest rate
reductions announced last week. This action should help stimulate their fragile economic recovery over time.
Across every geography, the impact of emerging markets weakness was pronounced and accelerated through the back
end of the quarter. Our top five emerging markets declined 21%, with Brazil down 25%, Mexico down 18%, India
down 18%, China down 18%, and Russia down 30%. Just as we always have, we will continue to focus on emerging
markets, investing through the challenges, and expect to see a return to growth in a few quarters, with all the
appropriate caveats.
Moving on to our segment review, as mentioned earlier, enterprise grew 2% and commercial grew 1%. Public sector
declined 1%. Service providers declined 13%. As a reminder, the service provider business continues to be lumpy and
go in cycles. And our service provider growth rate is negatively impacted by the deliberate actions we are taking to
manage the profitability of our set-top boxes. As we discussed before, with set-top box orders, which are approximately
20% of our total service provider business, product service provider business was also down 20%. That means that the
service provider segment started the quarter down minus 4% to 5%, assuming that decrease in set-top boxes.
Several factors negatively impacted the growth in addition to the set-top box impact. First, we operate globally. The
emerging markets challenge had some impact on SP bookings. Second, we introduced two new platforms, NCS and the
CRS-X in the core, and are seeing slower growth than anticipated as customers would continue to invest in their
existing platforms than adopt these new platforms. As a reminder, NCS, like ACI on the switching side, is an entirely
new architecture requiring additional time and testing and evaluation. And third, we lost some share on the low-end
edge, which we need to win back.
As you would expect, we have focused our leadership on what we can control to reaccelerate service provider growth
despite the challenging macro over the next several quarters. We are focused on pulling together the breadth of our
portfolio and innovation to solve our customers' top business opportunities, just as we have done very effectively in
enterprise over the last 12 to 15 months, and we clearly saw the results in enterprise from doing that.

We are managing the evolution of our portfolio and aggressively moving to meet service provider requirements for
greater virtualization of services across our mobile and wireline platforms. We are applying our resources to the
opportunities for greatest growth.
We are seeing very good customer traction in our new core platforms, with active trials in many SP customers and
moving from trials to production. I believe our global service provider strategy is solid, and we are unique in our ability
to address service provider customer challenges with architectural solutions that deliver the business outcomes. We will
continue to focus on the innovation and execution to drive reacceleration of the business.
Managing through product and market cycles is part of being a leader in the technology industry. We feel very
confident in our ability to work through these cycles over the coming quarters.
I will now turn it over to Frank for guidance; Frank, to you
Frank A. Calderoni
Thanks, John. Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter. Let me remind you again
that our comments include forward-looking statements. And you should review our recent SEC filings that identify
important risk factors, and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the
forward-looking statements and that actual results could be above or below our guidance. The guidance we are
providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.
As we look to Q2 FY 2014, we do not anticipate material improvement in our order growth. This is impacting our
revenue guidance for Q2. Given our orders performance in Q1, our backlog is significantly lower than we anticipated.
As a point of reference, approximately 70% of our product revenue is dependent on new orders each quarter. With that
in mind, we expect total revenue to decline in the range of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis.
For the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP
operating margin in Q2 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected
to be approximately 21% in the second quarter. Our Q2 FY 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range
from $0.45 to $0.47 per share.
Given the guidance for Q2 2014 and the shift in momentum in our business, we thought it would be helpful to provide
investors and share more detail on the full year of the fiscal year. We expect our FY 2014 non-GAAP earnings per
share to range from $1.95 to $2.05. Within this, we suggest you model revenue conservatively. We have a strong
handle on our gross margins, operating expenses, and cash flow, and we believe we can deliver this level of
profitability even in an uncertain growth environment.
We are not changing our long-term financial model. We continually reevaluate our long-term model, as you would
expect, as the market changes. We will update you at our financial analyst conference in December if we see the need
for any adjustments. We remain focused on driving profits faster than revenue.
We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.14 per share in Q2 and $0.45 to
$0.60 for the full year. This range includes an impact of approximately $100 million in Q2 2014 and $550 million for
the full year, as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges related to our workforce reduction plan that we
announced last quarter. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail.
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and
our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring, and tax
or other events which may or may not be significant. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance
during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
I thank you and turn it back over to John.

John T. Chambers
Frank, thank you very much.
There is no doubt that the pace of change that we all feel and see is only accelerating. As I've been saying throughout
this calendar year, things that used to occur in five years are happening in three. Things that used to happen in two to
four quarters are occurring in one quarter. This is the new market reality. Let me be very clear; change has always been
good for Cisco. We use these times to get closer to our customers, transform our business, and drive new opportunities.
I speak with many of you, our shareholders, during the year and appreciate the investment you are making in
understanding our business, including attending our launches and events, as many of you did in New York last week. I
know from those meetings that you understand our strategy and where we can take this company. I also know that
while we see these transitions as opportunities, these transitions can create unwelcome quarter-to-quarter volatility and
can be frustrating for long-term shareholders. As we have always done, we commit to you to be transparent, letting
you, our shareholders, see the challenges and the opportunities as we see them. We remain very confident in our
long-term strategy and are committed to managing the business to ensure we drive the greatest long-term value for our
customers, employees, partners, and shareholders.
What can you expect as we address the opportunities, cycles, and challenges in our business and the market over the
next several quarters? First, I realize many of you spend a lot of time speaking with our customers and channel
partners. As you know, our relationship with customers has never been stronger. We are winning, and they know it.
They have asked us to play a bigger role in partnering with them to drive their business outcomes. We will continue to
move quickly to capitalize on the opportunities they have presented to us.
Second, we will continue to manage the business with focus on discipline. Where we have challenges and cycles, we
will move swiftly and decisively to drive growth and continue leadership.
Third, we will maintain our momentum on Cisco's innovation model of build, buy, and partner. We plan to leverage our
acquisition of Sourcefire to achieve our goal to become the number one security company and drive new product
platforms and architectures, like CRS-X, NCS, and ACI to build multibillion dollar businesses at Cisco.
Let's discuss a bit deeper the Application Centric Infrastructure launched last week. When we look back five years from
now, I believe we will see ACI as a pivotal point in redefining IT. We were very pleased with the response to the
launch, but we were not surprised. We designed a system in ACI that would address the most pressing needs over our
vast global customer base, companies, governments, and service providers of all size. An ecosystem of the major
technology companies, our peers, and competitors have publicly stated how strategic they believe the platform will be
in their future priorities, and major cloud, enterprise, and commercial customers have chosen the ACI architecture to
run their business.
This is Cisco at its best. We delivered innovation on an entirely different scale than our competitors, a system that
would drive revenue and productivity, reduce cost, and mitigate risk, protecting their existing investments and
future-proof, and this is the first time I've ever used that word, future-proof their solutions going forward. To quote
some of you, ACI is a game-changer and a significant step in the realization in the Internet of Everything. The two will
move closer to together, both the Internet of Everything and Application Centric Infrastructure, and move faster than
many people anticipate, and Cisco will be there to lead.
Fourth, we will continue to increase our commitment to you, our shareholders. As you can see from the announcement
today, our board has granted a new share repurchase authorization of $15 billion, which we intend to put to work. You
should expect that over the next several quarters we will exceed our commitment of returning at least 50% of free cash
flow to shareholders, just as we did this past quarter.
In summary, I want to thank our shareholders, customers, and partners for their support, especially those customers and
partners that were integral to our successful launch of ACI. In particular, I want to thank the Cisco family for working
together as a team to ensure that our company is in a solid position to capture the opportunities we see in front of us.

Melissa Selcher
Thanks, John. I wanted to clarify one comment John made during his product statements.
John T. Chambers
I'm sorry. Did I make a mistake?

We're not quite yet number one in blade server market. We are number two in the blade server market, but we'll get
there.

Rob, that's your assignment.

All right, so we'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that the sell-side analysts please ask only one question.
Operator, please open the floor to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hi, guys. Your guidance is very low, if I got the numbers right. It's about 11% sequentially – 11%
down sequentially for revenues. And I went back to October 2000, and I've never seen such a low number outside of
2008 or 2009. I'm looking at January 2009, and at that time the world was about to collapse, January 2009. That's when
all the problems hit the financial system, and I'm wondering. Why are you guiding so low for next quarter? It looks like
the environment may continue to be weak, but it's not as bad as it was in 2009 and certainly not as bad as it was in
2000, October 2000, et cetera. So what are the components of the weakness for next quarter? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay, so let me do both. Let me talk about the components of the weakness and the areas
we feel the strongest on. There are no comparisons in a major way to 2009 or 2001. You basically look at our business,
and let me answer that very crisply because I know it's a thought on many people's minds given what we've just guided
to. The U.S. enterprise and commercial, which are the areas that I watch for long-term U.S. economic growth, both are
in the high single digits. And, Rob, we feel pretty good about their pipeline going forward.
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: Absolutely.

<A - John T. Chambers>: Our federal team executed well in a tough environment, so our state and local government
and federal government is solid. Service provider we need to make improvement on, and we have a multiple-step
approach to how we're going to do that in terms of direction. You look around the world, the emerging markets, I have
never seen that fast a move in emerging markets. And that is something that when I talk with our industry peers, while
there are exceptions, most of my CEO counterparts can almost finish my sentence in terms of what's occurring. It's also
occurring with many of our customers, where if you were to talk about Brazil as an example, they can finish each
other's comments as CIOs about their business, whether it's the consumer business or whether it's the manufacturing
segment in terms of the direction. We're very comfortable with our leadership and our share of spend gains in the
marketplace.
We do have to work in three areas. In terms of the focus on the emerging marketplaces, we are modeling for a
challenging next couple quarters. We believe that more than half the world's GDP occurs there, but we put in place a
plan over a year ago that we will continue to drive through the slowdown. Part of the reason, Gary, when we laid off
people was to free up resources to move to emerging markets. And you will see us increase our sales head count in the
appropriate emerging markets as we go forward to capitalize on that. We will literally expand, focus on a countrywide
prioritization. And if you watch what we did in Israel, which was clearly a developed country, we will do that across
other emerging markets. We will expand executive contact. And there will always be some unique situations where
Cisco needs to execute well in one of our top 15 countries or there are unique issues like exist in China. That's just part
of where emerging markets go.
The service provider focus, we are in the middle of a product transition. When product transitions occur at the CRS-X
and NCS level, you begin to see a hesitation on how much the customers buy the current products. Rob, your sales
team and Chuck's sales team have gone through and walked through where we are in that. But there's a natural
hesitation given uncertainty in the market and uncertainty in business leaders about how fast they will move through
these new platforms and how much they will continue to expand, which over time they absolutely will of the existing
platforms in terms of the direction.
Set-top box, we're going to take a 4% to 5% hit for a number of quarters in the future. What we're going to do on that,
however, is continue to accelerate the movement to the cloud, which has much higher gross margins. We've made some
leadership changes, as I said there earlier. And we're also going to work on really value-add engineering, Gary, which I
think your supply team has done an amazing job, so that we can look for more deals that would add better profits as we
move forward.
We're not going to change the organization structures that we have. We are organizing business entities with what
works fine. But we are going to change in terms of having a couple key leaders go across the whole company, just like
we did in enterprise with Chuck Robbins and Rob Soderbery with myself and Pankaj [Patel] flying cover, help them to
prioritize resources throughout that segment of the market. And we'll apply the resources to where areas that we had
not moved as much resources, especially since now we've done a good job at the high-end core to other segments.
That's a summary of the position, Tal.
What happened was we were $600 million to $700 million short of what we expected orders to be in this last quarter,
and it was almost all back-end loaded and literally down to the last two weeks. We were disappointed by multiple
hundreds of millions in terms of what normally flows in the last couple weeks. You have that shortfall not be in
backlog going into the next quarter. And when you look at your sequentials, Tal, you have to go off this new number as
you look going forward. You add the two together, that's a $1.2 billion challenge. Frank, what would you add to that?
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: No, I think you covered it, John. Clearly, the key thing is what you said, material shortfall
in orders in the back half for Q1 and specifically as we saw in October. This immediately hits not only affected our Q1
performance with the revenue being shorter than what we had provided in our guidance or even looking at the
midrange of our guidance, but it also ended up with a significant shortfall in the backlog at the end of Q1, and that
affects the business opportunity that we have going into Q2. And then overall if you look at the business momentum
now in Q2, specifically in emerging markets and service providers as you articulated earlier, those businesses is where
we're most challenged in Q2. When you look at that, offset by the related impacts that we have with the services

business that ties to that as well, that results in the guidance that we provided.

And your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hello, Ben.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Good afternoon, thank you. Hi, couple things that you didn't mention, but I was wondering in
emerging markets especially. There has been a lot of concern out there about the NSA snooping and the impact that has
had on global IT and global IT brands like yourself. And you maybe alluded to this with regard to your comments on
China and the political situation, but I noticed Russia was perhaps down even more than China and whatnot. Do you
feel that there's something more going on? We're all floored by your guidance here. But is there something a little more
to this that with customers outside of the U.S. thinking a little bit more about U.S. IT brands, and is that impacting your
business? And if so or if not, then what do you do in the future? Thanks a lot, John.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. Ben, I think if you look at it, it is an impact in China. I think we're all aware of that. I
think its total impact on the total emerging country business, however, is fairly nominal. I do think we are seeing a
slowdown in these emerging markets both in the decision-making and their economies. And so I do not think it is a
major factor across all of emerging. I do think it is a factor, however, in China. Rob, would you add anything to that?
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: I would just add, John, that this issue has caused increasingly customers to pause and another
issue for them to evaluate in all of those complexities that you've already discussed. So it's not having a material impact
but it's certainly causing people to stop and then rethink decisions, and that is I think reflected in our results.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great.
<A - John T. Chambers>: I think, Ben, what you're articulating and we're trying to do too, the amount of inconsistent
data is just causing customers to hesitate, including at the country level.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Ben; operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you, and our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs & Company.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi, thanks very much. So it sounds like one of the issues you're dealing with is the
transition on the routing side of the business. And obviously you just introduced some fairly large platforms on the
switching side, which is even larger than your routing business. Would you expect to see a similar pothole basically in
the switching business in the next couple of quarters as you work through that?
<A - John T. Chambers>: That's what we've modeled into it. It won't be a hole, but the growth will not be what we
would normally experience. Once again, the sales teams have it set up by products, by individual areas, but you
combine with just a very slow spending environment. And, Simona, let me back for a second. When I talked to CIOs,
and I'll just use the [CIO Technology] Business Council as an example, half the CEOs that they surveyed, Chief
Executive Officers they surveyed believe the economy is going to grow between 0% and 2%. They're modeling their
budgets conservative. And as they think through this, the CIOs will hesitate as they have product choices. It doesn't
mean they won't continue to buy our core [Nexus] 7000s and other products; they will. But they're going to strike a
balance of what do they want to do in terms of the mix and as they can get through.
So yes, we had modeled into this in Q2 and Q3. And yes to the indirect part of your question; as you come into Q4 and
come up to Q1 of next year, with all the appropriate caveats because of where we are on product cycles, where we are

in terms of what we're going to double-down on in some of the things we need to address, my goal for our company is
to get back to positive revenue growth in Q1 and ideally in Q4. But that's a stretch goal with all the appropriate caveats
associated with it. So you will have product cycles working toward that. You will have our momentum in the market
working to it, and I think that is what our expectations are. You saw Frank's bookends on the earnings. We did that
deliberately so that you could understand the areas that we're operating in, Simona.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Simona; operator, next question, please?
Operator
And your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS Securities.
<Q - Amitabh Passi>: Hi, guys. I was just trying to understand your guidance again in the context of your deferred
revenue growth. It seems like you've got pretty strong growth both sequentially and year over year in product revenue
growth – sorry, product deferred revenue growth, so I'm just wondering. Again, I'm really perplexed by the guidance
here. I understand some of the pain points you identified, but maybe you could just shed some light there.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: So if you look at the deferred revenue, Amitabh, the deferred revenue was up around 11%.
If you look underneath what that is, that shows a lot of the business that we have on the collaboration side, which is
moving to more of the recurring. So we have more deferral associated with some of the offerings that we have there.
That's a majority of what that is. So that's good news from the perspective it starts to show some of the momentum that
we have in the collaboration business. It's one of the businesses, as John mentioned earlier, that we have been really
investing in on the product portfolio over the past year, and we're looking at this product set over a longer period of
time. We're also looking at some of the models that our customers are looking to purchase, and some of that is going to
be more of a recurring revenue model, which is improving the deferred revenue.
<A - John T. Chambers>: An example on that, Amitabh, would be security with the movements on Sourcefire. It was
an area that really began to take hold this quarter. I think our customers realize we are very serious about moving to be
the number one security player. You will see us expanding consultancy in this area. And as we did that, even our
network security grew 12%, which it had not grown, as you all know, for a very long time.
But in the security, if you look at this next year as we reported, and we'll report, Mel, and I want to make sure we
deliver on the commitments, we'll report booking growth and revenue growth. And it would not surprise me in these
areas to see booking growth in the low 20%s and revenue growth in the low 10%, 11%, 12% because of the conversion
to future deferred revenues in licensing. So we are moving as fast as we can because Gary is balancing this model for
us. It is a juggling act in terms of how do we move to recurring revenues, to more applications, so that more and more
of our business is a given each quarter and we can be more where most of our peers are where they get the majority of
their business already done before they enter a quarter. But it takes you a while to get there, and that is also built into
our factors, Amitabh.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: And the number I gave, that 11% year on year for product. And then the services was up
about 2%, total deferred revenue up about 5%.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Amitabh; operator, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: I have a question. I just want to clarify on the guidance again, and this is for John and
Frank, I think. It sounds like – I understand the set-top box issues and how that's impacting revenue growth. I
understand the emerging market macro issue. In China, there's more than just a macro issue, it sounds like. So I'm
curious, John, how you fix that. It seems that's a very complicated, highly political subject. Then on the service

provider side, did the actual product transitions impact on your revenues or orders actually surprise you? I would have
thought you would have known about that going into this period of time. Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay, so in reverse order, a series of questions, but I think all very fair. Understand the way
that we do our revenue and booking forecast is we have a very good sales team, and they roll up the forecast and we do
it by regions and by countries and by products. We then based upon that forecast determine what our revenue guidance
is for a quarter. Now they take into consideration what they see in the product pipeline, what percentage of their
pipeline they expect to spill out, very, very detailed approach to it. The field force, however, almost never gets [ph]
elbowed (49:12), up or down. And the pace of change that you're really seeing in this, Kulbinder, is that it's almost
what occurs in a quarter just a year ago will now be two or three quarters' worth. And it was almost – if you were to
pick a quarter you didn't want to end on, it was literally October this year due to the uncertainties in terms of the
balance on that.
But no, in terms of the product transitions, just 120 days ago when we reported the last quarter, none of us anticipated
the change in Washington, the uncertainties, the business confidence that would occur from this. And I'm not making
excuses. This is what the customers are telling us. And in terms of their going into next year, their expectations are
down for the year, their budgets are down for the year, they are not taking as much risk. Now the good news is this can
turn around just as quickly as it slows. But in terms of the overall approach, there were positives and there were
negatives in the groups. And it was a quarter of very inconsistent data, much like we articulated, that our customers see
in terms of the economics and other issues.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great, thanks, Kulbinder; operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you and our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Hi, John.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: I have a couple questions for you. First, can you give us a little rundown on switching in terms
of how you see that campus versus data center switching, how you see both of those doing over the next couple of
quarters? And then with regard to your guidance, you do talk about gross margins still being in the 60% – 62% range,
even with revenues down like this. Is this mix; i.e., lower set-top box sales, or is it something else with regard to what
you're doing to manage the margins in that range? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure, so a number of questions. And I want the first one again; I'm going to answer the
gross margin question. Gary, we've done a very, very good job on gross margins. We're focusing on that across the
board. Our guidance has been very consistent, 61% – 62% gross margins for a long time, Frank. And we don't see
things material in the market that caused us uncomfortable with that.
We have done a very good job on value engineering, a very good job on modeling this out, a very good job of
designing our new products, and it might have slipped by some people. When we say we design them for the current
gross margin level, we've never been able to do that before. And we did that following some of our experiences back in
2011 and 2009. So we learned. We do it different in terms of the direction. We are continuing to anticipate set-top
boxes falling, and that is built into our next several quarter phenomenon. Now I missed the first part of the question, I
apologize.
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: It was switching mix.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Switching, Mel won't let me talk about a specific quarter in terms of the guidance, so let me
fast-forward to summer this next year. Summer this next year we will have the best switching architectures in the
industry by ourselves. We basically will take all the advantages of merchant silicon and custom silicon and put them
together. We will bring the promises of SDN to life literally in an open and simplistic way. And it won't be slideware.

This will be complete production, and it will literally accomplish the separation of applications from the infrastructure
with a common policy.
So if you look at it across all of our switching lines for the Nexus 5000, Nexus 7000, you begin to look in terms of what
we're doing with the Nexus 9000 with Insieme. And you begin to look at Rob Soderbery's product group, which I think
he has completely refreshed, Rob Lloyd, if I remember right. Our switching portfolio is the strongest it has ever been in
the marketplace and looks really solid.
To the indirect part of your question on the routing side, we feel equally as good. I like where we are with the high-end
products. And remember, NCS is an architecture. It's the nervous system of making all this work. And with the CRS-X,
it has the new capabilities of the same chip designs, et cetera, we put on NCS. So high end, we're never going to let that
get taken away from us again. It happened ten years ago, never going to let it happen. But now we need to move
resources to be able to address the access level, where this is an area at the low end we have to do better, and this is
where a couple of our competitors are doing well. At the high end, VPN capability, ASR 9000 actually is growing
comfortably, over 20%. But there are other legacy products we have to do better.
So in terms of product portfolio, it really looks good. Our ability to bring them together looks good. We've got to I
think pick up our game in a couple areas in service provider to think of solution selling as opposed to box type of
selling. And that we're going to have Pankaj Patel, who is our Head of Engineering, and Nick Adamo, who is the Head
of the Americas, do together with myself and Pankaj flying cover for them to be able to address this. And when we
started on this on the enterprise, Gary, a year ago, enterprise at that time did not really have the pieces together because
the business entities are great on products but not combining them. And you combine that with Gary and Edzard's
services, you can certainly provide a solution to service provider the same way. I've run this strategy off of several of
the top CEOs in the country and in the world on the service provider side. They'll buy into it if we can execute.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Brian; next question, operator?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen.
<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: John, I apologize. I know this question has been asked 18 ways to Sunday.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay, we knew it would be asked again.
<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: In trying to parse out your commentary about emerging markets, service provider as a
general proposition in terms of it being the bulk of the weakness, and your commentary from a timing standpoint
regarding the last two weeks of the quarter, two questions here. One, I assume what you saw in the last two weeks of
the quarter has extended into the first two weeks of November. And secondly, can you give some additional color on
top of what of what you've already said in terms of those two different issues, the collapse in the last two weeks, the
very recent vintage collapse, and the more generic commentary about emerging markets and service provider?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay, so the first two weeks of a new quarter are not really indicative of where you go, but
the last two weeks of last quarter was really tough. So no, it did not carry over in that type of format. I think you
deserve a fair answer to that – not deserve, we want to be very transparent on it, and I think it's the right way to answer
your question in terms of the direction. The second part of the question was?
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Mainly around the last two weeks of the collapse, and I don't think you characterized it as a
collapse. It was more around the last month being slower and normally we pick it up and we didn't.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yes. Paul, if you look at it, just using Q4 as an example, we went into the last month a little
bit off the numbers we expected. The forecast came down and the last two weeks of the quarter, they actually came up
$300 million over their forecast. That did not happen. This sales team is really good. And so the fact that we missed it
that much in the last month and that much in the last two weeks, we clearly factored in assuming that we're going to
continue to see challenges in this quarter and the next quarter. So we did build that in. Hopefully, it will be

conservative, but we always believe when you see trends on this broad a basis, especially in the emerging, you have to
adjust to it and say it will last for a couple quarters.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: The second part was a little more color on what we saw in emerging.
<A - John T. Chambers>: What we saw in emerging was very consistent across the board. Every one of top ten
emerging countries missed their forecast and was off by a fair amount. So it wasn't just that it was down the last couple
weeks; they kept dropping and dropping. I think, Rob, if I remember right, it was over half of our shortfall the last
couple weeks versus forecast.
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: Yes, it was John, and our top five emerging countries all had negative performance in the
quarter between I think it was a low of 18% to a high of 30% down. So those are the big ones that really contributed to
the numbers, and it was consistent across all of those major countries.
<A - John T. Chambers>: I would rather it had been a couple countries, Paul, because then you can say let's go fix
them. And there are always a couple countries that we'll either have issues on, some of them we create ourselves, some
of them are done to us, some of them are way beyond our control. But the consistency of that number is what
concerned me. And we usually unfortunately see things a couple quarters ahead of our peers. This time we were a little
bit surprised. We saw the softening in Q4 and we were very upfront with it to everyone about what happened in our top
five emerging countries in Q4, where we said they went from 13% growth the quarter before to flat in Q4. The other 15
countries continued to grow in low teens. This time all of them came down. And so out of our top ten, it was pretty
brutal on that. The fact that a player like IBM saw too, has probably 60% of their business given in a quarter and saw it
at this extreme indicates what we think is going to be more of a industry phenomenon, not affecting everyone but
candidly affecting a lot of people.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: All right, thank you; operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark Sue>: Thank you; Frank, just a quick one. Does the guidance include Sourcefire? And a question for you,
John; if I think about Cisco, the company has a lot of product, a lot of regional breadth, and your portfolio approach
typically gives you balance. So if one region or segment underperforms, there's usually an offset by another region or
segment that is outperforming. So we're not getting that historic offset, and instead we're getting this deterioration. So
I'm just wondering if you feel that this is maybe a structural change to the switching and routing and data networking
market. And it does sound as if it will take several quarters at least to refill the drained backlog. Was there some
consideration to reset your 5% to 7% long-term top line growth rate? And should we also plan for some more OpEx
cuts as you protect your earnings?
<A - John T. Chambers>: I'm going to have Frank comment about it overall for you on OpEx. I want to address first
the structural change. It's actually the reverse. If you watch what we're doing, the architectures take time to sell. Our
customers buy into it.
Mark, if you would have been at the CIO conference, and I encourage you to go watch it; Mel, it's up on the website
isn't it? We had 95 of the top CIOs around the world in the session. We asked them about every major high-tech player.
Now we deliberately didn't show their hands because that wouldn't have been fair, but we asked them where they were.
Out of the whole room, and it shocked me because I knew there were a couple critics. When I asked them how many of
you are going be more committed to Cisco and were going to your key partner, more of a key partner a year from now
than you were a year ago, the whole room raised their hand. And I walked out into the audience and looked a couple
people in the eyes and they said, John, we are a believer. When we asked about the other IT players on that, no one
more than ten raised their hand on any of the other top six IT players in terms of that type of commitment.

Mark, what that says is we've got our vision and strategy right. We've nailed it. They know we've nailed it, and they
said now let's see you execute. And then they said, by the way, security would be one you ought to go after much more
aggressively because we can't solve it, and it's our top issue in terms of the direction.
So the structural change, the answer is no. We've got it right in terms of the products. Our customers know that. You
saw it in the ACI launch. Look at the ecosystem that was up there with us. It was commanding. It was powerful. Look
at the customers up there with us. When you have the top cloud players from Europe literally on the stage with you and
talking about why they're committed to this architecture, when you have players such as EMC and NetApp there in
terms of here they see the opportunity, you have a Microsoft literally sit on stage. And if you watch that for five
minutes, it was probably the most articulate view of where they see the industry going and why they're going to align
with us on ACI from Satya [Nadella], who is one of the top players there, and he gets it.
So no it's not a structural issue. We do, however, any structure that you have in engineering has strengths and
limitations. And so when you're focused on products, and we've done an amazing job, Gary, on the product verticals,
that's a very effective structure you have. We now need to leverage across it to combine these and be able to move
resources around to where either our opportunities are or our exposures. And so that when you finish in high-end
routing and you've done extremely well and you got your leadership, how do you align resources quickly to say let's go
to very low-end access? And this is where you need and this is why we're putting two of our best on it. And by the way,
those are the same two who did this three and a half years ago and who got our leadership in service provider to be able
to say work across the group, combine it with services, and combine it in terms of go-to-market.
In terms of the 5% to 7%, you would be disappointed and shocked in us if after just a quarter and a cycle here with
emerging markets and something in service provider that we can and will correct if we suddenly said we're going to
change things. We'll listen very carefully. We'll provide more guidance in December. But in terms of winning, we're
winning big, and you all know this. You talk to customers. You talk to other channels. We have some issues that we
can do better. We're going to address that. But you have issues in terms of the emerging markets, which are largely, in
our opinion, macro driven, and we will power through that. We're going to do exactly what we did before during
slowdowns. Other people will pull back. We will put more resources in. We'll come out of it stronger and larger market
shares.
We have – you never say no pressure or John and Frank would kick me, but we have no abnormal pressure on gross
margins. Gary, what the team is doing across the board on that, the execution is world class. Even our low-margin stuff,
we continue to do value engineering on it and the direction. The reason I'm going on a little bit longer is we have all the
pieces here. Barring a huge surprise, we're going to be the number one IT player. And none of our customers say you
haven't got a shot at it. They say you've got to execute. But if you watch, none of the other players are aligned with us,
and none of the other players are able to look you all in the eye and say on gross margins we aren't facing major
pressures. We've done extremely well there. So I don't think it's a structural issue on it. I think it's literally the three
issues we talked.
New product transitions, which by the way we are not going to ever get behind again at the high end, I've done that
once. That is painful and it took us four or five years to get it back. We are now at the high end switching. Nobody
matches what Insieme does on this. High-end routing, nobody can touch what we did in terms of the routing or the
throughput to download the whole Netflix library in one second across your technology.
So I feel very comfortable with where we are and very comfortable we'll win on it, but we will always be transparent.
We promised you all when we see something, we'll tell it exactly like it is even if it's painful. And I'll ask you again
today you want to be sure you want to, but this is what we're seeing. Hopefully, we're being conservative. And, Frank,
to the question I think was on expenses?
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: There were two questions. One, Mark asked if Sourcefire was included in the guidance,
and the answer is yes. And secondly, as far as looking at – you were asking about op expense and restructuring. We
talked last quarter about the portfolio that we were carrying into FY 2014, making the adjustments to ensure that we
were making the investments and being able to afford the acquisitions that we did like Sourcefire, like Composite
Software, to maybe make sure that we were emphasizing areas in the portfolio we had felt that were growth

opportunities like security, like mobility, like cloud, like services, and we put plans in place to be able to do that.
We feel right now we've got to continue to execute to that. We do have more just continuing on what we announced.
On the restructuring, we did some this past quarter. We still have another quarter outside the United States, which was
part of the plan. And then the other important thing is to make sure that as we go through the fiscal year that we
continue to make sure that we follow up too on those investments, both the acquisitions as well as the internal
investments, so that we can see the ability for long-term growth.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Mel, I know we ran a little bit over versus our goal of being through by 2:30, but thank you.
Let me turn it back to you.
