Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our second quarter results, and I'm obviously
happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues were $9.1 billion. Net earnings, $2 billion. Earnings per diluted share, $4.10, and our annualized return on
common equity was 10.9%. The operating environment for our businesses was mixed during the second quarter with
favorable conditions in certain businesses and headwinds in others. It was an environment that in the end reinforced the
benefits of a global diversified business and a strong client franchise. All of this helped position the firm to continue to
generate strong relative returns.
Over the course of the second quarter, there was a lot of focus across the industry on the challenges facing
market-making businesses, most importantly, how an environment defined by low volatility weighed on client activity
and risk appetite. Given how much has already been discussed on this subject, I won't go through the statistics. Suffice
it to say, and in several markets, volatility is at historically low levels.
During the quarter, we continued to see an increase in CEO confidence and a significant pickup in M&A activity.
Year-to-date, announced M&A is up more than 70% to $1.8 trillion for the industry. It is nearly double that rate for our
firm. Historically, increased M&A activity has been a favorable sign for a few reasons. First, it traditionally coincides
with a positive trend in economic activity and client sentiment. Second, it generally translates into greater client
activity; for example, currency, interest rate, or commodity hedging.
During the second quarter, financing markets also remained strong, driving our clients' demand for debt and equity
underwriting services. As you would expect, rising asset prices created a favorable environment for our equity and debt
investments. The quality of the underlying portfolio and favorable markets have also helped to drive eight straight
quarters of strong investing and lending revenue performance. And finally, continued success in growing and
preserving our clients' wealth has driven solid net asset flows within our investment management business. I'll talk
more about this later, but it is important to note that assets under supervision reached another record this quarter,
finishing at $1.14 trillion.
So while Institutional Client Services is currently facing a lower level of client activity, our other businesses are seeing
significant demand for our services. In a mixed operating environment, it's all about being diversified and staying close
to our clients. Historically, this has been critical to generating superior returns. It's as relevant today as ever.
Now, let me take you through each of our businesses. In Investment Banking, we produced second quarter net revenues
of $1.8 billion, flat with the first quarter. Our Investment Banking backlog increased during the quarter, reaching its
highest level since 2007. As you would expect, advisory activity was a significant driver of the increase.
Second quarter advisory revenues were $506 million, down 26% from a strong first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman
Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions
that closed during the second quarter, including Sallie Mae's $7.2 billion spin-off of its Education Loan Management
business and the Illinois Tool Works' $3.2 billion sale of its Industrial Packaging segment to The Carlyle Group.

While the reduction in completed transactions quarter-over-quarter contributed to the sequential decline in revenues,
we experienced a significant increase in announced M&A, which should benefit future quarters and is reflected in the
growth of our backlog. For example, we're advising on DIRECTV's $67.1 billion sale to AT&T, Covidien's $42.9
billion sale to Medtronic, and Holcim's combined €40 billion merger with Lafarge.
Moving to Underwriting, net revenues were a record $1.3 billion in the second quarter, up 16% compared to the first
quarter results, with significant strength in Europe. Equity underwriting revenues of $545 million were 25% higher as
industry-wide activity increased in the second quarter across IPOs and secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman
Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs.
Debt underwriting revenues increased 11% sequentially to a record $730 million due to issuance activity in the
high-yield market, particularly in merger-related activity. During the second quarter, we were committed to meeting
our clients' diverse financing needs, whether it was Apple's $12 billion investment grade offering, the A$2.3 billion
financing of Transurban Group's acquisition of Queensland Motorways, or B&M Value Retail's £1.1 billion IPO.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were
$3.8 billion in the second quarter, down 14% compared to the seasonally stronger first quarter. FICC client execution
net revenues were $2.2 billion in the second quarter. Excluding DVA, net revenues were down 22% sequentially,
reflecting reduced levels of client activity during the quarter. Currency was higher sequentially, although volatility in
volumes remained relatively low. Mortgages was roughly flat, while credit decreased modestly. Interest rates declined
compared to the seasonally stronger first quarter. Commodities' revenues declined significantly following a robust first
quarter as volatility and client activity decreased.
Total net revenues for Equities in the second quarter were $1.6 billion. Excluding DVA, results were up 2%
sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues of $483 million for the second quarter were up 16%
quarter-over-quarter. Commissions and fees were $751 million, down 9% relative to the first quarter on weaker
volumes. Securities services generated net revenues of $373 million, up 6% sequentially due to seasonally stronger
client activity.
Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the second quarter was $77 million, down 6% relative to the first quarter, mostly
due to lower equity VaR. The overall decline was driven by both lower levels of volatility and risk.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, each businesses produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in
the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting company-specific
events, including financings, as well as divestitures. Net revenues from debt securities and loans was $604 million, and
benefited from net gains on certain investments and net interest income. Other revenues of $215 million included
revenues in the firm's consolidated investments.
In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion. Management and other fees were
up 4% sequentially to a record $1.2 billion, reflecting the increase of assets under supervision. Following a large
performance fee in the first quarter, incentive fees were down quarter-over-quarter. During the second quarter, assets
under supervision increased $59 billion to a record $1.14 trillion. This growth was driven by long-term net inflows of
$21 billion into fixed income assets. We also had market appreciation of $23 billion principally in equity and fixed
income assets.
Let me provide you with some detail on our Investment Management business. There are a couple of current themes
that are really important to our clients. First, clients are concerned about the potential for rising interest rates. As a
result, we saw institutional private wealth and retail clients seek unconstrained fixed income strategies. Second, our
clients are focused on outsourcing portfolio management functions to both create greater efficiencies and focus on their
core competencies. They are also engaging us as an advisor to gain expertise and enhance the decision-making around
asset allocation, portfolio manager selection and risk management. The demand for an outsourced asset management
function and advisory services, particularly for our insurance clients, also contributed to net inflows for the quarter.
Additionally, many clients have been looking for other opportunities to generate incremental yield and uncorrelated
returns in their portfolios. As a result, we saw continued net inflows into our yield focus strategies as well as our liquid

alternatives funds. And finally, clients have a continuing demand for defined contribution retirement solutions. We
have been focused on growing our defined contribution product offering. To that end, we completed the acquisition of
Deutsche Bank's Stable Value business, which contributed $11 billion of inflows this quarter.
Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior year equity awards and other items, such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 43%,
which is consistent with the accrual for the first half of 2013. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.4
billion, up 4% sequentially due to higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings.
Total staff at the end of the second quarter was approximately 32,400, down 1% from the first quarter. Our effective tax
rate was 30.3% year-to-date. The lower rate this quarter was driven by earnings that were permanently reinvested
abroad as well as changes in the earnings mix.
Moving to capital, as I mentioned on our last conference call, the Federal Reserve approved the firm coming off the
parallel run and therefore starting this quarter, our capital ratios are subject to the transitional provisions of Basel III.
Our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio was 11.4% using the advanced approach. Under the standardized approach,
our ratio was 10.9%.
During the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion.
Now, I'd like to spend some time on our balance sheet. Over the past few months, we have received greater clarity on
the role of the balance sheet across a variety of regulatory requirements, most notably CCAR and the supplementary
leverage ratio. During the quarter, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of our balance sheet. We began the process
by examining the return on asset characteristics associated with different businesses. Through that analysis, we
identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings potential.
As you would expect, the quarterly reduction largely impacted lower return asset activities within our matchbook and
other secured financing transactions.
On managing our balance sheet, we've achieved a number of benefits. First, we responded proactively to comply with
regulatory developments. Second, we improve the overall efficiency of our balance sheet. And third, we position the
firm to provide additional risk capacity to our clients if needed. Going forward, we will continue to assess our
positioning to ensure that we comply with new regulations and remain prudent allocators of an increasingly important
financial resource.
In closing, our management of the balance sheet is just one recent example of our firm's mindset and our broader
culture of adjusting to a changing environment. In the past, you've heard us use the words adaptable and nimble. While
adapting to an evolving backdrop is simple in concept, it can be difficult to implement. Successful implementation
requires many things. It requires a culture of collaboration. It requires a talented and dedicated team, and you have to
provide them with the necessary tools and analytics to make prudent risk return decisions.
However, the most important factor is our connectivity with our clients, their needs ultimately inform our actions.
Adaptability has always been important for our industry. However, it may be even more valuable in the current
environment given the numerous regulatory and economic changes underfoot. We do know that regardless of the
environment, adaptability has been and will continue to be an essential ingredient to serving our clients and producing
superior returns for our shareholders.
Thanks again for dialing in, and now I'm happy to answer any of your questions.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: First question was a follow up on your comments on the balance sheet reduction. I'm just
curious for any type of example of a low ROE business that doesn't have a broader client implication, that's helping
reduce the gross balance sheet. I'm assuming it's something in repo lend, but just more interested in learning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Glenn. Thanks for dialing in. So as I said, we started this exercise as we
got basically increasing feedback on role effectively that balance sheet was going to play. And one of the significant
inputs into the process obviously was CCAR. And so the way we approached it, and one of the good things about
working with the balance sheet is this notion and I'm oversimplifying it, but you can effectively sort your balance sheet
by return on asset, low to high. And that doesn't mean necessarily that although ROA activities can be taken down. But
in this case, it seemed like we had some opportunities that, as I said, would allow us to comply with the rules and give
us a lot more flexibility. One example would be the matchbook, which of the $56 billion reduction in the quarter, came
down $25 billion approximately.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. I get that. Maybe we could switch over to I&L for a second, and you mentioned the
results have been great now for eight quarters. I'm curious on the double-edged sword of the markets continuing to do
better and the environment is good, produces good revenues. But we still have that little shadow hanging over us. It's a
good shadow, but $9 billion or so in Goldman capital in the Investing & Lending function that eventually has to work
its way out. Good environment to work its way out, but I don't know if you could provide any update on the asset side
of what's in equity, debt, and lending buckets, how much of the $9 billion you've worked through and maybe if you're
working towards July of 2015 or July of 2017, because I know we don't know those rules yet?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That's a great question. So in terms of how we think about the process in terms of
complying with the rule, first, let me remind you this capital obviously sits alongside our clients in funds that our
clients are co-invested with us in. So we're harvesting at a pace that obviously makes sense for those funds and the
performance associated with those funds. I won't go through all the numbers. They haven't moved so materially since
the last time I gave you an update. But on the last call, when I walked you through basically a waterfall of flows, the
number ended up being roughly $9 billion and that was based on the January numbers. If you look at kind of midyear,
we're at an $8 billion number now, give or take.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess the no big change is just a function of markets keep
moving higher, so your assets grow with it. So you sell some, but it goes off. Okay, I got that.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I mean, with respect to the capital, the reality is that as it comes off, we have the
flexibility to point that capital in any way that we think is in the best interest of our clients and the firm where
obviously we can look to return it. And that'll be opportunity driven in the franchise.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Yes. And I've noticed some direct investments being made. That's cool. Last two are quickies.
One, what was the SLR ratio? And two, what's the geography of the market gain? Like what line item did it go
through?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So in terms of the SLR ratio, on the last call, we were at 4.3%, and then you have to
make some adjustments. During the course of the quarter, you probably saw that we issued $2 billion of preferred. That
adds 10 basis points to the ratio. That gets you to 4.4%. Balance sheet and other basic actions we took during the
quarter gets you up to 4.5%. And then again, an important fact on this is the one you mentioned earlier. As the capital
comes out of the funds, which is punitive from the standpoint of the significant financial institutions deduction, that has
to come out, obviously, before you have to be in compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio in 2018. When you
do that math, we're north of 5%.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got it. Cool. And the last clean up was just to the geography of the market gain.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, as you know, we keep all those items in our Investing & Lending section.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. In equities?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes.

Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: First one on just optimization of the balance sheet. So I understand a lot of the
commentary. I guess can you provide any color on maybe the return impact of the overall firm or what the returns were
in the areas that you're exiting? And when you look at the broader balance sheet and given the current relationships in
the activity levels, is there much more to do? Or was this the bulk of it, and you'll just keep an eye on it going forward?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as I said, the impact is de minimis. And that has a lot to do with how we approach
this. So at the beginning of the quarter, when we began this exercise, as a management team, we didn't pick $860
billion as a hard-line target. This is a very iterative process that we go through. We set multiple targets. And just to give
you a real sense, our initial target we basically said, look, let's work down to an $875 billion level. And as we went
through it, we realized that there was more capacity in terms of our ability to build in efficiencies and still work with
clients and really no impact at the margin. But importantly, as I said before, this allows us to comply with the rules and
again builds in flexibility in terms of how we deploy capital. In terms of how we go forward, the process will continue
the same way. There won't be hard targets to get down and we'll just continue to reassess.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, thanks. And then just on the Investing & Lending segment, so Glenn hit on the
capital side. I think just it's obviously a hard business to predict, and so maybe ex the mark-to-market gains that we'll
all try to predict, but can you give us any color on like the current MOIC or the IRR of the portfolio, the seasoning, like
normal exit premiums? Can you just – anything to get a sense on how things are doing and what we can expect over the
next couple of years as you're running it down or exiting those positions?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I mean, just for clarity purposes, obviously, the debt line has interest income in it; the
equity line has equity positions. To give you some sense of how we look at it in terms of the underlying quality of the
portfolio, if you look at the performance in the equity line this quarter, give or take, about two-thirds of the
performance was driven by IPOs, other event-related activity in terms of the quarter, and so what you're seeing is the
strength of the portfolio as we work through it.
In terms of predicting the pace, obviously, some of that is driven by market conditions. But that's really about how
these entities are run ultimately within the funds, and the performance has been good. And again, I know there's always
some skepticism about the future performance, but as I pointed out, when you look at the last eight quarters, it's been
pretty steady. So we'll see how it goes over time, but the quality of the portfolio feels good.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. And then just Investment Banking and Investment Management, in both of those
segments, the trends have been very strong and it's been fairly consistent. When you look at the outlook, obviously the
M&A backdrop, that's easy to see, but when you look across those two segments, where do you see the big
opportunities at this point in the cycle, versus are there areas where you're starting to get concerned or the risks are
rising in the overall market that we could start to see some decrease in activity?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. So why don't we just start with the Advisory business? I mean, I think if we were –
when we were doing this call a year ago, there was a lot of concern or question around, look, almost – well, for lack of
better language: will M&A ever come back? And now we sit here in an environment where there's lots of activity. And
maybe in retrospect, sitting here, that doesn't look surprising, because as sentiment shifts and CEOs get more confident
and global economic activity stabilizes, starts to grow, you start to see it. For us, during the slower part of the cycle, the
slower part of the cycle was really aimed at making sure that we stayed connected with our clients. And I think you see

it in some of the statistics. For transactions greater than $1 billion, we were in 60 of the transactions out of 175 and
that's, give or take, roughly a 35% market share. And as I mentioned on the call, our market shares have continued to
grow on a relative basis during this.
Now, when you think about other parts of the Investment Banking set and you think about debt, this was a big
discussion again we had last year. I remember we hit a record in debt performance in the first quarter of last year and
there were a lot of questions about whether that's sustainable. So I think as economic growth continues to improve
globally, the opportunity for Goldman Sachs to provide advice to our clients, capital to our clients, I think it feels pretty
good, but it'll be environment-driven, but it seems like there's some capacity from here.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, thanks a lot.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Christian.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Hey. In the past you've spoken about the strategic importance of growing the Wealth
Management business. There's been some talk in the marketplace about Goldman expanding their business by
acquisitions. Can you remind us about your ambitions and growth plans for that business and how you think about
using M&A for growth?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So the business has been a strategic growth focus for us for a number of years. We've
taken a number of steps in that business, and this goes back multiple years, to really improve performance. And what
you're seeing is sustained quality of performance, which is now driving pretty significant inflows and growth into the
business.
In terms of acquisitions, our philosophy on this has been pretty straightforward. If we believe it's accretive to the
business and we can provide value to our clients, we'll consider them. I mean, largely what you've seen us do are
bolt-ons. I mentioned Deutsche Bank Stable Value business. That follows an acquisition we did a couple of years ago,
and that's about building scale in a space where we feel we can provide value.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Just switching over to FICC, I apologize if I missed this on
prepared remarks, but clearly June saw an improvement in activity levels. Could you provide a bit more color on which
businesses and which regions did better? And also, I would appreciate any insights into how July is progressing so far
relative to June.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So in terms of the quarter, as we all saw in the beginning of the quarter, there were some
pretty negative forecast as related to kind of general client activity across Fixed Income and Equities. As the quarter
went along and investors felt more comfortable, certainly post the actions of rate policy announcements out of Europe,
there was a more significant pickup in activity. But I would say that relative to historical markets, volumes and clearly
you're seeing in volatility levels really feel like they're bottoming a bit. But activity improved across the business
broadly.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Nothing on July, I take it then?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's too early to tell.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. That's fair. Just my last question really is more of a broader question on Goldman's
long-term competitive positioning. I guess the period post crisis was really marked by industry consolidation, and since
then, there's been significant growth in the non-bank financial sector. And as we move into a stronger macroeconomic

conditions, it seems to me that there'll be a lot of competition for Goldman's clients. I'd be curious on how you see
Goldman competing against, or competing in the sales and trading businesses against the balance sheet might and
customer flow that the money center banks enjoy and also how Goldman competes against less regulated firms such as
the independent M&A brokers and the alternative asset managers.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So why don't we start with Institutional Client Services. So we obviously have a
very long history in these businesses, and one of the things we benefit from is the diversification of the business. So
currency to commodities to interest rates. By the way, also the leadership position we have in equities, prime
brokerage, derivatives and our ability to commit capital has always been a defining characteristic for our clients. And
so we feel that our competitive position now relative to the rest of the market, it feels to us like it's a pretty good
position. And so we'll have to see how it evolves. We've seen pockets of areas where when volatility has picked up and
I talked about in the last quarter, for example, in commodities.
As far as we can tell, it felt like there were some kind of advantage given our commitment and long history in the
business when the markets were volatile. But these are pretty quiet markets. As we discussed, some of the most
historically low levels of volatility that we've ever seen. But the competitive position, when we think about our people,
ability to hire, the talent, it feels strong.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Thank you very much, Harvey and congrats on the strong quarter.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Can you talk a bit about some of the ancillary businesses or business that you get from
M&A and the timing of that? So obviously we've had a lot of announced M&A, and I guess I usually think about the
ancillary business occurring closer towards when the deals are actually completed. But just kind of the broader
conversation if you could talk a bit about some of the other businesses you get from the deals.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure. So as I mentioned, largest part of the growth in the backlog was in the announced,
and obviously we were extremely active in terms of our position in the marketplace. These transactions, as you know,
they can take six months to nine months to close. Lots of the transactions we've seen have either better cross border, or
they've had a debt component. And so there are a variety of different hedging elements that will go on associated with
those transactions where we're providing advice. In general, those corresponding activities tend to happen around
closure also. Not in all cases, but for the most part, given the fact that there's always uncertainty about whether a
transaction will be completed.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. So it's still a lot of that benefit one would think to come then.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Again, as I said, the backlog growth, which is the highest it's been since 2007, the
backlog growth quarter-over-quarter really was driven by M&A in the announced transactions.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And just a bigger picture question on rising rates on the Fixed Income businesses. I
guess in the old days, people used to think rising rates are bad for investment banks, because they hold all this
inventory and you get marks on the way up, although a higher rate environment once you get there might be better for
activity. But I've noticed that for the industry overall, the inventory levels have come down pretty significantly versus a
year ago. So I'm just wondering how you think about if you can split it like the impact of rising rates as it's occurring
versus once you get to a higher level?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's a great question. Sorry, were you going to say something else, Matt?

<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: No. Go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So it's a great question. If you look back in history in periods of rising interest
rates, it's all very contextual. A lot of it depends on the base that you're coming from, and whether or not the market
was expecting or not expecting to move in the first place. In the end, it all relates back to is the rise in interest rates
something that is a stimulus to activity. So we don't see inflation in the forecast.
If you had rising rates as a result of inflation and you had more struggling and unemployment, I think, generally
speaking, that would be bad for activity. But in an environment where it's more of a return to normal and we've been at
such managed low levels for so long, but in normal environment with good, solid, stable economic growth, that may
bode well for client activity. But again, it's all going to be activity based.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just lastly on the comp ratio, you have historically done adjustments in the
back half of the year, or usually in the fourth quarter, or I think last year you did some in the third quarter as well. And
just if you could comment on that especially in light of the, I think the FICC trading comps were pretty easy in the third
quarter a year ago, so how when we put it all together to think about the comp ratio at the back half of the year?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So the 43% that you've seen this quarter, the first half of the year and actually the first
half of last year, for this quarter obviously it's our best estimate of where we think we are. We're reviewing it every
quarter. Last year, you started to see some of the benefits maybe earlier than we have in the past versus the third quarter
versus fourth quarter just because of the cost savings that we had built into the enterprise. And so we'll continue to
evaluate it every quarter.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey. Thanks, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey, just a couple of questions. One's a ticky-tacky on the SLR that you mentioned earlier. I
know in your Fixed Income presentation from May, you had the SLR at the end of 1Q 2014 at 4.2%, and then the press
added the 10 bps to get you to 4.3%. So then on top of that, the balance sheet adjustments added another 10 bps to get
us to 4.4% at quarter-end? Is that the right math?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, so I have it at 4.3%, 4.4%, 4.5%. But there's rounding in there too, right? So when
you go back and forth.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then if we assume all of Volcker non-compliant $8 billion goes away, that's what
gets you to above the 5%?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So just to be ticky-tacky too, just so we're very clear, so the $8 billion is what still needs
to be managed after you take adjustments for things that are already public, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The significant
financial institution deduction itself is actually bigger. So that's $9 billion. And so once that's out, and with extensions
as you know the final compliance date is July of 2017, as we know it now, that precedes the 2018 SLR requirement.
That gets us north of 5%.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Is that clear?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yes. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. Great.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And then on the balance sheet freeing up that you did, the relatively low ROA assets that are
not necessarily helping clients as much, I mean, I would think that you're doing that in part ahead of this significant
M&A calendar that typically comes with lines of credit, bridge loans, et cetera. Is that fair?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No. We don't. Again, from that perspective, we feel like we have more than enough
capital adequacy and certainly more than enough liquidity in the balance sheet to support those franchise activities.
This really was directly correlated to basically information that we've gained from the discussions around
supplementary leverage ratio, and as I said, a significant factor is CCAR.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So then the M&A activity obviously announced as you indicated up significantly, so
we should have a nice second half year here into 2015. Any lines of credit that you're extending with those activities is
on your books today. Is that correct?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. And so the way they generally work is if we're committing to a financing, if we're
less lead then those show up as either unfunded commitments, or if they become funded they show up as funded
commitments, that's correct.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. Okay. And so part of that's already in the footings.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That's correct. Yeah.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just lastly, as the Volcker non-compliant rolls off and you're using the
capital to reinvest elsewhere, I'm thinking about the fact that your clients has been involved with you on these
non-compliant Volcker assets, because they are alternatives, they are giving you potentially uncorrelated risks,
uncorrelated returns, I'm sorry, and that there's certain elements of this that might look akin to alternative investments.
I'm just wondering what the strategy plan is for increasing your offerings in that area out of the Asset Management
business.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So in terms of the capital, I'll make a couple of points as it comes out. So obviously, we
run a very large Asset Management business, and those clients can participate in that Asset Management as they wish.
So obvious we run a very big Alternatives business aside from the capital that is in these funds. Also, remember, we
can invest those dollars in other Volcker compliant funds for our clients. So we can offer them those options. We can
also co-invest with them in Volcker approved structures, so there's enough flexibility where certainly we feel like we
can respond and deliver to our clients' needs.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. I get that. I'm just thinking there is some opportunity to expand the offerings even
further.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: If you want to – there certainly are as this capital moves around. But if you want to
follow up with Dane and the team later, we can break down for you a bit how the Alternatives' asset line actually
moves in terms of activities that we're being asked to exit and those that are growing side-by-side.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. That would be great. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure.

And your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with the CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I have three questions around balance sheet optimization. The first is what's left? So you
reduced total assets by $56 billion. How much more is there to go? And also the risk-weighted asset decline was only
$5 billion versus the $56 billion what's your priority looking ahead?

Page 11 of 24
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So that's a great question, Mike. So in terms of the balance sheet, again, we're going
continue to reassess as we go forward. Standing here today, there certainly may be some room, but as we approach the
third quarter, there are no strategic initiatives at this stage. But I would expected it to be around this area, but we will
see how things evolve. Again, it's going to be very much client driven.
In terms of the metrics, I'll use a great example of when we're complying with the various metrics, some are risk-based,
and those are less – those like the leverage ratio or leverage tests are by definition not risk-based. And so the reason
why you're not seeing a corresponding meaningful reduction in RWAs and you actually saw an increase in our Basel III
advance ratio from 11.3% to 11.4% is because this really is in response to those non-risk based measures.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Got it. As it relates to loan growth, what are your priorities for growing loans and do you think
that loan growth in the industry is accelerating?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, it's hard for me to see across the industry in terms of how it's accelerating. It feels
like it may have come off the bottom a bit, but I guess I would say the following, which is an important take away. So
lending for us has always been an important component of how we provide strategic capital to our clients. Obviously,
predominantly, our corporate clients and obviously an important component of our private wealth business. We don't
target loan growth. Again, these activities while well collateralized particularly for example in private wealth, while
well collateralized, again, this is risk-based capital. And so the way we manage it is through a limit process and through
an individual approval process. And so we'd be pretty reluctant to target loan growth.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Can you just elaborate on your comment? You said loan growth does not seem to be
accelerating? It's just a [ph] bounce off (42:55)...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, I said I don't have great view into the industry. It's been growing for us over the past
year when you look at it, and we've just seen opportunities to work with our clients more closely so we've been
extending more capital.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then lastly...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I don't have great view into the industry.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And lastly, if you felt confident enough to restructure your balance sheet and downsize it so
much, does that mean you have better – enough clarity on SLR and other regulations to set an ROE target anytime
soon? I know I ask that every quarter, but it seems like you're making progress.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I got to say, Mike, actually I don't think a quarterly call would feel complete for me if
you and I didn't have this discussion. So I think we should plan to have it next quarter and if need to we should have it
the quarter after that. I don't mean to make light but I do enjoy the discussion.
So how are we thinking about capital, and you're right, we're getting increasing clarity. In terms of our strategic
priorities over the last several years, we've been focused on a number of things. Most importantly, obviously growing
the franchise. And you're seeing pretty significant growth in areas where there's activity. Advisory services, investment
management, obviously we've seen more headwinds in other areas where there's been low volatility. But the most
important thing is our focus on our clients.
The second thing is about building and we've talked about this a lot, operating leverage into the business so that we're
positioned to grow returns when the environment improves and continues to improve. And so we're going through all
these steps. In terms of returns and absolutes, we're being disciplined about how we deploy the balance sheet, you saw
some of that this quarter. And in the end, Mike, look, we just aspire for better returns. In this environment, you've seen
us do give or take, 11% for two-and-a-half years. But we continue to look to aspire for better returns, and I think maybe
the balance sheet this quarter, even though it's just one quarter, taking it down $56 billion, I think that's a good example
of some of the steps we're taking.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I mean, the 11% ROE is so far below where you've been historically, the question is do you just
stay here for a long period of time?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, I don't know, Mike. First of all, I've never been quite good on these things, but we
could certainly have a discussion around if volatility picked up and you saw activity levels, I think that the future will
be what it will be. Again, what we've tried to do during this period where it's been so much lower is to find the right
balance. And by balance, I mean protecting our client franchise at the same time building these efficiencies. And look, I
think when you look at it over the cycle, I think our returns on a relative basis, they look pretty good. They've been
superior.

Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hey. First, I just wanted to revisit the tax rate comments that you made in terms of having
made some permanent offshore reinvestment decisions. Is this something that will continue and accelerate going
forward? Should we begin to think about tweaking down the core tax rate that we use in computing the earnings?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So there's two things here. One is obviously as we review capital needs around the globe,
in this particular quarter, we made an election to permanently reinvest capital. But it's also earnings mix driven. And so
in terms of the capital needs, I think you should treat that as a one-time event. Earnings mix will be what it'll be driven
by client activity around the globe.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. So this isn't a call to begin to shave a point or two off the tax rate that we use in
forecasting?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No. We're a high taxpayer.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Just wanted to make sure that we get fully phased in Basel III Ratios Core Equity Tier 1?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So again, the 11.4% was the transitional, and 10.9%. And the fully phased in would be
9.8% and 9.3%. Sorry...
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: 9.3%?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Advanced and standardized in that order. Is that right?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, that's correct.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay. I'm sorry?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I'm sorry, Guy. I misspoke. I said 9.3% and I should have said 9.4%
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: 9.4%? Okay, great. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: There's the transitional ratio, and then there's the fully phased. And so when I went
through it, I just misspoke. I apologize.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. That helps. Thank you. You obviously mentioned both in the release and the press –
and your comments before that head count's down about 1% off the end of last quarter. Obviously, not a big number,
but just makes me want to ask if you can give us, say, year-to-date what the puts and takes are, if not quantified, at least

where are you adding and where are you rationalizing by key line of business?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: All right. So, well, I think in terms of the aggregate, as we come into the third and fourth
quarter, our new analysts will be coming on board, so you should expect as year-end head count will continue to come
up a little bit. We've been very focused on the pyramid, as we referred to it over the last several years, and also
simultaneously investing in those areas that have been growing, like Asset Management. And Gary spoke about this at
a recent conference; if you take Fixed Income as an example, over the last couple of years, head count's been down
roughly 10%. And so it's very business-specific driven in terms of how we're adjusting the resources.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. So mostly down in Fixed Income, up in Asset Management, pretty much stable
everywhere else? Is that the right takeaway?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That's about right, and also I would say in general we feel pretty comfortable in terms of
how the global business is, right-sized at this stage.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And when you made that comment about the pyramid, does that refer to the fact that in order
to try to make the lifestyle implications for the junior staff a little bit more manageable, you've upsized, what, 10%,
15% in terms of the analyst class? Is that what you're talking about?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No. I was talking more about – I'm glad you asked me to clarify. I was talking more
about post-2008, when we normally get sort of a, call it, every other year series of retirements of partners, many people
elected to delay what otherwise were retirement plans. They just felt like they needed to be here, and so we've just seen
some acceleration of that, but it's been fully expected.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay. Yeah, that helps. Thanks. Final question, just to revisit the balance sheet
exercise that you went through, and then thanks for talking about that. That's very interesting. Is there some way that
you can quantify for us the ROE impact over the next year or two of having made the changes that you've made
assuming that you can do what you want to do with CCAR?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So obviously, we can't predict future CCAR results, and so that's difficult to assess. I
think when you think about how, any firm, certainly Goldman Sachs, needs to manage capital in an environment of
multiple constraints, it's about finding the right place to comply with the rules and at the same time building maximum
flexibility so you can be there for your clients when they need you to be, and when you have excess capital, be in a
position to return it. And that's what all these exercises are about.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So you didn't undertake it with the thought that if you optimize in this way, you could add
100 basis points, 200 basis points, 300 basis points over time to ROE in a normalized environment? It's more about, as
you said, being prepared to provide more risk intermediation when the markets call for that, that type of thing?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So the way I would think about it is less figuring out a target in terms of capital
flexibility and the CCAR process. But again, we don't have much visibility; we don't know what next year's test is
going to look like. The key driver of the exercise is the dialogue we have with clients as we undertake it. And so as we
work through that process and we feel the capacity's there, then obviously it's the more efficient way to deploy our
capital. And so we'll see how future CCAR tests go, but look, certainly having more capacity in terms of flexibility is
preferred. But again, the key driver is going to be how our clients – what our clients need from our balance sheet. And
as I said earlier, in this case, we were able to reduce the $25 billion out of the matchbook.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, okay. That's really helpful. I appreciate you taking my questions.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Of course, always.

<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hello there. I just had two questions, please. One was regarding the deductions, because I
was surprised that the look-through although fully phased in ratio haven't improved more. Could you just go through
those again? I think you mentioned an $8 billion number, but then also a $9 billion number?
And then the second question was really on the non-compensation expenses underlying. They seem pretty steady, give
or take, taking out litigation in the last three quarters or four quarters. Is there a target to keep them flat over a period of
time and is there quite a lot going on in the background for that to happen? Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So I'm really glad you asked the first question, because I certainly didn't want to
leave anybody confused on this topic. Those are different numbers. So that's the important takeaway, they're different
numbers. The first number, the $8 billion, that relates to the dollars in funds that we need to ultimately remove from
those funds as we harvest alongside our clients to comply with the Volcker Rule.
And the reason I highlighted that on the last call, it's roughly $9 billion, now it's a bit north of $8 billion, was when you
look at our financial disclosure, you would see roughly a $14 billion number in terms of total investments. But there are
capital allowances, there are assets that are already public, there are other funds that are approved, and so I just want to
make sure that you have some scale, and that number has moved down to roughly $8 billion since January. Okay?
That's one number. They just happen to be very close in size.
Under the Basel III capital rules, you get a certain allocation for which you're allowed to have dollars invested in what
they call significant financial institutions. For us, that is a dollar-for-dollar deduction from capital that is $9 billion.
Now as we comply with the Volcker Rule, that $9 billion comes out just side-by-side, which is why we give you some
sense of that and its future impact on our capital ratios. Is that clear?
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Just to clarify, the $9 billion deduction under the calculation you disclosed hasn't really
moved because maybe some other offsetting factors or...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So that number is driven by the aggregate, and so that number again is a different
number versus the $8 billion that is still in funds, but isn't yet public, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So that includes – for
example, that includes assets that are already taken public, but are still sitting in the funds and they're working through
the sell-down process.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Okay. I get you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: And just remind me, what was your second question Fiona, I'm sorry.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Just on the non-compensation expenses...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: [indiscernible] (55:22).
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: ... if you strip out litigation, they're very flat over a long period of time.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, so we're staying very focused on non-comp. As you know, several years ago, we
went through an exercise to take out roughly $2 billion of costs out of the enterprise. At this stage, we continue to stay
very focused on it, but there hasn't been any material movement.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure.

potential opportunity for FICC industry fee growth in the context of the paradigms, let's call it of FX and equity
electronification, suggesting that we could actually see some improvement in the revenue backdrop.
And I thought it was quite telling where flash forward to the Bernstein conference last month, I felt as though your
comments as well as Gary's were a bit more measured on the long-term outlook. And Gary specifically highlighted
some challenges to FICC digitization, and relating to that, he even made some explicit references to TRACE. And the
TRACE experience I guess my mind is more of a cautionary tale where you saw really meaningful spread compression
in terms of corporate bond pricing and only a modest volume improvement resulting in a net revenue decline.
So we're now four years into the adjustment process within FICC. And I'm wondering whether your fundamental
outlook for the FICC industry has changed and more specifically whether we should even read into Gary's explicit
references to TRACE in the context of your views on FICC?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So – well, let's back up and let's just take history into context a bit. In FICC, and
actually in equities, the advancements in technology, if you will, we would say that that's been a secular change, that's
been in place for well, well over a decade. And whether it was in equities where back in what some people call the
good old days, you had $0.06, $0.065 commissions which collapsed with electronification and decimalization and other
rules that the regulators put in place. I don't remember actually Gary's explicit comments about TRACE, but I think his
point was that when technology first gets adapted, there's an adjustment process that goes through.
Now if you look at it over multiple years, I think our experience with TRACE would be similar to the experience we
saw in the government bond market with Tradeweb and the same as I described with equities where you go through a
market adjustment period, but for example, in our – in TRACE, again, I don't remember exactly Gary's comments, but I
think he was mostly speaking about the high-yield market when it first came on board. At first when TRACE came on
board, it was actually disruptive to liquidity. That was the feedback we got from clients. But then as the market
adjusted, over time, we actually found that our leveraged finance and high-yield franchise got stronger.
Now I could give you a whole host of examples like that, again, the government bond market, when we started trading
government bonds on Tradeweb, everyone said that business was over, just like, by the way, they said the same thing
when the euro was created. And over time these businesses have generally – we've been in a position where we've been
able to provide more value to our clients, enhance liquidity to our clients. Now in terms of the last couple of years,
obviously the regulators have been quite effective, and I think they deserve a lot of credit for deploying clearing; we're
in the early stages of swap execution facilities. It's not our sense that those things have been headwinds for the
business. This has really been much more climate-driven in terms of the low volatility. But it's something we stay quite
focused on.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. So essentially, your view hasn't really shifted.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Now, that was a long-winded answer, but you did ask for big picture. So I apologize if
that was [indiscernible] (59:46).
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: No, no, it's extremely helpful, so I appreciate it.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No problem.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: And then shifting gears and moving onto preferred issuance and your capital structure, so
you noted that you had issued $2 billion of preferreds in the quarter. And to my knowledge you're the only universal
bank, which is actually at the 150 basis points RWA target that's contemplated under Basel III, which I guess I can
interpret it two different ways. Either you've taken advantage of the cheap cost of issuing preps in the current backdrop
and have no intention of tapping the market anytime soon, or in an effort to cover the current SLR shortfall, which
currently exists, you actually plan on issuing additional preps from here in order to optimize your capital structure. I
was hoping you could at least explain what's driving the preferred issuance plans going forward?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. So I think the simple question, are we full, we'll assess it as we go forward. You
also saw in the quarter that we launched a tender for trust preferreds, which is capital under the Basel rules didn't
qualify. And so you should think of this as adjusting in terms of again, in complying in response to the regulations. So
trust preferreds aren't considered valuable capital. So you'll see preferreds come into the mix.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: But do you have any intention of issuing additional preferreds from here? At least in, call it
the next in the near-term to intermediate term because you are essentially full.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, we'll continue to evaluate it and we'll see how we proceed. But again, this is all
part of our capital planning and consistent with our CCAR plan.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And then just one last one from me on the topic of I guess the term that we've used
internally is bindingness, but the need for U.S. [ph] SIFI's (61:40) to manage to the multiple binding capital constraints
that you had talked about earlier. And as far as we can tell, there is four constraints that really seem to matter. So you
have the two risk-based targets advanced and standardized. And clearly you screen quite well on those metrics.
Separately, we look at CCAR, and clearly you have been able to support outsized payouts over the last couple of years
while getting past the stress test.
And lastly, we have the SLR. And your comments indicated that you could – that pro forma, I suppose the reduction in
the Basel III deductions to financial [ph] and fully (62:24) into financial institutions that you'll be just above the 5%,
but when looking at required capital levels, it looks as though it's actually going to be highest under the SLR. And I
don't want to ask you for – once again for an explicit ROE target, I wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking
about the relevant binding constraints and how you plan on, whether you plan on optimizing your capital position based
on the four that I guess I just mentioned?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So as you mentioned, there are a number of constraints, mostly risk-based, right,
CCAR, Basel III, standardized, I'm sorry, advanced, standardized a bit mix but also risk-based, and then non-risk
based, which is the bucket I would put the leverage ratio or leverage test into.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: In terms of the supplementary leverage ratio, because we would agree with you based on
the Basel III advanced and standardized, lots of capacity at this stage. So let's again hone in on the supplementary
leverage ratio. A couple of factors. Again, we haven't seen the final rule. So we'll have to see the final rule in the
context of the denominator. We don't have to fully comply until 2018, and so the reason I give you the natural
adjustment that will happen in terms of the $9 billion coming out of funds is because it's such a tax on the current
capital position. And so as that comes out, you can see the flexibility. Now because we haven't seen the final rule, we
haven't really taken any steps to mitigate it.
As you know, our policy is to see the final rule, and when we see the final rule or have some very strong sense of the
final rule, then we're willing to look at how we should comply. Now how do we do that? And we've talked about this in
the past. But we'll, we begin again by providing tools to the businesses, and then as a leadership group, we figure out
the best way to deliver capital to our clients and at the same time comply with the rules. Now CCAR, CCAR obviously
has an annual test. Last year for us was a binding constraint. And so you'll see us adjust there as we can as well.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So how do I reconcile those comments that the rules haven't been finalized so you haven't
been actively mitigating with the balance sheet reduction that we saw in the quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as I said, the leverage ratio has an impact there, but also, CCAR a significant factor.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. That's extremely helpful, Harvey. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Always. Thanks, Steven.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning. Just a quick follow up maybe just on the balance sheet question. It was
very helpful you talked about the matchbook coming down $25 billion, but the total balance sheet down $55 billion.
Can you give any color on the other $30 billion?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's $56 billion in total roughly $25 billion out of the matchbook, with various back
and forth items in terms of just basically things I said, mostly secured clients financings, client cash, things like that.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. Just kind of broad based. And then if we think about...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Again, the take away lower ROA, Jim.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right, right. No, I hear you. And then on the just not to beat a dead horse on the SLR, I just
want to make sure I understand this. Sequentially, it seems like it didn't, if I look at it the right way, it doesn't feel like
you've got a lot of benefit on the SLR from the reduced balance sheet. Is that a fair way to think about it? Is it just sort
of a timing thing because it's under the SLR guidelines it's average, and you did most of that towards the end of the
quarter? Or should we see more to go on the SLR in the next quarter? Or just trying to run the math. It doesn't feel like
there was a lot of benefit on the balance sheet reduction in SLR.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: There were certainly benefits. The big things that factor into the SLR are...
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Obviously derivatives.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Correct. And so when I say that we haven't taken any steps to comply with those rules,
we're going to wait till we see the final rules on that before we really begin to address that. That it really has to do with
credit derivatives, and you know the way the various maturities are treated.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. And you haven't really done much there in terms of whether it's compression created,
things like that, yet, as you await the final rules.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Is that sort of the take away?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So compression trades have obviously picked up over the last call it year or so within the
industry, but again, in terms of addressing that item, we really want to see the final rule before we take any steps.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. So there still could be more to come there. And then on...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I would expect that.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Yeah. And then lastly on CCAR, you still think it's 10 basis points to 15 basis points? Or
have you refined that at all in terms of the benefit? Because again some your peers have been more aggressive in saying
it would help them more significantly.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, I didn't include that in the numbers today. We're not – it's not a 100% clear to us
that in the final rule CCAR is going to be a component.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's no different than it was. I did mention on the last call, but...
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: 10 basis points to 15 basis points.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: ...again, I don't think we should necessarily – we don't want to count things that aren't
necessarily we think in the final rule. So we're just giving you kind of the mark-to-market on this today. And then we
can give you the adjustments because we know that other capital has to come out of the funds.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right.

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So those are things that we know. But if does come to fruition it's 10 basis points or 15
basis points also.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. Okay. And then just switching gears just the last question, in Asset Management it
seems like the performances has definitely picked up. You've had good flows particularly in Fixed Income and Equities
is doing better as well. But alternative seem to be still be choppy even though there's been industry-wide good flows, is
that just still struggling performance there? Or just the type of funds you're offering? How do we think about – how
should we think about flows improving on the alternative side?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So when you – so our alternative performance has been strong also. What you're seeing is
the mix of the harvesting.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Versus areas like fund-to-funds and Dane and his team can give you a breakdown on sort
of how those flows, but you'd see the growth there also.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. So it's more of the harvesting.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Correct.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Good morning. I'm just curious, if you can say, I mean $56 billion isn't a lot in assets, and
if you view them as CCAR onerous, surely every other financial institution in the world also views them as CCAR
onerous. So just curious, who took your side of the trade or I mean is it non-bank financials? Is it funds? Is it – or is it
just that it's a complete tear up and those positions don't exist in the marketplace anymore?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, it's a good question. So obviously, we have no visibility into our competitor
strategies or certainly how they're thinking about CCAR. I think that a lot's been written about the repo markets.
Certainly our $25 billion reduction in the matchbook had no marginal impact in terms of the repo markets, but I think
this will be interesting to watch how it evolves, because as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple constraints.
Each bank will address their constraints, and they think it's the way that's most impactful for their clients. That's how
we approached it. And so we'll have to see how it evolves in terms of ultimately if all firms adopted this strategy what
impact that has on liquidity and how liquidity gets provided. But it's very early in that.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yeah. All right. Thank you.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So a quick one first on the market piece, I think you had told Glenn it flowed through I&L,
but can you give us a sense of how much the Equities revenues were impacted by the gains from that transaction?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I'm happy to tell you. It was roughly $50 million in terms of markets contribution.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Terrific. Thanks. And then and so far as the non-comp just following up on Fiona's question,
was there any impact from the sale of the Reinsurance business from last year so like when we look at 2013 versus
2014 how much should we think about dropping out of non-comp from the sale of businesses, and then if you could
also maybe give us a sense of variable and fixed in that line, might be helpful.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: You can see in insurance line and the expense base, and then if you check the earnings
release, I think we have the detail there. But the reinsurance revenues for the first half of last year were roughly $315
million, I think $317 million to be specific. But we can give you the full number. But Dane can follow up with you on
the insurance reserves that come out. When you actually look at it six months to six months, year-over-year, when you
look at that sale, basically revenues are pretty much flat year-to-year. We replaced that with obviously other activity in
the franchise.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Yeah. No, I'm sorry, I was asking about the non-comp side on the expense side but okay.
And then the last one quickly is Security Services. So you guys are tracking to be up a bit here on last year, but pretty
well below still prior years. And so I was just kind of curious as to what might be driving that sort of moderate bounce
back giving the markets at peak levels and some competitors highlighting some strength in that business.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So in terms of our Prime services business, that franchise feels incredibly strong to us in
terms of its differentiating characteristics. In terms of performance, that will be driven by a number of factors, balances,
the degree to which market participants are short and borrow stock, and so I think it just really reflects the current
environment.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So you think it's far more cyclical and not anything specific to the franchise or any changes
that you guys have made?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, definitely not. Definitely nothing in the franchise. As I said, the franchise feels quite
good. Part of that business is about lending stock into short positions and sourcing short positions and in this kind of
marketplace where it's been steadily rising and you have lower conviction, you don't see as much of that performance.
But the franchise feels quite good.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for the color, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Just a couple of quick ones from me. Just in terms of the, it looks like the pace of
buybacks increased a little bit this quarter. Perhaps that was the second quarter phenomenon coming out of the CCAR
approval. But I'm just curious as to how you all are thinking about potential buybacks through the course of the year
given that you've got a pretty sizable, about five quarters of buybacks available at this point.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right. So we did $1.25 billion, as I mentioned, in the quarter. And so again, one of the
things in terms of the way we approach the capital planning is we really don't want our folks and our investors to think
of stock repurchase as a dividend. So one of the things we don't do is we don't announce our stock repurchase capacity
at the beginning of the year, because we treat it dynamically, it'll be environment driven. In this particular part of the

environment where you see our capital ratios are very high, we just felt like we're in a position to return that capital,
and that'll be our philosophy going forward.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And then just a question on the operating risk RWA, I think you mentioned last
quarter that, that was about $90 billion. I guess I'm curious as to whether or not that's changed at all given some of the
litigation issues that have set other companies and obviously you all had a little bit of litigation running through the
P&L as well.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, so when we came off the Basel III parallel run, we didn't, we weren't asked to
make any significant adjustments to op risk capital, it hasn't moved materially quarter-over-quarter. But we'll continue
to assess it in the extent to which we have isolated events and we take reserves, it'll impact accordingly.

Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas Sipkin>: Yeah, thank you, and good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey. Good morning.
<Q - Douglas Sipkin>: Just wanted to drill down a little bit on fixed income both primary and secondary. First, I
guess, so we have the Fed finally announcing they plan to be done with buying I believe in October. I mean, anyone
inside of the organization thinking that could be a little bit of a catalyst for FICC, particularly volatility and treasuries
or is it still really more based on just overall market environment? Because you just continue to feel like them in the
market has been a hindrance for other levels of activity.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, I think if you were to look back a year ago, and I think it was May 22 in 2013, the
initial announcements of tapering came out. I think, look, I think you have to consider it a pretty extraordinary success
in terms of the way the Federal Reserve has navigated that announcement in the process and the way the market has
responded to it. There was obviously some initial volatility because of – on some uncertainty what tapering means.
Our sense is that it's been executed quite well. The market understands it, the communication has been good, and so in
a sense, I don't want to say anything's always fully baked in but I think the market has adjusted to the notion of
tapering, and so there's not a lot of new information in it for the market to adjust to. Now, of course, that's always in the
context of what's happening in the global economy and political events and everything else, and so there's always other
factors, but I think narrowly defined, I think we call tapering a success.
<Q - Douglas Sipkin>: But just expanding on that, I mean, just the fact that potentially, they were maybe crowding out
players in the market and to the extent that doesn't exist anymore, you're not seeing that maybe as a little bit of a boost
to the business post-October or as we get closer to the deadline where they're done?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's a factor, there a number of factors. I think sentiment, global growth, what happens
with volatilities and trends are bigger, but it's always a – it certainly is a factor.
<Q - Douglas Sipkin>: Okay, great. And then just second question, obviously, the banking continues to be very strong.
The debt origination continues to be very resilient. It looks like Europe and maybe some of the high-yield markets in
Europe have been really good this year, and I'm just wondering for the longest time people would talk about the
potential disintermediation of the European lending market versus the bond market being a driver for your industry. I
mean, is that something we're starting to see a little bit more of now with some of the constraints on the banking sector
there that the bond market's picking up? Can you maybe elaborate a little on that, because it did look like European
credit, particularly high-yield was really good for the industry this quarter?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So obviously, we've had a long commitment to our European business, and as they work
through the geographic regions associated with their part of the crisis, certainly we've seen opportunities to work very
closely with clients. I think the shift from, as we would call it and you would call it, bank-related financing to debt
capital markets is something that's underway. But that's certainly I think a long-term trend, and so we'll see it evolve
over many years. Now where you have seen, obviously, is a huge amount of immediately picked up activity across
Europe was basically in the equity capital markets. We obviously ranked number one there, but the amount of capital
raised was pretty extraordinary in the quarter, over $180 billion, 600 deals in the first half of the year alone. And so
there's a lot of activity in Europe.

Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi. Good morning, Harvey. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to just
follow up on your comments on the VaR. I'm just trying to reconcile the continued compression across volatility in
most products as well as some of the balance sheet reductions. And yet it would seem that some of the more, well,
basically all of the FICC products didn't seem to show too much movement, so I'm just trying to understand the
dynamics.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as I mentioned, quarter-over-quarter, the bigger mover was in Equities, and that was a
combination of volatility and risk coming down. When you look across it, most of the movement in the quarter, when
you look across the various asset classes was more volatility driven, again, corresponding with the extremely low [ph]
vol (80:00) levels that we've talked about.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And the – so the balance sheet actions I guess didn't have much of a role, and I guess, is that
reflected then in the limited changes around RWAs? Just...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, so again, this is this important distinction between those regulatory measures that
deal with things that are risk-based, like the Basel III rules, and those things that are not risk-based or not as much
risk-based, like leverage tests. And so this was really, as I said, not risk-based parts of the balance sheet, lower ROA
portions of the balance sheet like the matchbook.

could be deployed into the other businesses? When you submitted last year's CCAR, you were at like a 9.2% under the
Basel III standardized. Is that the right way to think about the floor on the capital ratios that you would target to
manage the business?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as we've talked about in the past, we have a target of 9.5%. We're running at a – on a
11.4% level. So clearly, we feel like we have more than enough capital capacity to deploy that capital. And so we feel
like we have a lot of flexibility at this stage to respond to our clients' needs. In terms of future CCAR tests, we'll see
how they go.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: But would that target move lower now, now that you're doing these balance sheet
actions?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's something we'll look at. It's possible. I certainly don't see it moving any higher.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Thanks. Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Hi. Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. So first, with respect to the comments on
competitive positioning, debt underwriting, you highlighted it was a good market, but you guys have also been moving
up the league tables, quite a bit there both within investment grade and high-yield, and so that's also showing up within
results. So would you attribute that to something that Goldman is doing specifically in those businesses, just given
maybe better economics? Or are peers becoming less competitive which is creating openings? Just trying to get some
perspective there. And then with respect to deal financing, it doesn't sound like that there's any issues that you're seeing.
But do you expect any impact just from greater regulatory pressure on the more highly levered deals?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So in terms of our position, obviously we've been participating in some large significant
transactions, and the more that you see, the more you see financing driven by advisory activity and merger activity,
given our role in that marketplace, you'd expect us to be more significantly involved. Now, obviously the debt business
has been a very important business to Goldman Sachs for a number of years. Historically, we haven't been the most
aggressive lender, certainly. We haven't thought the risk return in terms of that activity, but in the most important
transactions where content and execution are at a premium, we've done a pretty good job of staying involved, we won't
always be but we've done a pretty good job. In terms of the, I think you're talking specifically about the leverage
finance rules.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Correct.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Again, a bit of a work in progress. Obviously, a very significant focus for the regulators.
I think this is one of these things where the market over time will find its way in terms of those clients that want to use
significant leverage. But at this stage I think the whole market in the industry is sort of adjusting and working its way
through. I think at this stage it hasn't, it certainly hasn't impacted people's ability to get transactions done in the way
they want to get them done.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. I appreciate the color. And then just secondly, just maybe coming at the balance sheet
topic again, and really appreciate all the detail in the prior questions. But when thinking about the mechanics of the
ROE and what's going to drive it higher over time, just from a really simplistic perspective, profit margins are already
back to where they were in 2007. And so it sounds like improving asset productivity is going be the primary

contributor, but when you look at the mix of businesses today at the firm, is there anything that has changed where you
feel like there should be further upside in profit margins from where we were during the prior cycle?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as we talked about we feel like we have significant operating leverage from here.
Maybe the best way to characterize that is a bit of a blunt metric. But if you look at our compensation ratio, call it,
post-crisis versus pre-crisis, it's been averaging 900 basis points lower. And so, it's a pretty significant change in the
cost structure of the firm in terms of the steps that we've taken. And yet when you – and I think this is really important
to underscore, when you look at our results and you look at our relative position in M&A or as mentioned in the debt
activity or certainly in equity or our performance in Institutional Client Services or the growth in Asset Management,
we've been able to achieve all that simultaneously.
And that's with certain of our businesses, particularly Equities and Fixed Income really in a low [ph] vol (85:51) kind
of a headwind oriented environment. And so, if we went through a period where we saw revenue tailwinds, we feel like
we're well positioned in terms of our clients and the franchise, and certainly there's meaningful upside in terms of
operating leverage.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay, great. Appreciate the color.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Devin.

Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Société Générale. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry to flog a dead horse, but [ph] there's
some more (86:25) questions on the SLR. I mean, do you have particular targets in mind going towards 2014 or indeed
towards the 2015 CCAR for SLR you envisage?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So certainly no targets yet. We want to see again the final rule. And again, I think the
regulators have done a very thoughtful thing here in terms of the compliance given there's a multi-year compliance
glide path, if you will, to 2018. We haven't set a target yet. But when we see the final rule, we'll work with it, like we
have all the other rules, and then we'll eventually have a target that we'll manage to.
As I said earlier, without really taking significant steps right now, when you add up all the math, prefer the balance
sheet exercise and obviously the capital that will come out from the significant financial institutions deduction, we see
ourselves achieving something that's in excess of 5%, but there's no targets that yet.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Right. I see. And in terms of managing that SLR, I mean, can you state explicitly whether you
can issue more preferred stock over and above that 150-basis point limit RWAs for the purposes of contributing to the
numerator on your SLR?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I think we have the flexibility. I don't know necessarily that again, we'll see the final
rule. I don't know necessarily whether it would be our preferred, to use that language, our preferred approach in terms
of complying with the rule.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: So it's not your preferred approach, but you can do if you wanted to. Is that correct?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I believe we have the capacity. But again, that's, that would be also something that any
firm would have to work through with their CCAR plans, et cetera, right? We're just talking about capital management
outside of CCAR, right, so we're being very specific on it.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Okay. Okay. And then, sorry, how much could you reduce your balance sheet by if you reduced
your compression traits to your SLA?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I don't know the number off the top my head. Sorry.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Right. Okay, and then very lastly, I'm just thinking about catalyst to turn around the weak trading
environment. Obviously, we're living in a world of very low volatility. I think yourselves and another banks talk about
a subdued economic environment that's causing this low volatility, but to my mind it's not really that bad. Global
economic growth is still positive, especially in the U.S. and the U.K. I mean, what do we really need to get a
turnaround in volatility in trading volumes? Are we missing other catalysts here to fall into place?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So in the end it's going to be economic growth. And look, I agree with you, we've come
up at very low level in terms of economic growth and it's positive, but economic growth in the long term is really
what's going to drive sentiment, and sentiment will drive activity, and not all businesses participate in sentiment in the
same way. Again, we've seen a big sentiment shift year-over-year in terms of the way CEOs are thinking about merger
and advisory activity. It's hard to tell when that sentiment shift will change in terms of driving more position changes in
terms of the way people think about their portfolios. But we'll see.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: All right. Okay. Well, thank you very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Andrew, thank you.
