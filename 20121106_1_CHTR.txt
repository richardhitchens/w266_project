MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Keisha and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Charter Communications Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute
to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] Thank you.
I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Gutzler. Ma'am, you may begin.
Robin Gutzler
Thank you, Keisha. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Charter's 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Call. This morning,
we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern time detailing our results.
Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors
and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.
Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's
current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional

During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies.
In today's earnings release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP, as well as pro forma results for 2011. The
pro forma results reflect the acquisition of certain cable systems in 2011 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2011,
unless otherwise noted. The year-over-year growth rates we will be referring to this morning are on a pro forma basis.
Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. The presentation that
accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under Financial Information. The press release
and trending schedules are also posted on our website under Investor & News Center.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thank you, Robin. In the third quarter, we made solid progress in implementing our key strategic changes, and our
overall results are in line with our expectations. We grew residential customer relationships by 19,000 during the
quarter, compared to a loss the last several years. We increased primary subscriber units by 48,000 and we generated
3.75% revenue growth. As expected, EBITDA was impacted by the transition to our new operating strategies.
Our adjusted EBITDA was effectively flat year-over-year. We also accelerated capital investment to $488 million in
the quarter, reflecting the significant growth opportunity in front of us and the need to create an initial working
inventory of CPE.
Before we go further into details about our financial results for the quarter, I'd like to give you an update on how we're
changing the way we do business. My goal is to generate more cash flow per home passed and long-term shareholder
returns. I started in February and I'm confident that Charter has all the necessary pieces in place, but we're making
some changes to the operating model. We've revamped our product, changed our offer structure and changed our
selling structure. We're going all-digital to offer a competitive product, reclaim bandwidth and secure our plan. And
we're organizing our operations, including the bulk of operating responsibilities at Charter, all of which is intended to
give a clear line of ownership, authority and accountability for every aspect of the customer experience.
For example, by centralizing network operations, we'll be able to centrally manage our infrastructure, allowing us to
move more quickly to implement product changes uniformly across the network and maintain consistent service
quality.
Now, we have a centralized marketing and sales organization truly focused on bringing in long-term and profitable new
customers. Our regional teams will focus on operations, including installation, service and maintaining quality outside
plant and they'll focus exclusively on doing these critical responsibilities well.
These are just some of the examples of recent changes, and they will take time to fully implement and have the
intended effect, but we have the team in place to do it and we're making meaningful headway.
We've also launched new pricing and packaging as we entered the third quarter. We simplified and standardized our
offering for both our customers and sales agents. In video, we made the product competitive by increasing our HD
offering and providing the right box on the right TV set in each transaction. We also simplified our Internet offering in
two tiers and increased our base Internet speed to 30 megabits, which is 10 times faster than the typical DSL speed and
faster than U-Verse can currently go. We've priced our lead Triple Play offer, which includes a fully featured phone
offering, in a way that includes more value than our customers can get elsewhere.
In addition, we changed how we go to market with this superior offering by modifying our channel mix and messaging
and changing our sales compensation plans to drive the desired selling activities.

The key objectives of our new offering are to, one, drive deeper penetration of our services into the home with a simple
compelling offer structure. Secondly, to drive higher ARPU per connect, which will increase over time with built-in
multiyear price steps. Third, our transaction costs per customer will be lowered. And, finally, we'll extend the life of
our customers through lower churn. All of these objectives are designed to increase operating cash flow and drive
return on investment.
At this point, we're where we expected to be and I'm pleased with some of the early stats. For example, we've seen our
Triple Play percentage of new connects increase by 70%. And as of the end of the quarter, 17% of our base is now on
our new pricing and packaging, which in a single quarter is ahead of where we expected to be.
Through new customer acquisition and migration of legacy customers, we're seeding the market with a better video
product, with an upfront capital investment, which pays for itself immediately or after a promotional period. That
improvement in video doesn't immediately show when you only look at growth, video growth in the third quarter.
Our expanded basic subscriber losses actually improved by 30,000 year-over-year, because we're only actively
marketing expanded basic. We lost 17,000 expanded basic customers in Q3 2012 versus losing 47,000 in the same
quarter last year. We've added a graph on slide four of the presentation posted this morning which shows how previous
selling of reception basic, mask the underlying improvement.
While the big opportunity for Charter remains in our core operations, our offerings and the service we provide, we
continue to develop new products in parallel. That includes delivering content on devices inside and outside the home,
improving user interfaces. both on legacy and on new devices, and creating the capabilities to control, modify, and
deliver those interfaces from the cloud.
We'll have more to announce on product developments as they're ready for broader rollout. We're developing those
product improvements in the context of buying set-top boxes at significantly lower prices, which we can use to grow
Charter. And, we intend to progressively move to an all-digital platform over the next two years starting with seeding
the market with boxes today, turning off analog channels to reclaim bandwidth and eventually switching off inferior
analog product altogether.
So, we're making improvements across the organization and changing the way we do business. There is a lot of change
and I'm pleased with the way our employees have responded. Ultimately, we'll be a highly effective service
organization with a superior product offering and we're taking actions designed to deliver meaningful value to
customers and superior return on investment to our shareholders.
And before I turn the call over to Chris, to cover the third quarter in more detail, I'd like to highlight that our
commercial services continue to do well. We grew revenue by more than 20% year-on-year for the sixth consecutive
quarter, demonstrating strength in this business. We continue to see a big opportunity in front of us here.
And now, Chris Winfrey.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results are tracking with the strategy Tom just laid out.
Adjusted EBITDA declined slightly and CapEx increased as a function of the plans we're implementing.
Looking at residential volume and revenue per customer on slide four, customer relationships increased 19,000,
compared to a loss of 10,000 in Q3 of Q3 of 2011. In PSU terms, we grew by 48,000 in the third quarter compared to
virtually nil a year ago. While video losses were 10,000 higher than prior year our expanded basic trend improved with
limited basic customers representing over three-quarters of the decline this year, compared to 25% in the prior year.
We added 69,000 Internet customers, compared to 53,000 last year. And phone PSUs, the most visible beneficiary of
our new pricing and packaging, increased by 52,000 in Q3, nearly five times the gain of 11,000 in the year-ago quarter,
all of which was expected given the changes we're making.

Total revenue per residential customer relationship was $105.39 in the quarter, down from Q2 ARPU of $106. The
overall ARPU reflected entry-level pricing and, despite a meaningful increase in Triple Play sell-in, still reflects
continued sales of single play Internet.
So those are the early statistics, but there's more to the numbers. We no longer actively market analog, we also saw a
temporary drop in direct sales as we retooled that channel. We acquired customers who are more profitable, with a
deeper product and CPE penetration, which will lower future transaction costs and propensity to churn.
Triple-play increased by 70% to 26% of new connects in Q3 at an entry-level ARPU of approximately $120. And we
moved a portion of our existing base up the value chain to make existing relationships more profitable.
So the revenue benefit is not yet in the financials and won't be for a few quarters. What we do expect to highlight in the
coming quarters are ARPU per residential customer, not product ARPU, the percentage of customers taking bundled
products, particularly Triple Play, and early on the portion of our customer base in the new pricing and packaging with
a richer, fuller offering, which will result in fewer transactions and lower churn, as Tom mentioned, already at 17% of
our base.
Turning to slide five in the presentation, third quarter revenue grew 3.7% year-on-year. Video revenues declined 0.5%
due to a decrease in residential basic video customers year-on-year, partially offset by price increases and higher DVR
and HD revenues.
Internet revenues rose 7.6%, driven by the addition of more than 300,000 customers over the past year. And, phone
revenues were down 3.7%, despite the 6.5% customer gain in the past 12 months, somewhat irrelevant going forward
due to Triple Play revenue allocation, which is why we'll stop reporting product ARPUs after Q4 and why we're
providing some additional color on bundling splits. And don't forget we're selling in at promotional rates today, with
lower one-time fees, including install of the new pricing and packaging.
Adjusted EBITDA was down $3 million year-over-year, but before I go through the expense drivers, I want to tie the
PSU and revenue development to our growth investments. As shown on slide six, third quarter capital expenditures
totaled $488 million, an increase of $184 million versus the year ago quarter, driven by higher CPE, support capital and
commercial spend.
We spent over half our capital or $255 million on CPE in the quarter, essentially split into four buckets of spend.
Nearly 40% of the spend in the CPE category during Q3 was capitalized new install labor for residential and
commercial, which is included in the NCTA CPE category. We also built CPE inventory, which accounted for
approximately 30% of the $255 million to ensure adequate stocking levels to execute on our new strategies. We can
think of these dollars as really one-time working capital and declining.
We also invested in CPE for new customer acquisition and upgrades to existing customers and this accounted for
roughly 15% of the quarterly CPE spent. And finally, we're installing more CPE into our existing video customers'
homes, as they migrate to our new pricing and packaging and take a richer video product from us, which accounted for
the remaining roughly 15% of the CPE expenditure.
So the link I'm really trying to make here is to show why that current CPE spend isn't immediately flowing to revenue.
All of the CPE spend in each type of box deployment has a clear ROI attached to it, even at promotional rates. And I'm
confident that you'll see that spend flow through to revenue and cash flow, and we'll show you that development over
time.
To round out capital expenditures in addition to higher CPE, we increased capital to grow commercial, reflected
primarily in scalable infrastructure and line extensions in our CapEx categories, and we increased the commercial to
$82 million in the third quarter or $34 million more than last year. And support capital expenditure also increased, due
to fleet replacement, which is primarily timing related.
Our current estimate for 2012 CapEx is $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. We expect to be on a different part of the
investment curve than our peers for the next few years and we think our growth can be more efficient, given the
significant reductions in CPE pricing.

Now back to adjusted EBITDA on slide seven. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.5% year-on-year, as revenue growth of
3.7% was offset by increased expenses. Total operating costs increased 6% and the key cost drivers were programming,
which rose $27 million or 5.7%, and we increased labor costs for preventative maintenance to identify potential failure
points in advance, and improve customer service.
And while we expect marketing, reconnect and preventative maintenance to continue at elevated levels for some time,
this is all discretionary spend and it's designed to drive revenue, better service, improved retention, and ultimately
higher cash flow per home passed. So our collective investments, including capital expenditure, are shown on slide
eight, where free cash flow was negative $17 million in Q3.
From a balance sheet perspective, we had $715 million of liquidity at September 30, being pro forma for announced
transactions. And during the quarter, we continued to be active in the debt markets, balancing our maturity profile and
bringing down our weighted average cost of interest.
In the quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of 5 1/4 senior unsecured notes in August and we announced the redemption of
$678 million of CCH II 13.5% notes, which we completed on October 10. We've initiated a call for the remaining $468
million outstanding in November. Pro forma before retiring those 13.5% notes, our weighted average interest rate will
be 5.9% and our cash interest run rate will be just under $770 million, down some $175 million from just the third
quarter of 2011.
So most of the heavy lifting on the capital structure is complete, but we'll continue to be opportunistic in extending and
balancing our maturity profiles as opportunities arise. We ended the quarter with pro forma leverage of 4.8 times,
which is above our target leverage range of 4.0 to 4.5 times. As I said before, we can be plus or minus a half-turn either
way to be opportunistic, as we were with buybacks last year, which enabled strategic activity, including the current
investment levels to position Charter for growth. I'm very comfortable with our current leverage, liquidity and our
maturity profiles.
And now, back to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thanks, Chris. So, in closing, we're pleased with our progress and the results at this stage of implementation. There's
more work to be done, but we're energized by the opportunity to drive long-term growth at Charter.
Operator, let's open the call for questions, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: -- on CapEx, I think, the market's sort of aware of the guidance, the $1.6 billion to $1.7
billion, but I think that some of the commentary you gave today may have been new to the market, sort of the – sort of
higher CapEx I think you said over the next few years. But I was just wondering if you could add a little bit of color
because your – Charter's sort of CapEx to rev ratio has always run sort of a bit above peers. So I didn't know if you
were talking sort of absolute levels or sort of changes as a percent of revenue, relative to where we are in
2012?.Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Jason, we didn't hear the beginning of your question, but I think --
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Oh, I – yeah, I was just on CapEx. So, I think the guidance everyone's aware of the
$1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, but I thought it was new when you said the capital intensity may be on – I think you said – a

different trajectory over the next few years. I was just wondering if you could add some color to that.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah, look, I think the point we're trying to make is that we're elevated today and we
expect to be elevated for some period of time, and that really reflects the growth opportunities that exist at Charter, and
the fact that we'll be going all-digital over the next two years and so that'll be CPE spend. And the good news is that it'll
be CPE spend at a much lower price than where the market has historically bought those boxes. And so, the capital
spend there we have, we expect to be more efficient.
But if you just take a look at the third quarter spend and even on the second quarter spend, you could see the uplift in
CPE, and what we're trying to do today is provide a little bit of color on that as far as what is actually going to labor
that's flows into CPE for NCTA categories. And, importantly, what's actually driving new acquisition and migrations,
which is the 15% and the 15%, respectively. And the one-time inventory build-up that I've talked about both on Q2 as
well as in Q3, and we think we're comfortable now on the stocking level to be able to position the company to deploy
the boxes – box strategy that we have.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: So the right way to think about it is the more successful you are in the top line hitting
your objectives, sort of the longer the elevated CapEx will endure. That's sort of the takeaway.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah, that's right.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: In terms of comparing to peers, it's also a growth story as well. Charter is
underpenetrated, has a bigger growth opportunity, and most of the capital is actually success-based, variable capital,
and so you're right: to the extent that our growth exceeds our peers, our capital'll exceed our peers.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Tom, back when you were at Cablevision, you used to talk a lot about the long-term
capital intensity of cable and I think you talked about the prospect that capital intensity could for that system get below
10%. How do you think about long-term capital intensity at Charter? You've got more headends and a more diffuse
geographic footprint. Do you have a long-term vision for where you think capital intensity can get to?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yes. And I do think that, in general, the cable business becomes more capital efficient
through time. It does not require another plant upgrade, which was always a concern in the industry in terms of capital
intensity. And as – obviously, as digital set-top boxes and CPE in general continue to come down in price, and we have
a strategy of buying CPE from world-class vendors and trying to get our CPE in a position where we can buy them --
buy CPE from multiple providers and, therefore, get competitive pricing, and because of general price trends in general
on electronics, the ability to continue to upgrade the cable system electronically and take its capacity up becomes less
capital intensive through time. The big capital dollars in this business were for the erection of the physical plant.
And so, as our business changes, as it moves toward IP, we can take our business and change our business in a
continuously improving sort of capital intensity profile. And that's – where you are in the curve, in terms of how
penetrated you are and how much growth you have, will affect your capital intensity for variable capital. But the
fundamentals of the business are continuing to improve from a total capital intensity perspective.

<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Just to stay on the theme of capital expenditures and capital intensity. On the one hand it
sounds like you're spending more on CPE for some of the initiatives you've talked about, but at the same time it sounds
like you're saying that you may be able to save on CPE on a per-unit basis, partly perhaps because of more competition
at the equipment provider level. But it also sounds like you may be implying thinner boxes in the home, boxes that
maybe won't have storage, et cetera, which would imply perhaps remote storage DVRs and other functionality in the
cloud. I guess my question is what gives you confidence that at this point or in the near future your network will be
ready to provide a very robust service that could without latency, et cetera, provide the kind of functionality into the
home without a drive in the home that consumers would be pleased with? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Right. Well, I wouldn't say that we have an immediate capability at Charter to go to
network DVR or other cloud-based services like it, which could take what is now a fairly expensive CPE and move it
into a more efficient cloud-based delivery process.
That said, we are already getting better pricing on our set-top boxes going forward and there is an opportunity to
ultimately to get to a thinner environment, but also the price of the current thickness of boxes is coming down, so that
the capital intensity for each dollar of revenue at this part of the curve is actually less than it was a few years ago.
So, that's already being realized, but you can see a world where it continues to improve. For instance, Smart TVs or
iPads with cable television on the iPad is a television and a set-top box embedded in the TV, the iPad itself. So, there's
a case where you can connect cable service, a fully featured cable product, to an iPad and there's no CPE provided by
the cable company. The set-top box is part of the processing power of the device itself, and smart TVs have a similar
capability.
So as we move to a server-based architecture and serve IP devices like iPads and other tablets and Smart TVs, the
capital intensity of each one of those connection, from a cable operator's perspective, goes down. So we're on that part
of the curve and so our growth and our revenue growth per set ought to be lower than those that have been realized
over the past few years by both Charter and all the rest of the industry.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Thanks. You know, switching gears a little bit. Tom, can you talk about the – any interest in
M&A, as you sort of rebuild the core business? It seems like there's a lot going on in the company overall. Is there
room for distractions like mergers or even property swaps at this point? Or is that something that sort of pushes off?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, we're focused on our opportunity, and we have a big opportunity and we have a lot
of unsold passings with – in front of us, and a cable plant in front of them that's fully functional. So that's the big
opportunity in Charter. And so we're not distracted by anything other than the opportunity in front of us.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: And if something were available, is there a level of interest, or?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, we look – our level of interest would be related to the value of the opportunity in
front of us and we'd weigh that if in fact that became available.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Good. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Chris, I wanted to ask you two questions, one about ARPU and the other on just the
CapEx accounting, if you could clarify for us. I think you mentioned ARPU per new Triple Play connect at $120 and
ARPU per customer relationship was sort of flat year-on-year. I know there's a lot of moving pieces on ARPU right
now. There were a couple of things you guys talked about last call, like home networking, I think installation fees. Just
if could you help kind of give us the puts and takes on ARPU in the quarter? And then how we sort of bridge from the
current number to the kind of new connect number over time? And then I just have a quick CapEx question, is there
any difference between cash and accrual capital as you build this inventory? In other words, how tied is the CapEx on a
quarterly basis to what's actually happening, from an installation perspective? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah, so maybe I'll take the second one first. Under U.S. GAAP for cable companies
under the pronouncements that exist, capital – what I would normally call working capital for inventory for CPE is
capitalized up front. And so it does create a difference between how that capital was used and deployed versus how it's
accounted for. And so the purpose of what I was doing in the prepared remarks today was to identify that portion which
is really a working capital item, which is building up your inventory and your supply chain in a way that you can
deploy more boxes per transaction because we did that in Q2 and Q3.
In a normalized environment – and the reason you wouldn't have heard too much about this in the past – is in a
normalized environment, it's normally a bit of a wash, little bit one quarter and out the next. But in this environment,
where we're stocking the entire supply system to be able to deploy that many more boxes, it's relevant in when you
think about CPE. So, it is one-time and you'll see some fluctuations on it. I think we've gotten the large amounts of it
behind us.
Under IFRS or other accounting standards, that's not the case and you could actually reflect CapEx as it was deployed.
And what I was describing would be working capital, and that's why I kind of referred to it as working capital.
On ARPU – so that's the technical accounting of the day – on ARPU, the waterfall is long at what you're trying to do,
so I'm going to avoid getting into all of that and try to keep it fairly simple. You have a few different levers that are
taking place. One is that our Triple Play is year-one promotional pricing and it's coming in at an average of $120,
which will step up over time, as will all of the different bundles that we're selling into today.
So you have a promotional rate and you have a higher amount of sales going in at that higher-than-average ARPU
today, albeit at a promotional rate for Triple Play. You have the lower amount of install, one-time fees. You have still a
strong single play Internet sell-in that's taking place and that forms part of the mix there as well. And net-net for all
those puts and takes even at promotional pricing, we're relatively flat year-over-year, with a much improved customer
base in terms of the product set that they have, and a position to be able to step up in rate over time.
And so, I think, if we're able to do that, despite the promotional rates and the fact that we're putting more Triple Play
and putting more boxes into the home, we're actually in a very good position both from a revenue standpoint, as well as
an OpEx standpoint, and from a capital efficiency, through lower churn over time. That's – without going line by line,
that's really the right way to think about ARPU.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: [ph] Steve (31:14) covered the CapEx questions, unfortunately, so I think I'll turn to
competition and EBITDA margins. Tom, are you seeing anything notable from competitors at this stage, especially
post implementing your expansive changes and would something like faster U-verse speeds be a concern, for example?
I imagine AT&T will make some noise Wednesday at their Analyst Day, and then I've got a question for Chris.

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, we haven't actually seen any change in the competitive environment. Cablevision
has a pretty – Charter has a footprint that has about 33% overlap with a competitive telco. So the vast majority of our
footprint is competitive against satellite and DSL. And we're superior in almost our entire footprint. When we're up
against FiOS, we have a – I'd say a comparable product. But when we're against AT&T in the U-verse area, we have a
superior product and when we're against satellite and DSL, we have a superior product. Yes, if they take their speeds
up, it will be a more competitive environment, but we have the ability to go much faster and farther than we've already
gone, with very little additional capital investment.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: And then for Chris, I know lot of changes are taking place, but if operating execution is
successful, it would seem Charter would shift from an initial investment phase where margins compress to a faster
growth phase where margins expand. So is that correct, do you think – do you see the potential for Charter to put up
margin expansion at some point in the future? And at what point should investors start to model that in? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So I think the – when you think about EBITDA margin, it's really – the answer to
your question would be, when the growth starts to slow. The faster you grow, the more pressure there is on the
EBITDA margin as a percentage. You're spending more on sales and marketing, reconnect all the different areas that
are driving that growth. And so, while you're growing and particularly when you're growing faster you'll see
compression on EBITDA margin. So I think the – not to turn the question back, but I will, which is – when do you
think the growth will slow? And that's when you see – you should start to see margins return to a normal rate.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: So the [ph] flash (33:35) is correct, but the hope is they don't grow for a long time, right?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: [indiscernible] (33:40)
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: That's right.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: If you have – as long as you have an accelerating growth rate.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Right, all right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Yeah, we're – so, you're giving – obviously, putting more investment in the network. Can
you frame this sort of in terms of historical cable? It seems like the -the Street seems to believe if you talk to investors
you're just a little bit stuck sort of a few years behind some of the peers. At what point can this CapEx push kind of put
you on parity? Or put you ahead? And then, specifically to the commercial side, what are your thoughts on any needs
for additional maybe cloud-based products or so forth? Is that something you're looking to build or possibly see a
tuck-in acquisition?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Tom, do you want to answer the commercial question first.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Sure, I'll answer the commercial side of that question. Regarding cloud-based services,
we see plenty of opportunity with the base services we now offer through all segments. We are very underpenetrated in
the business market. Now, I believe a number of years out as our penetration increases and we want to continue to grow
at a healthy rates that we'll need some of these supplemental services. And we offer some of the basic cloud services
today, but I think our current product portfolio is very adequate, given our penetration level and the opportunity ahead
of us right now.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And with – Frank, with regard to your question about capital in general and where we
stand, as I was saying earlier, a lot – most of our capital going forward is related to our opportunity to grow. And to the

extent that we grow faster than other parts of the industry, we would have more capital relative to revenue than other
companies that were growing less rapidly.
That said, because Charter is historically underpenetrated based on its history, and it has a big growth opportunity in
front of it, to the extent that it achieves its growth objectives, each dollar of growth will be served with less capital than
has already been invested previously by other companies, because the curve in terms of cost per CPE unit continues to
go down, the price curve. And so, we're getting both more advanced technology and lower prices in the kinds of CPE
we're buying for the growth that we're presenting in front of us. And so, in that sense, we're more capital efficient for
dollar generated of revenue going forward than has historically been achieved in the industry. But to the extent we have
more growth in the industry we're going to have more capital.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: So, in terms of kind of when investors can see that you've kind reach the end game there, do
you look at certain industry benchmark penetration levels of products and when you get there we should expect that to
slow down a little bit? Or where are you? Is it a two-year gap relative to the industry? 18-month gap? Three-year gap,
something like that?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, the best-performing company in the industry generates about $450 of cash flow
EBITDA per home passed and Charter is the worst-performing company in the industry with about $225 of EBITDA
per home passed. So, that opportunity, that $225, the doubling of our EBITDA in total would catch us up to the
best-performing company in the industry.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe.
<Q - James Maxwell Ratcliffe>: -- question. Looking at ARPU again, you said 17% of the subscriber base at the end
of the quarter was on the new package, pricing package structure. How are they getting there? I mean, how many of
those are customers who are new to the system and then basically they're coming on to the new plans versus existing
customers for either proactively migrating or for retention being migrated? And how do we think about the
apples-to-apples what the pricing for an existing customer who's moving over looks like, if there's any step down on
that? Or if you still move through the back book? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah, I'm not sure I'm going to break out all of those pieces for you, but it's all of the
above. We're acquiring new customers. We're migrating customers. But, generally our pricing strategy is to step up
existing customers when they move into price and packaging and not price them down, and to price in new acquisition
subscribers at higher prices than we historically sold them in that.
We are modifying our installation prices and – which are one-time charges and they are reflected in some of the
revenue growth and ARPU numbers that you see. But in terms of the monthly recurring price, except for a few
exceptions which are minor relatively speaking, our objective is to price higher. Now, the way we do that is add more
value. The product is worth more. It has a lot more TV channels on the video product, they're in HD, there's two-way
interactivity as part of the service offering, the video – the data speeds have gone dramatically to 30 megabits at
minimum, and the voice speech or the voice service is more fully featured than it was previously. So, the full package
is worth more and we charge more for it.
<Q - James Maxwell Ratcliffe>: And if I could have one other on advertising, I mean, looking historically last
presidential election, you sort of stepped up $6 million, $7 million, 3Q to 4Q, it's more like $10 million in 2010. I
mean, how do we think about that this year, both in terms of your relative exposure to targeted areas? And also your
improvement ability to actually capture the ad spend with more targeted cable ads?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: We have a fairly undeveloped advertising infrastructure in terms of advanced features.
And we have had a very good advertising year in terms of political advertising and it's up dramatically as a result of

political advertising. The future of Charter is such that we have a tremendous opportunity to create targeted advertising
products. And I would say to-date we have hardly any of that in our revenue opportunity or in our actual produced
revenue. So, we're putting some capital – and this is not a very capital intensive part of the business – into that
capability and looking at trying to accelerate non-political growth in advertising through the implementation of
advanced services.

Your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza.
<Q>: -- in for Lance, thanks for taking the question. I have a housekeeping question, was there a timing shift in the
payment of cash interest expense, given the recent refinancing?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yes, and it was significant. The way – the right way to think about this, look, there's
been multiple refinancings, so you can follow up with Robin after the call to go you through maybe a waterfall on that
because it's all publicly inside of the Q. But there have been multiple refinancings. Each one of those have had different
payment date terms. There is a significant difference, not only in effective rate that we had inside the quarter, but also
in the timing of payments, all of which you can get off the maturity schedule that we had at each quarter.
But the right way to think about this is what I mentioned in the prepared remarks is that our interest expense is reduced
dramatically. It's down into the $770 million range or just below that, including all swap costs LCDs [inaudible]
(42:30) interest expense. And the interest rate is 5.9% now pro forma for the transactions. And then, the schedule that
you have inside of the presentation, if you look in the back of the presentation, you can actually map out how those
payments will be taking place in the future.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you for that. I'll look into it. The other question I had was regarding, so on the phone and the
Internet side, it looks like you're adding subscribers while sacrificing on price, could you comment on that? And then,
finally, the last part of the question is on video, how much pricing did you take in the quarter? And how do you see the
pricing environment going forward? Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So, we didn't have a video rate increase in the quarter and product ARPU for phone,
given that result being sold inside of a bundle, it's somewhat irrelevant. I mean, the reality is that it's at a discounted
price to achieve a higher total ARPU around the sell-in. You could call it, zero dollars, which is not what we're doing,
but just for sake of argument and that would be meaningless in terms of how you think about the revenue stream for the
company. And so that's why we're focused on total product ARPU.
<Q>: Okay. And then how much pricing on the video side did you take in the quarter? Can you comment on that?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: We did not take rate increases on video inside the quarter.
<A - Robin Gutzler>: And just to be mindful of time, and probably should move to the next question. Thank you.

Yes, ma'am. Your next question is from Amy Yong.
<Q - Amy Yong>: -- video customer gross in the quarter, I think it grew on a sequential basis. I mean, how do you
reconcile that with your bundling efforts? I mean, is this just more high-speed data and phone net-adds? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Hi, Amy. You got cut off at the very beginning of your question, we've been having
that problem on this call. Can you just start that question from the beginning, which got chopped off?
<Q - Amy Yong>: Yeah. Can you just talk a little bit about the non-video customer growth in the quarter? I think it
grew on a sequential basis, so how do you reconcile that against your bundling efforts?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I think that our bundling efforts are making the headway that we hope to at this
time. Charter has an excellent data service and an excellent reputation in the provision of data services. Last year, PC
Magazine found us to be the fastest data service in the country. And so, we continue to do really well in the
marketplace with our data service and it continues to work well. And our challenge with video is that we have not had a
great video service and we've reengineered the whole company in terms of its video product, and now we're in market
with it and it's beginning to, we think, resonate. And our performance year-over-year is better than it was, and we hope
that it continues to get better.

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Given your new strategies and I'm sure there's certain costs that you're undertaking that are
temporary in nature because of training and reshuffling the management structure and so forth, is there any color you
can give us on how much that is and when can that sort of come off to get a better sense of margins going forward?
Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah, I don't – we've got a lot of activity in terms of the way we are organizing the
company, and a lot of those things are in process, and I don't really want to forecast out numerous quarters into the
future, but our business will normalize.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And, Vijay, to the point we were making earlier, the faster you grow, the more you
have investment, both on the CapEx side, as well on the OpEx side as well.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: And given this new growth strategy, any color on return of capital now, given that you probably
will have, obviously, more CapEx and less free cash flow in the shorter term? Is that sort of – is that a push-forward
too? I mean, is there a chance, we could have on return of capital in 2013 of any form? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Look, we're still for this year -- we're still very much positive free cash flow, and
we're at 4.8 times and we're very comfortable with that. The reason that we're at 4.8 times really stems back to two
things. One is that we've done significant buybacks all throughout the course of the last year, but particularly towards
the end of the year. And then the significant amount of refinancing activity that we've had, which has premiums
attached to it to be able to buy down our interest costs with attractive paybacks.
And so those have been the real two drivers when you think about the leverage ratios; it's actually been less about the
CapEx spend because we've been producing positive free cash flow. So the way that we've always thought about return
of capital is, first and foremost, the investment opportunities that are inside the business because they tend to have the
highest ROI.
You can see that flowing through to this year when we've identified those opportunities and starting to execute on
those. And then over time as leverage trends down and free cash flow ticks up – to the extent that's taking place and
when – and you're into your target leverage range, and you'll be looking at all those opportunities, whether it's buying

your own stock or somebody else's through M&A, and if you don't have a better use of capital when you get down to
the bottom of your range or below and you don't have a pending opportunity, you take a look at returning that cash to
shareholders as well. So nothing's really changed on that front. We're just applying one of the ways that we can deploy
capital today in investing inside the business.

Your final question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Hi, thanks. Chris and Tom, I was wondering if you could shed a little light on the sequential
increase in the line called all other operating expense. Is that a temporary increase or is this is a step up that will carry
into subsequent periods? And also, do you think marketing costs now is at the right level or is that something that you
should increase as you aim to grow units faster? Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So, on the other operating costs, we break out into SG&A into operating expenses
inside the MD&A. And you'll see inside that category includes programming, so that's the biggest driver. And then,
particularly labor and to drive some of the reconnect activity that we've been talking about, both in the quarter and
year-to-date basis. And that includes internal and external labor. And then the preventative maintenance as well that
we've highlighted and that's probably the biggest driver year-over-year is the preventative maintenance outside of
programming.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: And with regard to marketing, we've stepped up our marketing and we've actually
reallocated our marketing. And the way we think about marketing dollars is if we can generate a higher response rate
from more marketing, we do it, and if that makes sense from an economic perspective. So we're right now marketing at
the level which we think makes the most economic sense, given the response rate and our ability to handle the response
rate and operate the business.
But it's one of those things that if it works, and you have the ability to modulate your marketing in such a way that you
can drive revenue successfully, then you spend what you need to spend to maximize your return. And that's our
strategy. So we don't just turn it on and off with – in hope that it works or doesn't, nor do we use it to make numbers in
a particular quarter. We look at it as an investment tool, and as then a tool it generates response rates that generate
orders, that generate customers and rates of return and spend accordingly.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Thank you. That's very helpful.
