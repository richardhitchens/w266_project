Well, thank you very much. Welcome to The Priceline Group's second quarter conference call. Thank you for joining
us before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline's Group CFO, Dan
Finnegan.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $13.5 billion, up 34%
year-over-year or about 32% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $667 million, up 31%
year-over-year, and earnings per share was $12.51, up 29% versus prior year surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of
$12.06 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Our customers booked accommodation reservations were 90 million
room nights in the quarter, up 29% year-over-year.
Booking.com's platform now is over 525,000 hotels and other accommodations in 205 countries, up 58% over last year,
reflecting Booking.com's continued aggressive push to extend its lead as the world's largest brand for booking
accommodations. Following the success of Booking.com's first offline advertising campaign in the U.S. last year and
the encouraging early results this year of the campaigns in Australia, the UK and Canada, we launched TV advertising
in Germany a few weeks ago. These offline branding efforts, together with our substantial long-term investments in
online brand building, product innovation and best-in-class customer service, have helped to grow our mix of direct
business. We believe the healthy balance we have between a strong direct business and first-time customers acquired
online are critical to sustain a profitable growth and are helping us increase market share in every market we operate in.
Another area of investment and innovation for Booking.com has been vacation rentals. We are rapidly expanding our
footprint of vacation rentals, and we now have over 190,000 directly bookable self-catered properties. In the last 12
months, our customers spent over $4 billion on vacation rental, that they booked primarily through Booking.com, but
also on our experimental site Villas.com. We are encouraged by these early results, but also recognize there's still much
left to do. We expect to make significant progress in how we grow, merchandise, and expand our vacation rental
offering in the coming months.
Agoda.com was negatively impacted by the civil unrest in Thailand, but nevertheless delivered good transactional
growth in the quarter. Both Agoda.com and Booking.com continued to strengthen the group's position in the Asia
Pacific region, particularly among international travelers.
We are making excellent strides in North Asia, and Booking.com has become the largest online accommodation service
in Australia. This region in the world continues to contribute to higher overall group growth, as it increases its share of
our worldwide business.
Priceline.com posted solid 21% growth in gross bookings with strong results in its retail offerings. The Name Your
Own Price business, however, continues to be under pressure, given the tighter availability conditions present in today's
robust travel environment. Priceline.com's hotel rebuilds, when combined with Booking.com's success in North
America, continued to reflect hotel market share gains.
Rentalcars.com delivered good results in what has become a more competitively intense marketplace. Having
transitioned from an entirely semi-opaque offering to a retail offering, our team is now focusing on striking the right
balance of savings and transparency to deliver the right product at the right time. I have high confidence in our team's
ability to successfully make this transition.
KAYAK again delivered an impressive bottom line quarter, while also accelerating its top line. Targeted expansion in
Europe, with a dedicated offline advertising presence, is yielding favorable results, and we look forward to building the
KAYAK franchise across Europe in an aggressive but profitable manner.
Success on mobile remains critical to all of our brands. Mobile has become a very material and fast growing booking
channel for the group, and we believe we're on the right path of our offering best-in-class experiences without bias to
interface chosen by the customer. We prefer to earn our customers' loyalty over the long term, by exceeding our
expectations time and time again, rather than relying on short-term channel-specific incentives. We view the mobile
opportunity through this lens and are taking a disciplined approach to driving lasting, sustainable customer engagement
with our company's brands.

China is also critical for the future. As we announced last week, the group expanded its relationship with Ctrip, the
largest online travel agency in China. We invested $500 million through a convertible bond and Ctrip granted the group
the right to obtain up to 10% of Ctrip's outstanding stock through a combination of this convertible bond and open
market purchases. The group will also have the right to appoint an observer to the Ctrip board of directors. By getting
closer together, both we and Ctrip, see ways that we can offer our customers, the absolute best choice of
accommodations and experiences. This collaboration will bring more guests to China and more Chinese to the rest of
the world in the coming months, quarters and years. I look forward to executing against this next stage of our
partnership and continuing to learn from and work with James and his leadership team in Shanghai.
Finally, I'd like to welcome the OpenTable team to The Priceline Group. We closed on the acquisition in late July and
have already begun the ground work to realize the global potential we see in this adjacent marketplace. The OpenTable
team meanwhile has been working hard on expanding our mobile payments app, known as pay with OpenTable,
beyond the pilot launch in San Francisco earlier this year. Today, we are announcing that pay with OpenTable is now
launching in New York. We're also confirming our plans to roll it out to 20 other cities across the U.S. before year-end.
Our early results show that everyone wins with pay with OpenTable. The restaurant gets faster table turns, the servers
get better tips, and the guests leave far more satisfied. Since many of you on the call are from San Francisco or New
York, we welcome you to try this experience yourselves. It's really quite satisfying and we believe has great potential.
The group's business performance exceeded expectations in the quarter. We remain committed to making the smart
investments in marketing and people and I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and
dedication.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Dan?
Daniel J. Finnegan
Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide
guidance for the third quarter of 2014. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year
comparable period unless otherwise indicated.
Q2 was a strong quarter from a top and bottom line perspective. Room nights booked grew by 29% in the second
quarter, with solid performance across all our key regions. Average daily rates, or ADRs, for Q2 2014 were up on a
local currency basis by about 3% for the consolidated group.
The FX rate for the euro to the U.S. dollar was favorable for the second quarter compared to the prior year by about
5%. However, the euro weakened versus the dollar as compared to the $1.39 exchange rate that prevailed at the time
we gave Q2 guidance. As a result, the currency exchange rates helped year-over-year U.S. dollar growth, but had a
slightly negative impact compared to our guidance.
Q2 gross bookings grew by 34% compared to prior year. Our Q2 international gross bookings grew by 36% in U.S.
dollars and by about 35% on a local currency basis. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S.
grew by 21%. Performance was strong across retail air, hotel and rental car verticals, including the benefit from
increased advertising placements within KAYAK.
Hotel Express Deals also performed well, but our Name Your Own Price hotel, air and car services were all down
year-over-year due to limited availability of discounted rates and share shift to express deals. I highlight that Name
Your Own Price impacts merchant gross bookings and disproportionately impacts merchant revenues since we record
Name Your Own Price revenues on a gross basis while our other revenues are recorded on a net basis.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.9 billion and grew 36% as compared to the prior year. The inclusion of KAYAK in
our results contributed about 3 percentage points of inorganic gross profit growth for the quarter and a later Easter this
year also benefited Q2 growth.

Our International operations generated gross profit of $1.65 billion, which constituted an increase of 38% as compared
to the prior year and 36% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business, including KAYAK, amounted to
$230 million, which represented 25% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 42% of gross profit for Q2, which is 210 bps lower than last year. Operating
margins were impacted by 76 bps of deleverage in offline advertising mainly related to our Booking.com TV
campaigns and the inclusion of KAYAK offline advertising.
Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit delevered by 50 bps compared to prior year, mainly due to
lower ROIs, partly offset by the favorable impact of including KAYAK. The inclusion of KAYAK benefits this metric
through the anniversary of the acquisition because KAYAK spends relatively less on online advertising as a percentage
of gross profit and spending by our other brands for ad placements on KAYAK is eliminated from our consolidated
results.
Other OpEx also reflects some deleverage because it includes $5.6 million of one-time deal costs incurred in Q2 related
mainly to the OpenTable acquisition. OpEx also includes the impact of our investment in people, offices and IT-related
expenses to support our business growth.
Operating margins came in about 100 bps better than our guidance forecast due mainly to less year-over-year decline
than assumed in online advertising ROIs. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $809 million, which exceeded the top
end of our guidance range of $775 million and represents 30% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP net income grew by 31% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 29%, reflecting the impact of a higher fully diluted
share count. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $690 million of cash from operations during the second
quarter 2014, which is about 16% above last year.
We spent about $32 million on CapEx, and we repaid about $59 million of our 2015 convertible notes upon early
conversion by their holders. Our cash and investments amounted to $7.2 billion at quarter-end, with about $1.8 billion
in the U.S. In July, we used our U.S. cash and $995 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility to fund the
$2.5 billion of cash paid to close the OpenTable acquisition.
Our credit facility does not expire for over two years and represents low cost borrowing at about 1.4% interest. Our
credit rating was recently upgraded by S&P to BBB+ and terms in the investment grade and convertible debt markets
continue to be very attractive. We will evaluate all longer-term financing options available to us going forward.
Before I cover third quarter guidance, I'd like to spend a few moments on recent strategic transactions and their impact
on the forecast. We left the KAYAK acquisition that we made on May 21 last year, so there was no inorganic benefit to
top line and bottom line growth in Q3. We have also seen a meaningful benefit to our online ad efficiency over the past
year from KAYAK's impact on this metric, as I mentioned a moment ago, while discussing Q2 results. This
year-over-year benefit no longer exists in Q3.
OpenTable is included in our forecasted results from the acquisition close date of July 24 through the end of the
quarter. It is only a couple of weeks since the deal closed, so we're in the process of charting the path forward with the
OpenTable team, but we intend to increase investment in Q3 and coming quarters to position the business for future
growth.
We expect that the impact of the OpenTable acquisition on our non-GAAP EPS for Q3 will be slightly accretive. In Q2,
we also acquired certain businesses that provide hotel marketing services, including boutique. Our Q3 forecast includes
the operating expenses for these businesses as they build and refine their services over Q3 and coming quarters to go to
market. We believe that our hotel marketing services team will create compelling offerings for our hotel partners and
help us deepen our relationships with them on a mutually beneficial basis.
Lastly, we just recently announced an expansion of our partnership with Ctrip. We have great respect for the Ctrip team
and are excited at the prospect of partnering more closely with the leading online travel agent in China. We invested
$500 million of our international cash in the Ctrip convertible bond. Ctrip also granted The Priceline Group the right to
purchase their shares in the open market over the next year, so that combined with the shares underlying the convertible

bond, Priceline Group could hold up to 10% of Ctrip's outstanding shares. The impact of the enhanced partnership is
reflected in our guidance forecast, it is not expected to have a significant impact on our near-term financial results.
For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 19% to 29% in U.S. dollars and by 18% to 28%
on a local currency basis. With U.S. gross bookings growing by about 10% to 15%, which reflects lapping certain ad
placements on KAYAK. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 22% to 32% in the U.S. dollars and by
21% to 31% on a local currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group
will be up by about 3% compared to the prior year period.
Our Q3 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.34 per euro and $1.68 per British pound as
Friday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be stronger by about 2% for the euro
and about 9% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. I highlight that the euro exchange rate assumed in
our forecast is about 3% weaker than the $1.39 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we reported Q1 and most
analysts last updated their forecasts.
We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any
fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not
offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our
earnings beyond the third quarter. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 15% to 25% and
gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 21% to 31%. We expect the declines in our Name Your Own Price
service will impact revenue growth rates in Q3.
We expect 350 bps to 400 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared
to prior year, primarily due to lower online ad ROIs, increased offline spend, and increased investment in other
operating expenses. Our Q3 online advertising forecast reflects our actual results to-date and assumes further pressure
throughout the remainder of the quarter based upon the trends we've experienced over the last couple of years.
We estimate that the group will spend roughly $130 million per offline advertising over the back half of the year, with
more than half the spend coming in Q3, which puts us near the high end of the full year range we previously provided.
We are pleased with our forecasted operating margins, as we make the investments for future growth in OpenTable and
hotel marketing services, that we said we would make at the time of the acquisitions.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.265 billion, and $1.365 billion, which at the midpoint represents
18% growth versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of
approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the
U.S.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $19.60 to $21.10 per share, which at the midpoint
represents 18% growth year-over-year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 53.4
million shares based upon Friday's closing stock price. We forecast GAAP EPS between $17.86 and $19.36 per share
for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed
in our earnings release.
In summary, we believe that our forecast reflects another quarter where we would sustain our market-leading top-line
growth rates while maintaining strong bottom line growth and market-leading profit margins.
The advertising investments assumed in our forecast are consistent with our past practice of following a disciplined and
sustainable approach to support our brands, while striking a reasonable balance between growth and profitability. We
believe that investments in restaurant reservation and hotel marketing services will plant seeds for future growth.
Our guidance reflects our actual results to-date and our expectation that such a large business comparing against high
transaction growth rates will experience a pattern of sequential deceleration. Our forecast does not assume any material
change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your
line is now opened.
<Q - Anthony Justin Post>: Great. Thanks. I'll just give one. On the OpenTable acquisition, can you tell us how you
plan to report that in your financials going forward, how we should be thinking about modeling it, and then how you've
incorporated that in your gross profit growth and EBITDA growth and EPS growth guidance for 3Q? Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Hi, Justin. We'll report it in revenue gross profit and in our EBITDA bottom line. It won't
show up in our gross bookings or in our room nights obviously. So those are key metrics that we always point to for the
top-line health of the business, so those will be unimpacted.
For the first year, we'll likely report the revenue that is generated by the business, so you have a read on the inorganic
impact on our growth rates. We won't report, we won't break out their profitability separately. We may break out
specific metrics from time-to-time like restaurant count or seated diners, but I wouldn't think that we're going to be
reporting all those consistently quarter-to-quarter.
<Q - Anthony Justin Post>: Okay. And is there a benefit in your EBITDA or EPS in 3Q?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: There is. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, we've included OpenTable from the
acquisition closed date of July 24 through the end of the quarter. Now, our forecast does reflect our expectation that
we're going to make investments in the business, as we said at the timing of the acquisition, particularly in the area of
international growth. And so, our forecast also reflects those investments.
<Q - Anthony Justin Post>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the marketing environment.
And, Darren, if you could just go into some more detail on your comments on ROI and what you're expecting in 3Q
here. And also, I think, Darren, you talked about disciplined approach on mobile, if you could elaborate on that a little
bit as well. Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Doug. So on a – in terms of the marketing environment, I would
say on the online side, it's, obviously, a very competitive environment, but relatively stable. I'd say, we're being like
always, a little bit prudent because we don't completely control that environment and if in the next six weeks of
changes, we want to make sure that we reflect that in our guidance.
But nothing other than that specifically to report. Obviously, the offline marketing is the subset we completely control
and that's an area where we've decided we're still within the range from the higher end of the range we gave on offline
marketing and we're making investments specifically with KAYAK and Booking.com in Europe and we've actually
seen it's a really nice result from the investments we've made to-date and we're deciding to double down a little bit on
that on the back end of the summer. But those are the two things as it relates to marketing.
I'd say also from an online perspective, of course, we're in this competitive environment, but we also mentioned our
direct business is increasing quite nicely. That's the kind of effect you'd want to see, if you do a lot of offline marketing.
This is also a bit of a mobile effect, more of our business on mobile comes direct. I think that's a real healthy trend for

the future. Of course, we want to continue to bring new customers into the franchise and that's why we do marketing,
but those customers are sticking to the platform and coming back directly which is a real positive sign.
And just a final comment on the mobile front. We continue to feel really good about our mobile products, both our
Web-based products and our app products. We don't talk about the percentage of our business that gets done on mobile,
but it's definitely in line with the other players in our industry. And we continue to see really significant growth on
mobile going forward. And that's not We're seeing that everywhere we buy demand and it's really the nature of the
customers' transition to more of a multi-screen environment versus just a pure desktop business.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Two questions please. Darren, on the direct approach that you're talking about, this direct
business, could you quantify how much your business now you would say is direct, and I assume you mean people
coming directly to your brands rather than coming to you through search engine marketing channels. And is the – what
learnings do you have about how the loyalty of these customers, the profitability of customers that come to you directly
versus through the other channels you used in the past?
And then just briefly on Ctrip, it sounds like it's not that material. But could you talk about the mechanics of the deal
and maybe it's not that changed from what you've had in the past. But how should that impact – if it's successful, how
should that impact your bookings revenue and earnings five years down the road? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Mark. I would say first on the direct approach, we don't like to
reveal the exact percentages but we get direct and what we don't. The way we do think about it though is it's all of the
free demand that we get, basically, people coming and typing in Booking.com are coming through our app.
We often also include, of course SEO, email. There's a bit of a debate on the SEM we spend on our own brand because
that's very high ROI. But we do consider that indirect, because we are buying the customer. But those customers,
obviously, if they type Booking.com into a search engine and pick our ad, we do pay for them, but it's at a lower rate.
And that, obviously, helps us the more who do that versus finding us in other ways.
But generally speaking, it's a positive trend, but we like to, of course, keep a good balance. We are also pushing
account signup more on Booking.com and our other brands, and a much higher percentage of our customers now use
accounts, and those accounts were also used to experience the brand more than just a booking brand. It's to get their
confirmation when they arrive on site. It's also for us to give them other offers. We give our accountholders discounted
rates, things like that. And that's also improving the business that comes back to us through accountholders, who
generally tend to book more direct than they do through paid channels because they have an established relationship
with us.
And then onto Ctrip, the mechanics are basically – Ctrip is a channel for us. We – if a Ctrip customer books at
Booking.com or an Agoda hotel room, then we record that and then the cost of marketing is what we pay Ctrip in terms
of the revenue share. It's kind of a typical affiliate relationship.
And that we hope gets better and stronger, because in this next phase of our relationship, we're really working closely
with Ctrip to both brand – so the Ctrip customer knows their booking on Booking or Agoda, but also to improve the
content that's being used to market international accommodation to Ctrip customers.
The other side of this deal, which actually is completely new, is us using Ctrip's properties and using those on
Booking.com in a reciprocal fashion. So we will have customers who come from overseas and may want to stay in a
really small village in China, and which may not see a lot of international demand, we'll be able to offer them a product
that is actually supplied by Ctrip, but we end up doing the booking and they, of course, pay us back for that customer as
well.

So, I obviously – we see even regardless of the Ctrip deal, Chinese bookers, they're one of the fastest growing bookers
on all of our properties, particularly on Agoda and Booking, and we think that this will only accelerate that and, of
course, tapping into China is going to be a huge benefit, both because they're a great source of bookings, but also we're
running a global business here and we believe 5 years, 10 years down the road, it'd be hard to say, you're global if
you're not big in China and this is just a next step for us in what will likely be a series of steps as we move closer and
closer to Ctrip over time.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks, Darren.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Dean Prissman of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Dean J. Prissman>: Thanks for taking my questions. So, Darren, just sticking with Ctrip, obviously, given the
market opportunity of outbound demand from China, I think the strategic motivations for the enhanced distribution
agreements are very clear. However, could you shed some light on the strategic motivations underpinning the
investment in the company?
And then I think you previously indicated that when you acquired KAYAK, The Priceline Group's brands were
underrepresented as advertisers on the platform. To what degree are you fully represented now? And if not, can you
give us a qualitative sense on how much runway remains and then I have one follow-up afterwards? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. I would say, first of all, on the Ctrip deal, our original relationship in 2012 was
commercial and it was fairly arm's length. It was really meant to test the international product for Ctrip and also to
build a relationship between the two companies to see – a lot of this does come down to cultural match and can we
work together and can we build trust together. And this next wave is really a next step and we felt that making an
investment in Ctrip along with the commercial relationship also allowed us to go much deeper in the commercial
relationship was also something that was important to Ctrip as well.
And I think also in a north Asian context, taking a minority share is a positive next step. It shows that we're also aligned
with their success, that Ctrip becomes more successful and we become more comfortable on the commercial side,
pushing our brands to one another's customers, but that's really the reason behind it. I think it's a very safe investment
in the way that we built it, it gives us a lot of options going forward.
Both sides, we retained a lot of flexibility in our – in both running our own businesses, but also I mentioned to James,
we're almost like second cousins now. We're not necessarily married, but we are certainly related and that also for our
employees on both sides, I think, of the camp they then understand really the relationship between the two companies
as more special than a standard arm's length commercial relationship.
And your second question was – Dean, was on KAYAK.
<Q - Dean J. Prissman>: Yeah.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. I would say, we haven't started it, because we go back and forth. As you know,
with the group we run our brands very independently and I give Steve a hard time all the time. I would say we have a
reasonable presentation on KAYAK. We don't do anything with KAYAK to tilt the playing field at all. We keep a very
strong Chinese wall between the work that they do with many of our competitors, who are also advertisers on KAYAK
and we haven't done anything to change those dynamics.
But I would say, at this point, relative to the market share that we have, particularly in the United States where
KAYAK is strongest, our brands are reasonably represented, but I always believe we could do more, but I think about
that more in an arm's length way of how can booking in Agoda and Priceline work even closer with KAYAK to get a
more meaningful share of their business. But, our share on KAYAK, I would say is as represented as we are on say,
TripAdvisor or other platforms that aren't owned by the group.

<Q - Dean J. Prissman>: Great. And just final question being, I was wondering if you could quantify the impact that
the Agoda headwinds you called out had on your room night growth in the quarter?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: No, we wouldn't separately break that out. It's hard to quantify an impact too, Dean. We
can see when a market is impacted, the growth rate suffers. But, we don't know to what extent those people are instead
going and staying in Malaysia or Indonesia, so we don't put out a quantification on that.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: One thing I would just highlight is that, Agoda had – in Asia, generally, what we saw
because of the issues in Thailand, but there are also issues in Vietnam, et cetera, that and also the Malaysian air
tragedy, the original one that Chinese bookers are among the biggest bookers in the region and many of them decided
to travel into North Asia. So, we both saw great business in North Asia, but a lot less in Southeast Asia.
So generally, that would balance out, but Agoda has the other issue that they're very strong with bookers in Southeast
Asia, and there was some nervousness among bookers in Southeast Asia, given everything that was going on there, but
as I mentioned as well, we do hope that that is abating and we do see some positive signs that that particular situation
won't impact us as much going forward.
<Q - Dean J. Prissman>: Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Tom White>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the issue of direct versus sort of paid traffic, it seems
like you guys are benefiting from your recent branding campaigns but I guess my question I guess is on the meta-search
channel. A lot of those guys are also investing considerably in consumer marketing. Can you maybe comment a bit on
whether that channel, the meta-search players is kind of increasing as a percentage of your mix, or is your direct traffic
gains coming primarily from, say, sort of traditional paid search or affiliate channels, other channels? And then just
quickly, on the hotel marketing services opportunity, the acquisition of buuteeq seems interesting, maybe just a bit
more color on the strategy there and potential synergies. Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, thanks, Tom. We – generally speaking among our paid source of the demand,
meta has been quite strong, although I would say a little less so in the last few months in terms of its percentage.
Probably the biggest weakness in term of growth has been Google and PPC overall. And I think that reflects as much
Google's shift from desktop to mobile. We do think in all these channels, by the way, that we are increasing our share
of these channels, but I should also flag that meta-search is not that critical to our business. It's an important channel,
but PPC and even our affiliate business would hold up to our overall meta-search business. So that's a little bit of color
there. And when you compare direct to overall paid, our direct business is going faster than our paid business.
And then when it comes to hotel marketing services, we don't want to reveal too many cards here, but right now, before
we acquired buuteeq and Hotel Ninjas, we already had a number of products that we were selling B2B, basically to
hotels. We do a lot of white label sites for the chains and other languages. We also have our product both Agoda and
that's called the Booking Button, that allows hotel websites to add booking functionality at no cost to their websites. All
of these are things we're doing to increase our values to hotels, but now we're looking at cloud-based solutions to really
help hotels improve their own direct marketing over time and there'll be more to report on that in the coming months
and quarter-to-quarter.

<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks, guys. So, I had a question on the kind of offline marketing versus online marketing,
so you're now about two years into the offline campaign, and can you broadly talk about how you're measuring success
of the program? And at some point, do you expect to see your online marketing start to show leverage when combined
with this pace of offline marketing as we've seen with some other companies? It doesn't look like it's showing up yet in
the financials, but maybe on a country-by-country basis, are you seeing that?
And then second question is, for the customers that you're bringing direct from these new mobile channels, can you just
talk about how the LTV or the purchase frequency compares to customers that have come in historically under the PC
channel as you've measured it? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. Hey, Ross, first of all, on the offline versus online, there's a set of macro
measures that are important and then there's a set of micro measures. Let me start, the micro measures are about how
you spend and the media you use and the ROI you get from funding an ad on this channel versus that channel. That's all
a very sophisticated set of measures that helps you improve the ROI you get from offline in the short to medium term.
The macro measure, of course, if you add online plus offline in any market, you want to be able to increase your return
on overall advertising in that market. And often that takes some time. It can be 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 24
months. But that ultimately is the goal and if we don't achieve that, if ultimately we can't get a market from a level of
return, before we did offline to a higher return after we did offline, then that wasn't a good investment to make.
We're still early on, even though it feels like we've been doing this for a long time. Many of our markets even Australia,
which is our second market, hasn't even lapped a year. But we feel relatively confident that over time we can improve
our return on advertising in every market using a positive mix of marketing tools, including offline and online
marketing. But again, this is early learning and we're quite positive but more to come.
As it relates to mobile, you always have to go into the different aspects of mobile. Lots has been written about last
minute booking. Obviously, if you look on a per-transaction basis, and this is now mostly mobile phones, a last minute
booking is usually for one night, and on average, our bookings are two nights or more. So that immediately makes it a
less valuable booking. But what you don't know is if that's Dan, for instance, booking a last minute booking, he may be
a customer that his next booking may be a five night booking, and you got to be careful that you don't under attribute
the value or maybe you're finding Dan on his cellphone and the next time finding Dan on a PC.
The other thing I would say about mobile is, that's a very specific thing on last minute booking. But we've also seen a
trend where people are doing more and more early booking. And a lot of that is happening on tablets, as they are early
on their research process, and we find that tablet-based booking is as, if not at times more, valuable even than PC
bookings. So it's you shouldn't just paint all of this stuff with a single brush. And you have to look into the economics
of each channel then, obviously, what you're willing to pay vis-à-vis the attribution of the customer when you try to
find that demand. I hope that's helpful.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Yeah. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense from maybe a more macro
perspective. As we look at occupancy rates at record highs is – and the increases that we've seen in ADRs. Do you have
a sense of whether or not that's been a positive or negative headwind for your business. And to the extent that we think
about kind of how this is going to have an impact over the next year, whether or not we're seeing any sort of crowding
out of the leisure market as occupancy rates hit that level, and you start to see the less price sensitive business market
continue to take share versus leisure?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. Thanks, Heath. I'll jump into that one. So, first of all, the important thing is not
to paint too much of a brush on things geographically because the U.S. market is very different than many other

markets. You've got extremes like if you look at four star and five star hotels in China, they're still running at very low
occupancy because that's a market that's overbuilt.
And then you have different destinations some are very business oriented, some are very leisure oriented like in
Orlando and some are kind of a mix if you look at a city like New York. Also leisure customers also tend to be valuable
customers to hotels. It depends on where their business customers are coming from. Business customers will sometimes
pay higher ADR, but in some hotels, the leisure customer may be worth more depending on how the business customer
was acquired.
In our business, generally, our business works well positively with the cycle, meaning if ADRs go up, then our
commissions are higher. But we also have a counter cyclicality, which is, in low demand periods, we, obviously, get
better availability and that helps our opaque business and other high discount products build supply. So we're able to be
a little bit – we can ride the cycles quite well because of these countering effects.
And I don't believe that we're seeing an environment almost in any market where we're feeling crowded out of demand.
Certainly, right now as we speak this is high season in Europe, literally this week and we still have availability in most
markets in Europe and then we're going to go in, obviously, at the end of fall and we're going to have a lot more
opportunities to sell a lot more product.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking the question. Darren, just going back to your comments about
KAYAK and seeing top line acceleration in that business, were you referring to the business on a gross basis or just on
a net basis? And then, regarding the expansion in Europe for KAYAK, do you plan to focus more on the hotel side or
on the air side and can you just clarify that for us?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, I would say the comments with KAYAK on a gross or net are both the same.
And then regarding their expansion, I think the team is still working that out. In Europe they've been – in the
advertising if you see it, it's been more of an air message, that's then taken into hotel, but they're experimenting with
various types of copy to see which works best.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Okay, great.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Thanks. Maybe two quick follow-ups. On OpenTable, you mentioned rolling out pay with
OpenTable in San Francisco, New York and 20 other cities by year-end. Any additional color on other facets of the
integration timeline or focuses there and when you expect to see kind of the real meaty plan to leverage or benefit from
the acquisition? So that's one follow-up.
And then the second one, to Doug's question on advertising ROIs, last quarter you mentioned conscientious decision do
invest in variable channels. Are the ROIs you see there inherently higher than in other channels, and that's why you
decided to focus there or is it you believe you can extract better results from these channels than the market of any of
your competitors? Thanks.

<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Brian. I'd say first on OpenTable, yeah, we certainly haven't been – we did a lot of
planning. And we're now in the execution phase of those plans. As we highlighted during the acquisition, there's really
three areas we're focused on. One is international expansion. So, we're in the middle of those plans, really exciting and
so that's an issue of product getting all the language translations, an issue of which cities, how fast. But I expect it will
be through the fall, like get ourselves aligned and begin executing fairly forthrightly.
The second area is co-marketing and that's something that's in the plans right now. Co-marketing is really, if you're a
Booking.com guest from London staying in New York, co-promoting the OpenTable app and the restaurants around
your hotel, for instance, and those are tests that we hope to put in play pretty quickly.
And then finally was the payment area and you have the update on that. So, I feel really good about where we are.
There's lots of work to do. The teams are now moving between San Francisco and Amsterdam, in particular, doing a lot
of learning and a lot of things that come into play and I think, by 2015, I hope we'll be in full rollout of those plans.
As it relates to ROIs in variable channels, there's a lot that goes into ROIs. Certainly, it's a very competitive
environment and the costs of buying a booker have been going up. We try to counteract that by increasing investments
on our website. So, they convert better, which we've been seeing some good success with, but also building more direct
business, so that we rely less and less on the paid demand, which is allowing us basically creating currency to more
aggressively go out and find those customers through paid channels.
Not much else to it other than that. Obviously, we try to balance our ROIs against the various sources of demand and
we both evaluate the ROI of the demand and then also the importance and strategic nature of the demand. Is it
something that we're buying where we get full access to the customer and can cross-market to them, et cetera., or is it a
source that doesn't allow us near as much freedom to build a long-term relationship with that customer. And that's how
we set our ROI targets and we're quite disciplined as a company around that. And basically making sure that we don't
really look at lifetime value, although we value that, we're looking at how we earn money on every single conversion
that we buy.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Great. Thanks, Darren.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Josey of JMP Securities. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, more of a high level question, I guess. Darren,
we're now a few years into the expansion of Booking.com here in the U.S. I'm just wondering what the impact has been
from other international markets as more hotels come here, are available here domestically and specifically, demand
from, call it, Europe and South America coming here and then vice versa.
And then also just a real quick follow-up on the marketing line, I think you said TV in Germany, I understand you are
marketing more in TV here, but why Germany now? Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thanks, Ronald. Let me first address the U.S. We announced on a previous
conference call, the U.S. is now Booking.com's largest destination market and certainly, we've had historic business
that comes in from Europe and that generally lands in a few obvious destinations: New York, Washington D.C., a lot of
East Coast destinations, Orlando. But recently, we've seen a significant impact from guests from Latin America. I was
recently in Miami talking to some hoteliers and they think we're the Brazilian OTA, which of course we are, but they –
that's how they think about us, because it's the guests that shows up from Booking.com. And then, out on the West
Coast, a significant increase with Asian guests and Pacific guests from Oceania maybe up in San Francisco and Las
Vegas, et cetera.
So I feel a lot better about the international demand we're bringing to the United States. But even more importantly,
what I get excited about is we're getting more U.S. guests staying in the U.S. It's probably one of our fastest growing
markets, as American domestic travelers kind of discovering the tremendous flexibility of pay when you stay instead of

paying ahead and really loving the diversity of properties that we have in our site. And that's really the thing that's
creating a tipping point in the U.S. market for us. And we're now at a level of accommodation and property options that
I feel very proud of. And the U.S. is right up there with some of our more mature European markets in terms of what
we can offer our customers but much, much more to do.
And then Germany, the decision really was we came into the UK, which is a fairly we can call it "mature market" for
us. But we saw some really positive results there because even despite how successful we've been in the UK, our aided
awareness was not near where we wanted it to be. But we've seen some acceleration in the UK as bookers. And we
decide to go in Germany, Germany has been a market for us in Europe that we do well in. But we under-index relative
to what we do in the rest of Western Europe, primarily because we have some domestic competition, and a lot of
Germans surprisingly just travel to Germany. But the campaign so far has done a nice job. I mean it's very early days of
introducing Germans, you can use Booking.com if you love to travel to Italy or Spain or to France, but it's also a great
tool to travel within Germany as well. So that was – really it was the next largest obvious market for us in Europe,
given where our aided awareness and our penetration is relative to others.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Associates. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Michael Millman>: Thank you. First, I wanted to follow up on an earlier question regarding the mobile, and
particularly, same-day mobile. I was wondering if there's a backend of cancellations that may be going to others. I
guess I feel that's unusual all these people continue to travel without reservations.
And, secondly, on U.S. car rental, also, to what extent are you seeing growth, if you think growth in mobile. And to
what extent are you seeing – you mentioned that opaque is less available, to what extent, therefore, are you seeing more
increased pricing, and to what extent are you seeing higher mileage cars, and how is that affecting the interest in people
renting? Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Hey, thanks, Michael. I'm going to take the first one, let Dan take the second one.
Yeah, it's an interesting question you asked about last minute booking on mobile. Knowing what I know, there are
some cities in Europe that it's dangerous to show up and not have a booking and if you arrive at the airport, because it
can literally be closed, all sold out in certain seasons. But, it is a very spontaneous thing.
And, the other thing about accommodations is unlike in a lot of other aspects of travel, you can get a last minute
booking for potentially less than you would get a booking that you've made 7 days, 14 days, 21 days in advance. Now,
it's a little bit of a risky proposition but, at the end of the day, the hotel room needs to fill a room.
And, also the reason people use apps for this is if you walk into a hotel room and say I need a room, they're not
necessarily going to give you the price that's published on the Internet because you're standing in the hotel room and
you need a room, and a lot of people use apps and OTAs in particular to try to get a really good price at the last minute.
But it is a little bit of a gamble and you got to be smart about how you do it. But you can't really get a lot of great deals,
last minute in this particular aspect of travel.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Hi, Michael. As far as the questions on U.S. car rental, so car rental tracks similarly to the
rest of our services, in that mobile is growing much faster, as more people are adopting, doing booking on mobile
devices and research on mobile devices. So we're growing very fast there and we're pleased with the offerings that we
have, particularly at Priceline.com for U.S. car rental.
We did say opaque is less available, so we are seeing that paired with increased pricing and just a very healthy travel
environment. It also drives up pricing particularly on our opaque services because we were unable to get the same level
of discounts that we got in the past. And so, we're unable to give the level of discount that we typically could and that
drives up the pricing there. I don't have any information for you really in terms of higher mileage cars being used to a

Thank you. And our final question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Hi. Thanks. Can you give us more color on your alternative accommodations initiative
that should have a Villas.com launch performed versus your expectations? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thanks, Kevin. Yeah, we gave a little bit of – in my comments, I'd mentioned to you
that in this what we call vacation rental space, we're already a very large player. As we went a couple of years ago from
being completely about hotels and non-hotels was a very natural migration for us to go into non-hotel categories like
resorts and motels, et cetera to get into what we would call more self-catered product, like aparthotels, vacation rentals,
apartments, et cetera. So, this has been a long-term journey. There's a lot to do, because there are a lot of challenges
around the vacation rental bookings. Who's going to show up with the keys, who's changing the sheets, a lot of vacation
rentals need deposits.
And there's the things in the market have them built up in a way where the rents are expected to dance back and forth
with the guest on email or by phone until they finally come to some kind of settlement, and our business is purely about
booking and getting an instant confirmation, and requiring vacation rental owners to keep a live calendar that's real, and
pricing that's real, and everything you would expect in a modern e-commerce business.
So, there's many challenges, but we're now doing a real significant amount of business in this space, and Villas.com
specifically is just one of many tactics we're taking to try to really prove out and test various options for being
successful in the vacation rental space. And so far, we're really pleased with the results of that effort, but again, it's part
of a much broader set of actions that we're taking.
Having vacation rentals on our site has proven to be a great synergy for people who are just looking for a place to stay.
We even find that people with families may think they're going to Barcelona and they're going to stay in two or three
hotel rooms and they end up in a home by the beach at potentially a cheaper price if they're a large group. So, for many
people, it's even an upgrade when you're on leisure travel. It's just been really, really hard in the past to book and to feel
