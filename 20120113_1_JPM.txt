MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Please stand by. We are about to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth
quarter 2011 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted throughout the duration of
the conference. We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over
to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr.
Braunstein, please go ahead.
Douglas L. Braunstein
Thanks, operator. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation that's available on our website. We'll take
questions after we walk through the presentation and remember, the disclaimer in the back of the presentation.

So if you turn to page 1, for the quarter, we generated net income of $3.7 billion, $0.90 per share on revenues of $22.2
billion. Return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 11%. For the full year, we generated record net income
of $19 billion. That's up 9% over last year, $4.48 per share which was also a record per share on revenues of a little
under $100 billion. Return on tangible common equity for the year was approximately 15%.
There's a few significant items in the quarter. We highlight them up front. I'm going to discuss each of them in the
businesses. So as you see we ended the quarter on a tier 1 common basis of $123 billion, strong Basel 1 Basel III ratios
of 10% and 7.9% respectively, and for the full year, we increased our Basel III ratio by approximately 90 basis points
and that's after the re-purchase of $9 billion of our stock this year.
As we noted last quarter, we continue to see year-on-year loan growth across many of the businesses. Total loan
balances across the company were up $31 billion year-on-year, and if you exclude the impact of the $30 billion in
runoff in our home lending portfolio, predominantly WaMu related, the year-on-year growth $60 billion would be a run
rate of 9% year-over-year, and just to highlight some of the specific small business loans were up 52%. Market loans
up 17%. Trade finance loans, up 73%. We also saw a card outstanding growth this quarter and solid mortgage
originations. Deposit growth also continued in the quarter. Liability balances ended the year at $1.1 trillion. That's up
$200 billion or 21% year-on-year.
I've covered much of the data on page 2 and 3. So if you turn right into the investment bank on page 4, you see circled
net income of $720 million. That's on revenue of $4.4 billion. We highlighted on page 1 the first significant item
impacted the IB results this quarter. That's $570 million DVA loss on a pre-tax basis and that reduced our reported EPS
for the quarter by $0.09 a share and that's largely the result of the firm's tightening credit spreads this quarter.
You know, we've consistently said we don't consider these gains or losses to be part of the underlying operating
performance of the business, but when it's material to the results, we're go going to identify that number as a significant
item. If you exclude DVA, revenue for the IB in the quarter was $4.9 billion. That's up 10% quarter-on-quarter. It's still
down 21% year-on-year. Net income ex-DVA was $1.1 billion this quarter.
So if you go into the particulars, IB fees of $1.1 billion this quarter are down almost 40% year-on-year, up modestly
quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by the low industry-wide volumes that we talked about last quarter. We did
maintain our number one ranking for global IB fees this year, and we also generated record loan syndication fees this
year which is, again, part of that loan story we talked about. You can find the league table results in the back in the
appendix on page 20.
Fixed income markets, revenues of $2.6 billion, ex-DVA, that's down 9% year-on-year, 6% quarter-on-quarter and we
continue to see solid client revenue across most of our products in fixed income.
Equity markets revenue was $0.8 billion. That's ex-DVA down 26% year-on-year, 23% quarter-on-quarter. That's
primarily been driven by lower market volumes and I would add we had some consistent results again this quarter in
our prime services businesses so the volume impact was largely in our cash and our derivatives business. We
recognized negative revenues of $31 million, I'm sorry in the credit portfolio. Largely driven by the DVA losses and
that's offset by the NII on fees and retained loans, and then we had a small net CVA gain this quarter.
Credit costs in the quarter are $272 million. That largely reflected some name specific charge-offs, and then on the
expense side, you see $3 billion in expenses, down a little under 30% year-on-year. That's driven by lower comp and
lower non-comp expenses. The comp-to-revenue ratio for the year we reported was 34%. If you exclude DVA, the
revenue was 36%, and that's largely at the lower end of our prior guidance of 35% to 40% for the year.
So with that, I'm going to actually skip page 5 as well and drill down to specifics of CBB on page 6. You see circled net
income of $800 million. That's down 16% year-on-year on revenues of $4.3 billion. Revenues are down $365 million
quarter-on-quarter. That largely reflects the impact of Durbin this quarter. Year-on-year, revenues are down 2% and
that was an increase in deposit-related fees that partially offset the impact of Durbin this quarter.
We continue to see very positive growth in a number of the fundamental measures we keep track of for the business
year-on-year. Total deposits were up $25 billion, 260 new branch builds during the course of 2011. 246 CPC, Chase

Private Client branches, opened this year and we added 3,800 new sales staff, bankers, salesmen, mortgage brokers
during the course of the year.
Expenses up 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by that investment spend I just talked about. Also, I want to remind you
the impact of both the rate environment and the regulatory environment on 2012 earnings, we expect spread
compression likely to have a negative impact on earnings next year of about $400 million, plus or minus, as deposit
margins are going to continue to decline in 2012. And on the Durbin amendment, we've said it will reduce earnings by
$600 million plus or minus on an annualized basis in the course of 2012.
If you skip – move to page 7, mortgage production and servicing, loss for the business of $260 million this quarter and
that compares to net income of $330 million in the prior year. Production-related revenues, that's at the top of the page,
and if you exclude repurchases, was $1.1 billion. That's down 20% year-on-year; originations of $39 billion are down
24% year-on-year, but up actually slightly quarter-on-quarter, and we experienced some lower margin in that business.
I'd also add activity this quarter was largely driven by refinancing.
Repurchase losses in the quarter, you see were $390 million. That's slightly higher in the quarter based on acceleration
of the timing of certain claims with the agencies. We do continue to expect for next year $350 million plus or minus per
quarter in repurchase losses, and that's largely in line with our prior guidance, and I'll remind everyone our total
repurchase reserves remained at $3.6 billion; $3.2 billion in this division.
Servicing-related revenue in the middle of the page of $1.1 billion is down 9% year-on-year and that's largely a decline
in our service portfolio. And that was partially offset by a reduction in the amortization of the MSR asset. Servicing
expense, you see in the middle, $925 million in the quarter. It remains very elevated as a function of default costs,
which represent about 75% of that total number, and we would expect that number to remain high certainly through the
first half of 2012. We did record an MSR risk management loss of a little under $400 million this quarter – $377
million. The results really are a combination of reduction of the MSR asset of $830 million. That's based on valuation
adjustments and rate. And that was offset by a $460 million gain from hedging the asset. And for those interested in the
MSR, I'd point you to a detail in the financial supplement in the footnotes.
Page 8, real estate portfolios; a modest net loss in the quarter. That compared to a net loss of a little over $800 million
in the prior year. Revenues, same story as we've been talking about; down 20% year-on-year; consistent with the
reduction in the NII from the portfolio runoff. And, as we said was $700 million a year and remember, balances were
down $30 billion year-on-year. We'd expect to see balances continue to decline somewhere in the 10% to 15% range
again in 2012, and that would have the result of reducing NII next year by $500 million plus or minus, but remember,
that reduction will also free up capital at the company level.
Expenses, up 5% year-on-year and that continues to be consistent with the overall increase in servicing costs that I
talked about in mortgage servicing.
I want to cover credit on page 9. So if you turn to 9, you see circled net charge-offs of $877 million. That's, again, a
marginal improvement versus the prior quarter. We experienced improvement this quarter in our early stage
delinquencies. You can see those charts on page 19 in the appendix, and we saw that improvement both in our NCI and
our PCI portfolios, and again, we've experienced the consistent improving level of net charge-offs for several quarters
in the NCI portfolio.
So the results of those factors is a net release of $230 million in our home lending portfolio and there are two
components to that reserve change. First, in NCI, we took a $1 billion reduction in reserves, primarily due to the
improvement in our outlook for losses, particularly in home equity and subprime, and reminder now, current reserve
levels for the portfolio are at $8.7 billion. The PCI portfolio, we actually added $770 million to reserves and that,
remember, is a lifetime loss estimate and while we've seen improvement in the delinquencies in the portfolio, they
weren't as significant as we expected in our lifetime loss estimates, primarily driven by default frequencies relative to
modeled expectations, and so we, therefore, increased reserves.
Reserves in the portfolio now are $5.7 billion, but if you step back from all of this given the improvement in credit
performance, you'll see over in the right we're revising our quarterly loss guidance to $900 million, plus or minus.

That's down from the $1.2 billion we had in the prior quarter and that's for 2012.
If you turn to page 10, Card Services and Auto, circle consolidated net income for the business of $1.1 billion, that's on
revenues of $4.8 billion. You know, we continue to see the trend that we talked about all year. Credit costs down again
this quarter. You see the details on the Chase portfolio at the bottom of the page. 3.93% net charge-off rate, that's again,
below our through the cycle target, 30 plus day delinquencies declined to 2.54%. That's 112 basis points below the
prior year.
And just a quick note here; we're going to report Chase and WaMu portfolios as a single portfolio in 2012 and for the
combined portfolio which end ended 2011 at a net charge-off rate at 4.33%, we'd expect Q1 rate to be 4.50% plus or
minus. It tends to be slightly elevated versus the year-end, just literally as a function of seasonality, but the absolute
numbers should be consistent.
As we highlighted on page 1, we did release $500 million in loan loss reserves this quarter in our card business and if
you add that to the home lending actions, the combined release across consumer was $730 million and that had a
positive impact on EPS of $0.11 a share.
Back to card, though, total reserves in card will end the year at $7 billion. That's 5.3% of our outstandings, and the final
note I'd say on card is on a sales volume basis, it continued to the be very solid results for the Chase portfolio, up 9%
year-on-year, 14% if you exclude the impact of the Kohl's portfolio sale that we had and part of those increases are
really being driven by our new product Sapphire Freedom, Inc. where sales growth is actually higher than the average.
The result of all of that is we continue to think we picked up close to 180 basis points of market share in the Visa and
the MasterCard systems.
Page 11, the Commercial Bank, you see circled net income of $640 million. That's on record revenues of $1.7 billion.
Full-year revenues of $6.4 billion, $2.4 billion in net income are both record performance for the business, and the
revenue growth and the earnings continue to be driven by that same story of loan growth and liability balances. Six
consecutive quarter of loan growth balances. You see EOP balances of $112 billion circled. That's up 13%. The market
balances continued strong growth are up 17% year-on-year. That's the seventh consecutive quarter of growth and we
also had record liability balances just slightly under $200 billion, up 35% or $52 billion year-on-year. So our customers
are very well capitalized today, and then the overhead ratio continues to be very strong, credit story continues to be
strong. The result is really excellent performance in our commercial bank this year.
Treasury and Security Services on page 12. Revenues are up 6% year-on-year. In part, we had stronger growth in our
TS business. You do see circled net income down 18% quarter-on-quarter of 250 million, really driven by two factors.
We had some expense increases this quarter driven by exiting some unprofitable business we had, and also credit costs
increased this quarter and that's related to some of those name specific charge-offs that I talked about in the Investment
Bank. We have a share of credit expenses between those two businesses.
We did, though, continue to see some real favorable trends in the quarter for the business. Liability balances up 42%,
over $100 billion. I talked about trade loan up front and then international revenue growth, which is a big strategic push
for us, grew 16% year-on-year and for the year, international represented 55% of the total revenue for this business.
That's up from 49% last year so very good performance there.
Asset Management on page 13, they had a weaker quarter and that was largely driven by market conditions. Revenues
at $2.3 billion are down 13% year-on-year. Relatively flat quarter-on-quarter, but the fourth quarter tends to be higher
than normal and we had lower performance fees this quarter. So for the year, however, we did generate $9.5 billion of
revenue and that was a record revenue number for this business, and it does reflect the positive long-term flows that
we've seen throughout the year and a little better markets on average than 2010. It was our 11th consecutive quarter of
positive long-term flows. We had $53 billion for the year. And we also did experience some significant inflows in our
liquidity products this quarter.
Expenses, while down year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter for this quarter were up 15% for the full year. We added a
thousand people to this business, 700 of which are front office personnel bankers, salespeople, brokers and all that, you

know, we expect that to improve future performance. Clearly it had a depressing impact on margins this quarter.
Page 14, Private Equity and Corporate. Private Equity experienced a loss of $90 million. That's primarily due to market
valuations and a lack of monetization opportunities in the quarter. Corporate, you see net income of a little over $300
million. That includes $528 million of an increase in litigation reserve. That was one of our significant items that
reduced EPS $0.08 a share this quarter. The increase in reserves was predominantly for mortgage-related matters and
then you see to the right, we do expect corporate, excluding private equity and significant items, to be a $200 million
plus or minus net income number each quarter in 2012 and that's really a result of positioning the portfolio as well as
some of the RWA implications of Basel III and what we can hold in the portfolio.
I believe I've covered all the items on pages 15 and 16. So with that, operator, if you wouldn't mind, why don't you
open it up for questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Hi, yes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about managing expenses in a tough
environment. If the revenue environment remains tough, do you have plans to push expenses down company-wide in
2012 and maybe also just in the investment bank? Do you see the comp ratio moving lower amid all the regulatory
changes and industry pullback, or do you expect 35% to 40% again in 2012? Thanks.
<A - James Dimon>: Why don't you take a shot?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, on the expense front, I think we are constantly working to try and manage the
expenses. As you saw, expenses, John, we're down in the quarter versus year-over-year, and we're going to continue to
manage it, and that's what we're expecting of all of our businesses. On the comp to revenue side on the Investment
Bank, we think we paid appropriately given the performance of the Investment Bank, and I think we're going to expect
it to return at appropriate levels based on that payout, but we're going to constantly be aware of what's going on in the
market. We'll see where the markets end for 2011 for everyone.
<A - James Dimon>: We basically expect our overhead, i.e., non-IB comp, to be about flat next year. Remember,
that's after a lot of invest investments, too. I think we have pretty good expense control. The only thing I want to say
about IB comp, I think you will see it stay around those numbers. There's an awful lot of pressure, we're getting an
awful lot of pressure for our bankers and traders to increase our payout ratio to about what newspapers and media have,
which is a little bit higher.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: And the thing you expect to be flat next year, Jamie, is your kind of core overhead, SG&A
type ex-litigation reserves?
<A - James Dimon>: Yeah, so if you look at the overhead which is almost $50 billion a year, and that's ex-IB comp
and things that we have for litigation or something like that, to be essentially flat. But the way you think about that is
we're making huge investments and if we have opportunities to market or do other stuff, we change that all the time.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay. And then on the net interest margin, Doug, it was up a bit this quarter. It looks like
maybe some of the trading funding cost was lower. Can you talk about what drove that and what kind of outlook do
you have for the NIM in 2012?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: In NIM, John, it was really for the quarter, it was really a mix issue in part. We had
lower cash. We had some redeployment in Treasury, and then we also had some lower rates on the deposit businesses
so that's what we saw.

I'd say for the outlook for the first quarter, we expect to see some downward pressure on NIM in the first quarter and
that will be, you know, as we continue this mix in our portfolio on the loan side, greater growth on the wholesale side
and some runoff in the consumer side, we'll also see a little lower-yielding loans that we add on, and the other piece I'd
say is we got a lower yield in investment securities, I think, expected in this rate environment.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Just as a follow-up; what kind of regulatory event is necessary for you to be able to redeem
the $10 billion in TruPS [Trust Preferred Securities] that you talked about and when do you anticipate that might
happen?
<A - James Dimon>: We talked about that and I think clarification on the Basel III rules, we would expect will be the
regulatory event and we're hopeful that that will happen sometime in the first quarter, but that's really up to the
regulators.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Glenn, your line is open.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Sorry about that. The other day, Jamie, you mentioned housing at or near bottom. It's a little
involved question, but curious to see, A) what you're seeing to give you that feeling? And then B) what needs to
happen? In other words, I get that affordability metrics are okay, but there's a lot of inventory out there, underwriting
standards are too tight. There's a lack of agency securitization market; just curious if you can expand on that.
<A - James Dimon>: Let me answer the first part. I think what we need to see is employment. That's what we need to
see because employment, in our opinion will drive household formation. If you look at the other factors, we destroyed
more homes than we've built in the last several years. We added 10 million Americans. We're going to add 3 million
Americans every year for the next ten years, that's 30 million Americans who need 13 million dwellings or something
like that. Household formation has been half what it normally is and most economists say that going to come back with
job creation and the so-called shadow inventory is coming down, not going up.
So for all the chatter about it, it is very high. Rental in half the markets in America, it's now cheaper to rent than to buy
– it's cheaper to buy than to rent. Housing is all-time affordability and my guess is that mortgage underwriting will
loosen, not tighten. If you put all those things together, you're going to have a turn at one point. I don't know if it's three
months, six months, nine months, but it's getting closer.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: In the past when we were going the other way, you were kind enough to give us some
sensitivities around what happens if housing goes down x%. I'm not if you have gotten that optimistic to calculate it,
but how sensitive is the whole balance sheet and earnings sheet to that improvement?
<A - James Dimon>: It was much more sensitive to it going down because we have to take capital losses than going
up where we don't get appreciation. To me, if you have housing get better, our charge-offs will start to rapidly go down
as you see real improvement in the mortgage portfolio and then we won't need all the reserves. So you get both of those
things. We also will have, hopefully, active mortgage markets and healthy economy, and that would be great.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I hear you. Another question is on capital markets related, as we all sit here and struggle between
determining the cyclical versus secular pressure, how do you go about sizing the IB and most specifically, between the
capital charges and potential Volcker changes, how do you think about the inventory businesses which you are so good
in and big in as we sit here and wait for the rules?
<A - James Dimon>: I'm going to put Volcker aside, okay, because that really hasn't been written yet. There are a lot
of things coming out about it. You can come up with a scenario which is not good. I should remind everybody on the
phone that the United States has the widest, deepest and most transparent capital markets in the world and you should
repeat that over and over, particularly when you go to Washington. The widest, deepest and the most liquid; i.e., for
buyers and sellers, very narrow spreads. That's a very good thing, okay?

The beneficiaries of very narrow spreads are the investors of the world. So if you lose liquidity, you lose market
makers, it's going to cost retirees, pensioners, firemen, retired military more money to invest their money. So we need
those things. I think we've got to be very careful we don't destroy that as we try to limit – a fair limit they want to put
on proprietary trading. So at the end of the day, I think we'll deal with that later.
But I think it's secular [ph] is pretty much one of the ones that's (26:37) not permanent. I think that trading – think
about trading this way. We have 16,000 clients around the world. The amount of money that they are going to need to
invest in the next ten years is going to double. Well, I think you have underlying growth. The same kind of underlying
growth you had in the 2000s, the '90s, the '80s, the '70s, the '60s and of course, spreads will change and products will
change and competition will change, and that's pretty good.
So we're going to be in the business. We make markets actively for people. We are very good at it, and those
institutions, 16,000, which include pension plans and governments and corporations, those are required services. You
need to have people making markets so that people can move securities. So you're starting to see a lot of people
understanding that. The volumes itself in the marketplace obviously go up or down pretty dramatically, not just by
quarter, but sometimes by day.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Last one. I just saw a quick quote earlier that you felt the pressures are increasing in Europe. I
think there's a lot of people that feel like some of the liquidity metrics that have been put in place are a good thing. If
you could just comment on that, that would be super.
<A - James Dimon>: I don't know what liquidity metrics you are talking about. I think what I've said is that I think
what the ECB did was a very, very powerful thing, which is extending the collateral and three-year funding. So
powerful, in fact, I think you can probably make the statement it eliminates bank liquidity or funding problems for at
least next year. That's a pretty powerful statement. That was the biggest, single risk of an uncontrollable surprise right
there. So if that's taken off the table, that's a good thing.
Now the banks still have to increase capital so, therefore, they're still reducing RWA, i.e., by not rolling things over.
You can see them selling aircraft loans, trade finance; they're not participating much in revolvers. There are certain
conduits they are not doing anymore. You see them, but that's now just to create capital, not because they have a
funding crisis.
And so look, I think Europe is trying mightily to solve its problems. I still think the likely outcome is they will muddle
through, but the longer you wait, the higher you run the risk of something disorderly that you can't really control. So I
think the ECB took off the worst outcome, i.e., a bank failure.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: All right. Thank you for all that.
<A - James Dimon>: The other thing I'd say and it's quite obvious. I just got back from Berlin yesterday, that
regulatory policy is completely contradictory to government objectives. They should start talking to each other a little
bit.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning, a couple questions. One, on the IB, can we just talk a little bit about how
you're thinking about bidding for some of assets that might be coming out of Europe? I guess I'm trying to understand
where you – where you're most interested in adding to your footprint?
<A - James Dimon>: Yeah, so this is – first of all, most of the assets we have are just – I'm going to call ordinary
course of business to maintain our trading books and credit for clients. So are we going to be aggressively bidding for
assets from over overseas? No, we've done some. You see that the portfolio is up $10 million. Some of that came out of
Europe. But again, going back to contradictory policy, most of us want to get our capital up and therefore, we're not

going to do it. That's the outcome of all these rules, you know, that's life.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: But since last quarter you talked on the conference call about the fact that the capital rules
weren't really that clear. They obviously became a little bit clearer between now and then.
<A - James Dimon>: They're clearer bad. I will give you a very specific example. One security we looked that if you
look at – we believe would have had a 10% cash return and really required some economic capital. Basel III statutory
requirement was 1,200% capital, that's an 8% pre-tax return. 5.5% after tax. We're not going to do it, that's all. Not a
big deal for us. It's not great for the recovery of the global market.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it.
<A - James Dimon>: Remember, that's not just one security. That filters through what people are doing everywhere.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So, on the flip side, interest in low RWA assets, relatively high?
<A - James Dimon>: Listen, we're doing RWA, you know in the budgets at a very detailed level and LCR and all of
that that. So yeah, we're going to manage – we're going to manage at a – really micro-manage RWA. So yeah, there are
assets we're going to put on that we think are very good RWA returns and we'll probably be much more sensitive to
that for now than we would be in the past.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Can we talk a little bit about head count? Because you're one of the few companies where
head count is growing. Revenue environment is still on the tougher side given the rate environment. Can you give us a
sense as to how much longer or what your expectations are for head count, and in addition to that, just where your
reinvestment spending is and do you have to pull back at all at this stage, yes, no?
<A - James Dimon>: No, we're not pulling back. The overhead number, I think we already mentioned that $50 billion
is, I believe, going to be pretty consistent so far for next year and the head count needs to put in three things. We're
always gaining efficiencies, which you don't see in Tech, Ops, overhead, a whole bunch of stuff, and we've added and
we break it out, we've got to do it by business, but branches, so we've added 3,000 salespeople in branches in
consumer, some of that is in the new branches. Some of that is in existing branches. We're adding private bankers.
We're adding branches overseas. We've opened 20 branches overseas mostly for TS&S, so all those things add people,
and the biggest add, which we will not be adding any more, is to handle default. I have got the total number, but we've
added 15,000 people in the last two years, maybe more just to handle default mortgage in mortgage. That number has
probably peaked and I think you will see it coming down in the next couple of years.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Are you talking about people dealing with OREO?
<A - James Dimon>: No, no, not OREO. Well, also OREO, but yes, it's 15,000 to 20,000 just to deal with default
servicing, OREO, foreclosed assets and all that kind of stuff. So those number will I think it's now running--
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yeah, that's the $925 million in servicing expense in that business.
<A - James Dimon>: Which two-thirds is default now. That default number is going to come down over the next
couple of years and the head count related to that, too.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. So that's tied to transaction volume in housing and how you get down – bringing
down your OREO in delinquency. My last question just has to do with the outlook for home prices and transactions. I
know the question was already asked, but I wanted to ask in conjunction to, you know, the PCI impairment that you
took and the reduction in the portfolio there.
<A - James Dimon>: Let's keep it simple. We're still assuming another point or two percent drop across the board in
home prices. We do it by region and stuff like that. If they dropped another...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: So if they dropped – remember we said last quarter 10%, 8% more and you get $1.5
billion increment incremental impact in PCI reserves.
<A - James Dimon>: All things being equal.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right, and so – but you've made a change in your PCI reserves this quarter.
<A - James Dimon>: That's just forecasting lifetime losses.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Great.
<A - James Dimon>: Remember, little adjustments change that quite a bit.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So your outlook hasn't – this doesn't reflect...?
<A - James Dimon>: My guess – I go other the other way. We had almost $9 billion in reserves for mortgages. We've
got $3 billion of reserves for repurchase. Charge-offs are coming down. It's more likely than not we are going to have
excess reserves and this will be reversing. At one point, to me, it will be when the economy gets stronger.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Great, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Ramsden with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Richard N. Ramsden>: Good morning. I've got a couple questions. If we could go back to the LTRO, a couple of
questions. First is does this in any way change your willingness to engage in interbank transactions, i.e., compared to
where we were a month ago, are you more willing to engage in transactions with European banks?
<A - James Dimon>: Again, I talked about contradictory regulatory policy. When I was in Berlin, they were
complaining that no bank banks were lending to other banks. Well, of course not. The banks are penalized for lending
to banks. The G-SIFI charge specifically penalizes lending to banks and the FDIC charges 10 basis points on interbank
lending. There will be no interbank lending ever again. Now, maybe that's a wise policy in the future. That's perfectly
reasonable. It's not reasonable now, but that's what we did.
<Q - Richard N. Ramsden>: The second thing linked to this, do you think this will change the...?
<A - James Dimon>: One point. We do finance banks. We do have some credit out to banks and we do some secured
funding, so we do deal with banks. It's very different than interbank placing where they get unsecured short-term funds.
<Q - Richard N. Ramsden>: The second thing is do you think this will meaningfully change the speed of delevering
of assets coming out of Europe as a result of European banks having such a significant amount of three-year funding?
<A - James Dimon>: I think it reduces the pressure on them, but they have this 9% capital target they have to do by
June. So I think – and you've got to ask them. I think that's what's pushing them to shed risk-weighted assets to get to
that 9%. Most of them are not going to issue equity, nor would I if I were them.
<Q - Richard N. Ramsden>: Okay, my last question is...?
<A - James Dimon>: I would say we have not seen a huge – I mean, some people are expecting this wall of sales, this
wave of sales. We have not seen that. We've seen a more orderly – particularly in trade finance, aircraft, some CMBS
and some RBS, some conduit related business, but it's not a wave, it's just a kind of orderly movement of assets from
one – some banks to others.
<Q - Richard N. Ramsden>: Back in early December, you talked about the possibility of getting Basel III compliant
early, i.e., at the end of 2012, which was a change to what you said before.
<A - James Dimon>: Yeah.
<Q - Richard N. Ramsden>: Can you give us an update both in terms of your thinking on that and second, what
benefits you think you would get by getting Basel III compliant early?

<A - James Dimon>: I think what I said originally – I know we flip-flopped this a little. Originally we said there's no
reason to get there early and then at your conference, I said maybe by 9% by the end of 2012, but we're going to drive it
up. We've just finished CCAR [Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review], the Fed is giving out more guidance that
they would like to see people – the way I am going to word it is make real progress on getting to the 9% – well for us,
getting to the 9.5% by 2018. We're going to do that. It may be not be quite 9%, but we do like our stock and we don't
mind buying back stock. I think you're going to have people getting there quicker rather than slower.
<Q - Richard N. Ramsden>: Okay, thanks.
<A - James Dimon>: People want to get out of the yoke of this thing at one point. We've got to get this behind us. The
good news about the CCAR, in my opinion is, it should, I hope, definitively get rid of this capital issue once and for all.
If banks can demonstrate that at 13% unemployment, a market down 50%, home prices down 20%, a catastrophe in the
U.S. market sales and trading, a catastrophe in European credit and sales and trading and with all that, you're still way
above Basel 1.5, it makes two points. We have got plenty of capital and we don't need more. I think that point will be
quite openly blatant when people release the results of the CCAR.
<Q - Richard N. Ramsden>: Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Yeah, good morning. You talked, you know, we've talked a little bit about some of the
potential impact or the strong loan growth impact that you've gotten from some of the Euro deleveraging, but I guess I
was just looking at the very strong commercial loan growth, wholesale loan growth and trying to get some idea of how
much of that was coming excluding any Euro impact. Just from core customers, either using more on working capital
lines or investing in capital expenditures, and what's your outlook for that continuing?
<A - James Dimon>: Commercial bank is 100% U.S. and it has nothing to do with European banks, and from what we
can see, it is continuing and it's very broad based in terms of clientele, etcetera. It's not utilization. It's new lines of
credit for the most part. I think in the investment bank, the loan portfolio went up $10 billion and now it's about half.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Some of that is.
<A - James Dimon>: About half of that related to...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Conduits.
<A - James Dimon>: Coming out of Europe.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: It sounds like you see a lot of momentum there on the core commercial side continuing this
year?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes. Yes.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Nevertheless, you're saying and maybe you're gaining share in terms of line of credit, but
you're saying you're not seeing an uptick in utilization on the lines of credit?
<A - James Dimon>: Modest uptick in utilization but the reason we don't really know is we added a lot of bankers,
particularly in Florida and California, which is new to us. So we know and we've added – I think it's 2 billion of total
loans came out of those areas so we know some of our growth is the new areas that obviously have some market share
issues, but I think when other banks report, you are going to see good loan growth numbers in commercial bank in the
U.S. Again, look at our numbers, small business, up 52%. Trade finance, up 73%. Investment banking, they're all –
we're starting to see pretty good growth.

shouldn't put that plant in China or Mexico, but we can eliminate the shipping costs back, and we'll put it in the United
States. Is there something like that going on?

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Yeah. First, I'd like to follow up on the last question. When you look at wholesale loan growth,
it was up 37% annualized in the fourth quarter. So it just seems as though there must be some sort of reintermediation
by your bank from the capital markets back to the traditional banking? I mean, how can 37% annualized loan growth be
sustainable? So my question is...?
<A - James Dimon>: It's not. It's not. A big chunk of that, if you take the investment bank loans, which I think that
went from $60 billion to $70 billion, something like that.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's right.
<A - James Dimon>: That bounces all over the place. That includes bridge loans and it does include like $5 billion or
$6 billion of conduits we put in there. We don't expect to see that kind of loan growth every quarter in that portfolio.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: It's still 20% annualized loan growth. I'm trying to understand the flight to quality benefit. Are
people moving business out of the capital markets back to the banks?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: You know, I would say, though, Mike, the other piece...
<A - James Dimon>: No, they're not.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: No. But we had syndicated – and we had record syndicated loan fees so there is a lot of
that activity going on, but you also saw a lot of activity in the capital markets. So people are, I figure, doing both and
we did see some real fundamental growth in the investment bank in terms of the year-over-year stuff, but
quarter-over-quarter, I wouldn't draw a conclusion from that.
<A - James Dimon>: Wholesale line, you're looking at consolidated wholesale, right?
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Right.

<A - James Dimon>: That includes trade financing.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: And CB, and I think actually AM is also included in that number. I mean, we did see
growth across every single one of those businesses quarter-on-quarter.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Still, the more general question, the impact from capital markets to traditional banking, look at
noninterest bearing deposits, they were up $40 billion in three months. That's a 50% annualized growth rate. It seems
like something's happening in terms of people moving at least their money to you if not wholesale loans.
<A - James Dimon>: Right. Wholesale loans, no, other than we've mentioned 5, and maybe it was a little bit more,
billion relating to European loans that we bought or conduits. I don't expect that to continue. It might. That's not a flight
to quality. That's just other people are trying to get rid of their assets.
There's no question in the liability side particularly in large corporates or TSS, you're right, it was up 100...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: $100 billion year-over-year.
<A - James Dimon>: More than 100 year-over-year. My guess is a lot of that was flight to quality. It's very hard for us
to distinguish because some of it is just big money sitting there. Companies are flush with cash and their cash balances
are growing. Some of them are new accounts. We estimate a chunk of that might be that. We don't make a lot of money
on that. So the part or whatever you call the flight to quality or something like that, we're making very little on it. We
almost do that more to accommodate the client.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: One last unrelated question. It seems like RFS keeps having negative operating leverage. I know
you're investing a lot, and I'm sure we'll hear about this at investor day. It seems like an awful big branch build strategy
that's not paying off yet and it's during a period of – when deposits aren't worth as much in low rate environment. Does
that really make sense?
<A - James Dimon>: You've got three completely different things. Obviously our operating leverage has gotten worse
because of regulation, Durbin, etcetera; that's a fact. That's number one.
Number two, we opened branches and I'd say we're modifying that because a lot of these change does affect branch
profitability, but to the extent that we can open a branch and get a very good return, we're going to continue to do it.
Remember, a lot of this is California, Florida, where there's a huge benefit to clustering, i.e., increasing market share
inside local markets. So we are going to modify the size of the branch, location, products and services and – but we're
going to continue to open branch loans. Every time you open a branch, you get a very good return, and the third one
was...?
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Just the low rate environment and the deposits aren't worth as much.
<A - James Dimon>: This is a very important thing. We have decided and you may decide differently and think we're
wrong, but we have decided that the value of the deposits is more and we're not going to treat it like they're very low
for the sake of our business. That value of the deposit will come back and we will regret having not continued to grow
our business as normal. And the profits will go up because eventually margins will go back to more normal types of
things over time. That's a decision we made open to comment or criticism, but as of now, unless someone can prove
otherwise, that's what we're going to do.

<Q - Jason Michael Goldberg>: Thank you. Good morning. When you look at 2011 and obviously first half trading
results significantly stronger than the second half. I guess typically we have seen a seasonal uptick, particularly in the
first quarter of the year, over the last several years. I realize we're very early into the quarter. I guess given all the
macro factors out there, is there anything that leads you to believe that seasonality won't reoccur, or how are you
thinking about that?
<A - James Dimon>: You know, honestly, your guess is as good as ours. Look, we've had a pretty good start so far,
but it's only so many trading days and you know, look, we could be surprised on the upside, downside, who knows.
<Q - Jason Michael Goldberg>: In the release, you point to fourth quarter ROE that was modestly disappointing.
When you think about that, is that, do you think, driven by the macro factors, or there's specific areas that you think
underperformed given the macro environment?
<A - James Dimon>: Well, it was 11% return on tangible common equity, and we would like to be closer to 15%, so
that's all we meant. A big part of difference is there's still a huge drag from mortgage. I mean, you're talking about
several billion dollars a year just in mortgage alone. That drag is going down but it's still a negative and eventually that
will disappear.
<Q - Jason Michael Goldberg>: Got it. Lastly on the third quarter call, you talked a lot about this capital confusion
and I guess earlier this week, you talked about you wanted to buy back equal to or more stock in 2012 versus the $9
billion you did in 2011, and then raise the dividend. I guess, you know, first – two parts. One, do you feel like you have
more clarity on that front? Secondly, it seems like your comments were more leaning towards buybacks than dividends
than maybe they've been previously, so maybe comment on that.
<A - James Dimon>: Dividends is a small decision from capital standpoint. Whether you raise it a little bit here or
there is not material. We started the dividend again, and we would like to increase it a little bit every year.
That's a board decision and the stock is very cheap and particularly below tangible book value and I would like to buy a
lot back, which of course, we can't do. By the time we're allowed to buy a lot of stock back, I'm sure it's going to be a
much higher price and then we may change our decision about that. You can get a little frustration in my – about how
we've had to do our capital buyback.
We're getting more clarity from the Fed. The Fed has asked for these stress tests. All the banks have put in their CCAR,
and we are going to tell you what that is when we get it back. I'm not going to change the statement I made at the
Goldman conference which was, we hope to be able to do a little more than we did in 2011.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it, okay. I wanted to ask a little bit about liquidity coverage and you know, the ratios.
The Fed has indicated that the U.S. banks are going to have to undergo a liquidity stress test on a regular basis. You've
mentioned that your concern...
<A - James Dimon>: Just so you know, most banks I know have always put themselves through a liquidity stress test.
That you should do. This is normal course of thing. It's just they're going to get more involved in how it's designed and
stuff like that. We believe that we should be able to handle a lot of stress and liquidity.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. It's just that you've mentioned when looking at the Basel liquidity rules that
have been proposed that it bothers you that they don't credit some of the advantages that U.S. banks have like the
guarantees on agency securities and the access to the Fed window, and I was just wondering if you believe that you
have been heard on those things, that the Fed will take those things appropriately into account?
<A - James Dimon>: The LCR, and you guys have all seen this, has a huge amount of detail behind it, and we're in
favor of good detail and they got a lot of comments. If Ginnie Mae is at a 15% discount, how come equities aren't in
there? How come gold isn't in there? How come liquid assets? And they got comments that the drawdown on deposits
are too high, and millions of comments. They've acknowledged some of those comments. Let them come back and
when we get the final stuff, we'll tell you.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: The fact you deployed liquidity...
<A - James Dimon>: Some of the stuff in the LCR was absurd. So hopefully they'll be responsive at least to the absurd
parts.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So the fact that you mentioned you deployed liquidity during the quarter and that was one of
the things that helped with the net interest margin. That's not that you're feeling more comfortable with this or what the
Fed is saying? It's just...?
<A - James Dimon>: No, normal balance sheet management.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. From what you know of the Fed liquidity rules if they were, in fact, if they were
implementing their stress tests right now, do you think you would be compliant with what they're looking for?
<A - James Dimon>: I don't know yet. Guy, I don't think it's going to be material to us any which way. If we have to
make some adjustments, we'll make some adjustments.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. Final question that I have is on the non-credit impaired portfolio and the reserve
release there. The mortgage delinquency trends that we can see did continue to improve, but it seems the improvement
is at a moderating pace.
<A - James Dimon>: Right.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more color on what drove the decision to
release and I guess sort of a longer term question would be how to think about – sorry, go ahead.
<A - James Dimon>: It's very simple, okay. You see the numbers. They moderated and maybe there will be a little
improvement going forward and what made us change our minds is the accountant said we had to. I would have left
reserves up if it was solely up to me.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. So in other words, if we were transitioning already into an expected loss versus, say,
sort of a current loss reserve model, you might not have done it?
<A - James Dimon>: Look, that's another question. I like having – eventually we have a $9 billion reserve we won't
need. Until we get through all this uncertainty, I would rather have them up. Basically, the numbers have gotten too
good over time to leave up that amount of reserves under current accounting. There is going to be a change in
accounting, but that's not – we'll worry about that when we get there.

<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Guy, if you just do the math and you say 877, you multiply it by 4, so call it 3.6. We
still, after that, have $8.7 billion worth of reserves up for that portfolio.
<A - James Dimon>: One of the things in the stress test, not just for us but for a lot of banks is, the portfolios are
smaller, we have got a lot more reserves up and a lot of the bad stuff is run through so loss rates won't go up as much –
I'm talking about in a real stress test and you won't need to add as much to reserves from where you were a couple
years ago.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Following up on the earlier comment that the NIM percent might be down a little bit in
the first quarter. If we think about the net interest income dollars, should we see continued growth off of this level?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yeah. I mean, it should be flat to up. Again, that's a function of deposits, and it's a
function of loans and we expect both of those to continue to trend if the world stays the same.
<A - James Dimon>: By the way, I just got a note that one of the newspapers out there thinks that we haven't done a
full disclosure on Europe. The reason we didn't add a European bit, it is pretty much like it was last quarter. Not much
has changed, if anyone's interested.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Just a flat to up comment, is that for the first quarter or just and if you are growing
loans consistently throughout next year, it seems like you could have an upward trajectory throughout the year.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Matt, if that's the case, we should have an upward trajectory throughout the year.
Remember, again, one other thing, that's net loan growth. We did tell you we're going to have portfolio run-off in home
lending and that's going to impact NII on an absolute dollar basis by about $500 million, and the mix will change but if
trends continue where they are, yes.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. Separate topic, mortgage put-back continues to grab some headlines here. Can
you just clarify and remind us what portions the FDIC is covering related to WaMu? I think there was some debate
whether the private label is covered and the GSE is covered. You can clarify that?
<A - James Dimon>: Two things. The GSE put-back number, that's the $350 million that we had, those numbers are
basically timing differences like $3 billion in reserves. We don't expect a real change in that and some of that, there
were pieces of that that were settled relating to WaMu, and I forgot which one, whether it's Fannie or Freddie.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That number, Matt, that's a fixed dollar amount, and we're working through that and
would expect to be through that in 2012, and so and then on the private label side, there's not confusion on our part. We
do not believe we have repurchase liability for the private label claims from WaMu.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: From the outside, though, how do we know what the verdict from that is? What should
we be following?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's going to work its way out in the courts.
<A - James Dimon>: Litigation. We put up a lot of reserves for litigation.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay, lastly sticking with the litigation theme, the merchant suit against Visa and
MasterCard and the banks, there's a court date scheduled for September and it seems like there will be potentially some
sort of settlement and any thoughts you have how it might impact credit card interchange or upfront settlement charge?

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning. Jamie, I just wanted to follow up on a comment I thought you made in
terms of capital in terms of perhaps not aggressively trying to move toward the 9% Basel III number by the end of
2012.
<A - James Dimon>: I'm sorry, what's the question?
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: I'm wondering if what you said before focused on maybe not trying to aggressively reset
9% Basel III tier 1 common number by the end of this year?
<A - James Dimon>: Look, I don't want to give you quite a number yet. It may not be 9% but it will be 8.5% or
something like that. We are going to make a lot of progress toward getting to the 9.5%, and my guess is we'll be at the
9%. We could get to the 9.5% right away. It wouldn't be that hard to do if we just wanted to do it and I don't think it
would be good policy to help with an economic recovery but my guess is we'll be at 9.5% by the end of 2013.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: That's fair. Just following up on your comment on the no material change in your
European exposures, I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on some of the commentary that the regulators have
made about potentially seeking greater clarity across the U.S. banks in terms of their disclosure and whether or not that
might change some of the disclosure that comes out of the regulators as well?
<A - James Dimon>: No, I think we already disclose a lot of what they – what the SEC said people are going to
disclose, right, and there's very little to add. For us, it's not a lot different than we show. I think other people didn't
show that kind of detail. You will get more detail.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Matt, you should expect to see the slide that Jamie put up at the conference in
December, and that will be in our filings.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Great.
<A - James Dimon>: With a little more detail.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: With a little more detail and we may add some additional countries to that, but that's
sort of the level of disclosure we're expecting from the – for others to have as well.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: That would be helpful, and then just one final question on the investment bank. It looked
like Asian revenues were down about 47% quarter-over-quarter, even though loans were up about 14%. Dough, was
there anything going on there? Was there anything particularly especially this quarter or last quarter that drove that
decline?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: No, there really wasn't. The capital markets are a big part. Equity in particular of our
Asian business and those were very challenging in the quarter. You know, if you look at ex-DVA which actually had an
impact there, it was a little – smaller decline and year-over-year revenues internationally for the bank were up a couple
billion dollars and a much larger percentage, almost 24% of the total revenue up from about 21%.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Has your outlook for Asian contribution to overall IB revenues in 2012 changed
materially over the last quarter or so?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: I don't think our outlook has changed, but again, it's going to be in part a function of the
markets and how open they are for business.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you, good morning. Can you give us some color on your branch expansion strategy? I
know you outlined it last February. You will probably update it for us on this February but then you changed in the
third quarter. Where does it stand now in terms of branches?
<A - James Dimon>: It's exactly what I said in the third quarter. There's a page that you can go get from that
presentation I made at Goldman. There is about 175 branches and we're looking at things like size and technology and
locations, but we're still going to be opening branches, particularly in California and Florida we need more share.
There's nothing mystical about it. We have to adjust it. Some of the regulatory changes made certain branches less
profitable, et cetera, that's all.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Is there a possibility – since your deposit market share doesn't exceed 10% of the total
U.S. deposits, which would prevent somebody from buying another bank, but the too big to fail doctrine seems to be
weighing on your bank and a few others. Do you think you could, if M&A comes back, could you guys buy
depositories in the U.S.?
<A - James Dimon>: First of all, we have to get rid of the too big to fail thing. I think companies have to be allowed to
fail and therefore, we need to help show people the resolution is real. And so you are going to see us be making a little
bit of an effort on that by how can you dismantle a big bank in a way that doesn't damage the taxpayer or the economy
in any material way, and we're still under the 10% cap.
I think there would probably be a political fire storm if we tried to buy someone in the United States. If we thought it
was really, really good for shareholders, we would want to do it and we would be willing to have a little mud on our
face, but we need regulatory approval. So if we can't get regulatory approval, then we're not going to try.
Counter to all this chatter about too big to fail, the United States is the least consolidated banking market in the world
and there's still too many banks and unfortunately, some – all of these regulatory things are tougher on smaller banks
than bigger banks. So you are going to see a lot of them wanting to sell or merge.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Finally, on your outlook for Durbin, the $600 million, the impact, is that the incremental
impact from the fourth quarter or is that the total impact that's already reflected in the run rate in the fourth quarter?
<A - James Dimon>: It's reflected in the run rate in the fourth quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Thanks, guys. I want to circle back on Guy's question earlier on asset quality. I just want
to understand how we should think about kind of remaining credit leverage, you know, as things seem to be turning,
credit card has been a big driver in terms of the reserve release nearer term, but that seems like it's going to start
moving higher in terms of losses. How do we think about the degree of reserve release that might be able to come out?
<A - James Dimon>: I think in credit card we're near the end of reserve release if that's what you're referring to.
Credit is very good and hopefully it will stay good. It may get a little better, but I think we're near the end. In terms of
mortgage, I think we already mentioned of the $9 billion, one day you won't need all that, but we need more – far more
improvement in charge-offs, delinquencies and all that, before that reserve will come down.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: And Jamie, I'd add on the repurchase reserve front, I have got $3.6 billion there, that's
another number that over time should come down materially.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it, thank you. Then on commercial wholesale, should we expect incremental build for
the growth that you're seeing, or how should I think about that?
<A - James Dimon>: We're close to steady state now in most of those areas – strong reserves but steady state. If we
grow, you are going to have a little build. All things being equal, which they're not, but yes.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Thanks. Just a ticky-tack question, in the investment banking detail, you had mentioned
that part of the credit portfolio results of the loss of [ph] 31 (1:03:59) this quarter related to DVA losses, but they were
offset by NII and some fees but also CVA. How much was the CVA this quarter?
<A - James Dimon>: Net CVA was very small. So in a steady state, that line called credit portfolio would be a couple
hundred million dollar positive. Of course, if you look at it, it bounces all over the place because of CVA and DVA
effects.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Great. Thank you.

Your next becomes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Hi, guys. Most of my questions have been touched on. Just a quick one here. On the $569
million headwind from the change in MSR valuation, can you discuss the impact that HARP 2.0 had on that?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Not much. There was a little bit.
<A - James Dimon>: There were a lot of things in there: home prices, pay-down rates, how we look at – what kind of
required returns we need on the MSR itself, the option adjusted return. So there were large model updates which had a
lot of pluses and minuses.

benefit there in market share or what do you expect in 2012, any pickups?
<A - James Dimon>: Well, what I have seen – not really, okay? There are more announcements than actions and
today, I guess, it was RBS who said M&A and equity is going to stay in fixed income. So we haven't really seen it. If I
would ask the traders, they may have seen a little bit. But eventually, there will be some people exiting some of those
things and you know those who remain will probably pick up a little share because of it.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Just one other question. On the long-term debt, it was down $17 billion in the quarter after
being pretty stable for the prior three. Is that just a function of the markets weren't conducive to rolling over debt, or are
you looking to actively to reduce that over time?
<A - James Dimon>: No, it's just a function of our own funding needs.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Should we expect that to go down, or is it just going to bounce around with your balance
sheet?
<A - James Dimon>: I think you should not really expect it to go down.

Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. Jamie, you talked about the regulatory response being different once you get
to 9.5%. Could you talk a little bit about how would you see that relationship, you know, kind of once you got to the
level that you thought that you should be at?
<A - James Dimon>: Yeah. I guess my point is I think a lot of people want to get past all this and go back to – look,
we should always have stress tests and liquidity and stuff like that but when the rules are known, we shouldn't be
guessing about what we want to retain in capital and how fast you want to get there and what the requirements are and
what the phase-in is, so all that uncertainty should be eliminated. Here are the rules that banks have to live by, that's all.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Just on the mortgage front, given we've had yet another one of these ideas that the settlement
with the AGs is imminent, could you talk a little bit about how you see things kind of developing then and could that be
a trigger for some of that reserve release that you're talking about or what would it take, do you think, other than this?
<A - James Dimon>: Unrelated, okay. It is still imminent. It would be nice to get it done but there are still open issues
and we've been working mightily to try to get it done, because I think it would be better. I think it would be good for
the mortgage markets to move on. I think that anything that can get resolved is better for the mortgage markets, but it
has nothing to do with reserves and – though it will affect numbers. We will have to account for whatever the
agreement is and we've already done some of that, so there will be some adjustment because of it, but it won't really
affect reserves that much.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: And I guess given your...?
<A - James Dimon>: Let me say, it's embedded in the reserves and it will probably have no major net effect.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Got it. Given your relative optimism on housing, are there things that could be done to help
the down payment piece? That seems to be the last piece that's really hard to kind of bring to the table.
<A - James Dimon>: Look, if it were up to me, I think that someone in authority should convene all the people
involved in the mortgage businesses and – because this could be fixed. It's three years after the crisis. There is virtually
no RMBS. We don't know the skin in the rule games. Foreclosures are being held up everywhere which is damaging
the economy. You can blame the banks, but it's damaging the economy. These things can be fixed. You have much
more – mortgage markets and underwriting is still tight. I think underwriting will probably loosen over time. It's tight

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Bove with Rochdale Securities.
<Q - Richard X. Bove>: Hi. In looking at what's going on in Europe, it's really hard to understand how these European
banks will ever meet the Basel III requirements in the short run. So I'm wondering if there's a real possibility that this is
going to be pushed out in the United States also a year or two years and whether definitions are going to be changed to
make it a lot easier to deal with these rules? In other words, I simply cannot conceive of how this thing can go into
effect in Europe and I'm wondering how it can go into effect in the United States if it doesn't go into effect in Europe?
<A - James Dimon>: Let me add to your confusion here a second. We're running Basel 1, Basel II, Basel 2.5, and
Basel III. Remember, the European banks are already on, in effect, Basel 2.5. They just to go from 2.5 to 3 where the
American banks have to go from 1 to 3, so when they've got to get to 9%, it's not tier 1 common, it's tier 1 core, which
is slightly different. By June of 2012, that's an accelerated getting it ready. They've already got most of Basel III in that.
Maybe I'm a little wrong on that. I think most of Basel III is already incorporated in Basel 2.5.
It's put a lot of pressure on these banks in Europe who – look, they in the past have over-leveraged, they have too much
unsecured funding, but they've operated under that scheme for a long time, sanctioned by the states and you know this
is why I say it's completely pro-cyclical what is being caused in Europe right now and so will it change? I don't know.
Will that change what American regulators want to do? I don't think so.
<Q - Richard X. Bove>: The risk weighted asset definitions seem to be a lot different in Europe than they are.
Companies like Credit Suisse have a 20% risk weighted asset to total asset ratio. In addition to which, in looking at
liquidity is Nestlé really a worse credit than Greece? Doesn't all that stuff have to be resolved before they go forward
with any implementation of Basel III?
<A - James Dimon>: Yeah, but I've got to leave that to them. We've got to run our business here. I do think it causes a
lot of confusion. If you speak to banks in Europe, they are – they may think a lot will get done now. They know it's
pro-cyclical and they think some of the stuff is silly, but I'd let them tell you what they need to do about it.

<A - James Dimon>: I can just mention about Europe, by the way, like I said, I was in Berlin yesterday, and it's quite
clear when you speak to like the ECB and they did the three-year funding, they're why banks aren't making loans and
buying sovereign debt. It's a huge arbitrage. You can earn 4%, 5%, 6% and finance it at 1%. If you ask the banks,

they're saying I can't buy sovereign debt because I'm already being criticized heavily by other regulators, you know,
about my sovereign debt and my exposure and I've got to get all those numbers down. So over there, it's quite clear that
regulatory policy, government policy, central bank policy, it's not coordinated. It's making the situation worse not
better.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Thanks, Jamie.
<A - James Dimon>: Basically, there is no one in charge of the global financial system. If you look at the
inconsistencies and the counter-cyclical things we're doing, it's crazy. It's not the way to get a recovery going and I
don't expect it to change, by the way. So we're going to run our business the best we can.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Jamie in that regard, wondering the ECB seems to be constantly easing its collateral standards.
What are the risks that you might worry about in that regard as they keep easing their standards to provide liquidity as
the banks have to meet the requirements that you've referred to?
<A - James Dimon>: Well, look, I think the ECB did the right thing because when the banks and when everyone is
questioning sovereign debt and everyone is questioning unsecured debt and everyone is questioning wholesale debt and
everyone is questioning – the banks had to get funding. What is the ECB supposed to do, let them not get funding?
<Q - Ron Mandle>: No, I agree with you that they're doing the right thing so far, but that brings its own risks that's
possibly at some point down the road that is what I'm wondering about.

around the world. I don't know how to say it, I've said it a hundred times, I'm not complaining. JPMorgan will be fine,
but that's what we're doing. No one is really in charge of putting these things together and realizing the negative effect
it's causing.
We can get through it all, just it's going to make it more painful and slower. We all want jobs this is not job creating.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer and Company
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Oh my goodness, after Jamie's exegesis on regulators, my question is going to seem so
mundane. But you gave us a nice disclosure on the breakout of the mortgage servicing expense between core and the
default expense, and I'm looking at that $3.8 billion default related expense. Is there a way to game what that number
would be if mortgage – when delinquency rates ultimately return to 50 or 100 basis points?
<A - James Dimon>: The default piece will be close to zero.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: The ongoing – Chris, the ongoing servicing number is call it a couple hundred million
bucks a quarter.
<A - James Dimon>: That will stay.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That will stay.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Right, okay.
<A - James Dimon>: I think we put a slide out somewhere else that actually showed what will remain. It will come
down quite a bit, but not all the way.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: All right, and then just a clarification on your dividend buybacks – share buybacks. Last
March you announced a $15 billion multiyear repurchase program of which $8 billion was for 2011. That was
subsequently bumped up to $9 billion. Theoretically $6 billion remains. Do you have clearance to do that in the early

part of this year, or do you have to wait for the CCAR?
<A - James Dimon>: The CCAR is what will allow us to – we're going to be told what we can buy back in terms of
stock or not. We've applied, so we'll get a response on March 15. So you'll know on March 15 what we know. Forget
what's open.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's a board authorization and obviously we'll address the board authorization.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: The board, not Fed.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Right, that's a board authorization and we'll adjust it to whatever we're announcing in
March.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: All right. Then I'd just turn it back to Jamie to see if he wants to share any thoughts about
the regulators.
<A - James Dimon>: Please, don't take – I'm not talking about the regulators; I'm talking about the inconsistent policy
between certain regulatory policy, certain government policy and the so-called objective to get the economies of the
world going again. Those are inconsistent. You guys should write about that. They are inconsistent and it's too bad.

Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning. A little bit about regulatory inconsistency. Jamie, would you just speak to
the Fed's sort of white paper on the mortgage market that came out a couple weeks ago and then Governor Rankin
came out and blasted the mortgage servicers and said that principal write-downs remain on the table, et cetera, et
cetera; what's going on with the Fed?
<A - James Dimon>: Look. I don't know; everyone wants to get the mortgage market healthier, and I think the Fed in
that white paper also showed that costs are higher than they should be. The mortgage costs, if you reduce the mortgage
costs, the spreads over 10 years and stuff like that could be – I forgot the number, 30 or 40 basis points cheaper. I agree
with them.
That's not going to happen if you can't foreclose on homes. It's not going to happen if you don't have RMBS. So it's
more of a – you need a holistic approach to get it all done. I think the Fed is right that there should be a holistic
approach. We put in the press release that we've offered 1.2 million mortgage modifications, okay, and that we've
actually completed 400,000, and that we're making 765,000 mortgages a year. With all due respect, we're making
mortgages all day long. We're selling them to the GSEs. We want to be in the business.
On the servicing side, mistakes were made. They're being fixed. We're paying for them and we should. We should pay
for the mistakes we made, but let's keep the mortgage market active. I mean, you did you see Ally said they're not
going to do mortgages in Massachusetts anymore because of certain litigation there and stuff like that. That's not a
good thing.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: My second question would be you mentioned share repurchase quite a bit in your
comments...?
<A - James Dimon>: I also don't agree that somehow principal forgiveness would be the end all to be all, okay. There
are 75 million homes; 25 million don't have mortgages. Of the 45 million or so with mortgages, 4 million of those
mortgages are having problems and we're working through those. Those who can't afford to stay in their home, the
loans in effect would be written off and forgiven, okay. And millions of mods are being offered. All the banks do it as
aggressively as they can and all the banks have geared up trying to handle just the raw amount of defaults and stuff like
that. We support HARP 1; we support HARP 2; we supported HAMP and we're doing our own mortgage modification

on top of that.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - James Dimon>: And we want to see a recovery in the housing markets. We would do anything we can to get a
recovery in the housing markets.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Did you regard the white paper as helpful? The commentary that came after it seemed
distinctly unhelpful.
<A - James Dimon>: Look, I don't remember the commentary that came after it. I think some of the things in the white
paper were interesting. If I were the powers to be, I have already said this, I would convene all the people involved in
the business. I would close the door. I'd stay there until we resolved the [ph] budgeting (1:20:07) issues so we could
have a more healthy mortgage market. I think if you had RMBS, if you finish skin in the game, if you changed reps and
warranties, if we figured out how to deal with seconds and firsts – you could fix all this if someone was in charge. No
one is in charge.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay, I want to ask about – you've mentioned share repurchase several times today, but not
– you haven't mentioned dividends so much. I mean is this – do you see an extraordinary situation right now in your
stock price where this year dividend would take a back seat to share repurchase because of the stock price?
<A - James Dimon>: Look, I don't know. Look, when we started – I'm very consistent that we hope to do a little bit of
increase every year. That's what we hope to do. When the board talks about it, they're going to decide what that number
is. I don't think it's that critical to our company. You're talking about small numbers relative to all these other things.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura. Brian, your line is open. It seems that question
has been withdrawn. Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Yes, good morning. Chris Wheeler wfrom Mediobanca here. A question on risk
weighted assets under Basel III if I might. I think if I remember rightly, you were talking about uplift of about $180
billion from Basel 1 to Basel III. Of that $180 billion, I wonder if you can give me some flavor as to – that's from
mitigation, sorry. How much of that mitigation has already been achieved because obviously we can't see that given
you are still reporting on Basel 1?
Perhaps a flavor for what the nominal asset value is behind that? And then also perhaps what timetable you've set
yourselves in terms of running that off as you move towards obviously getting there sooner rather than later. And then
finally perhaps, how much of that is going to be active and how much of that is going to be passive mitigation?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: So the numbers today are about $300 billion in uplift and what we've said is we're
going to bring that number down it's really going to be two things. One is we just have natural portfolio run-off across
the businesses and that's going to reduce RWA.
<A - James Dimon>: Without doing anything.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: And the second is there is just model implementation and that's again, just literally
inputting the data that's required in order to have a somewhat different treatment than the standard. That's going to just
take time. We are going to do that over the next two years and you'll see that roll through the numbers over the next
two years.
<A - James Dimon>: It is normal modeling. It's nothing special. It is normal modeling that was expected in Basel III
that we just haven't built yet.

<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Sorry. I'm getting a bit confused here. You're saying $300 billion of uplift is your
expectation?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: No. There is 300 billion of difference today. The Basel 1 numbers to Basel III.
<A - James Dimon>: Just start Basel III. Basel III is 1.5 trillion. It's coming down how much?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: It will come down over time another 100ish billion dollars.
<A - James Dimon>: Right, and part of it is model and part of it is run-off.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: You're saying virtually none of that is going to be active? It's by model and it's by...?
<A - James Dimon>: We will actively do stuff, too. Believe me, we'll very actively do stuff.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Sorry. What is – give me a rough idea what the nominal is behind that because that's
one of the intriguing factors here. You touched on that earlier.
<A - James Dimon>: Behind which one?
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: The nominal behind that $100 billion of run-off of risk weighted assets? As you were
talking earlier about 1,000% uplifts on some of the RWAs you – or some of the assets you were looking at earlier, I
wonder what the nominal was behind that $100 billion of mitigation?
<A - James Dimon>: Let's do this again. We're going to do this for a last time. We are running off, is it $100 billion of
RWA? It is loans or high RWA assets that we're not going to regenerate again that are going to run off the books.
There's nothing we need to do. That includes high RWA loans. It includes all these mortgage loans that are running off.
Then there are models which we're just building which are normal modeling and stuff like that we're allowed to put into
Basel III which will do another whole chunk of reduction of RWA. Do you have the chart right there?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: I do, the total of those two is about $100 billion.
<A - James Dimon>: Okay, $100 billion.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: I don't know the exact. We can get back to you on the exact nominal dollar amount, but
a lot of it is in the mortgage portfolio so it's pretty close to that number.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay. That's much clearer. Thank you so much.
