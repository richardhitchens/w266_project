MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for standing by, and welcome to Accenture's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016
Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer
session with instructions being given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call will be
recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host and facilitator, as well as our Managing Director, Head of
Investor Relations, Ms. KC McClure. Please go ahead.
KC McClure
Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2016
Earnings Announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor
Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David
Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth
quarter and full fiscal year. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our
business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2017. David will then take your questions and provide a
wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as
such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to risk factors set forth in

today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other
SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this
call.
During our call today, we reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in
our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to hear more about our very strong results for both the
fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Given some travel limitations, I'm not able to be with you here in Boston this
week, so David and I decided to prerecord our remarks and then we will be available to take your questions at the end
of the call.
Let me start by saying how very pleased I am with our excellent financial results for both the quarter and the year. I'm
particularly pleased with our durable and balanced performance. We have now delivered double-digit revenue growth
for two years in a row and we have gained significant market share.
Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered very strong new bookings of $35.4 billion. We generated record
revenues of $32.9 billion with 10.5% growth in local currency. We delivered earnings per share of $5.34 on an adjusted
basis, an 11% increase. Operating margin was 14.6%, an expansion of 10 basis points on an adjusted basis. We
generated very strong free cash flow of $4.1 billion. We returned $4 billion in cash to shareholders from share
repurchases and dividends and we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share, a 10% increase over
our prior dividend.
So we delivered an excellent fiscal year. I feel very good about our performance and the momentum we have in our
business, which clearly reflects the value of the services we provide to our clients each and every day.
Now let me hand over to David.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call. We were extremely pleased with our results in
the fourth quarter which once again reinforced our distinctive position in the marketplace, especially as it relates to
being a leader in partnering with our clients to rotate their business to the new including Digital, Cloud and Security.
By any measure, our fourth quarter capped off what has been another truly outstanding year for Accenture, which is
even more impressive when you consider that our fiscal 2016 results followed an equally strong year in fiscal 2015.
At a high level, our quarter four results continued to reflect strong performance across all three of our financial
imperatives: durable revenue growth faster than the market, sustainable margin expansion while investing at scale in
our business and our people, and strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation.
To be more specific, quarter four represented our 10th consecutive quarter of strong growth with continued significant
gains in market share. Our net revenue growth of just over 9% in local currency was broad-based and balanced across
most dimensions of our business. Our operating margin of 14.1% came in as expected and up 20 basis points from
quarter four of last year. We were especially pleased with the underlying drivers of profitability which enabled us to
invest significantly in our business and our people during the quarter.
And we delivered strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.9 billion, which supported our ongoing objective of
investing in our business while returning significant cash to our shareholders. So we finished the year in a manner

which was very consistent with the previous three quarters, with strong broad-based growth underpinned by very good
profitability and cash flows.
With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the detail, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9
billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0, and outsourcing bookings were
$4.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were pleased with our new bookings in the quarter, which came in as we
expected and reflected continued strong demand for digital-related services. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $35.4
billion in new bookings, reflecting 7% growth in local currency.
Turning now to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 9% in local
currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 1.5%. Revenues were approximately $40 million above
the upper end of our previously guided range when adjusted for the actual foreign exchange impact. Consulting
revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, up 11% in USD and 13% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.9
billion, up 4% in USD and 6% in local currency.
The trends in revenue growth across our five businesses were very similar to last quarter. Strategy and Consulting
Services combined as well as Operations posted another quarter of double-digit growth while Application Services
delivered very solid growth in the mid-single digit range. And across those four businesses, we saw strong double-digit
growth in the new led by digital-related services.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups, Products led all operating groups with 18% growth, reflecting continued
double-digit growth across all industries and geographies. Our significant growth in Products reflects the rapid adoption
of the new across all of the industries within products and our investments over the past few years are serving us very
well in meeting the new demands of our clients.
H&PS posted another strong quarter with 11% growth driven by continued double-digit growth in Health and overall in
North America and the Growth Markets. Financial Services grew 9% in the quarter driven by strong growth in both
insurance and banking and capital markets as well as positive growth across all three geographies led by double-digit
growth in Europe.
Communications, Media & Technology growth landed consistent with our expectations at 5% and reflected continued
strong overall growth in North America and the Growth Markets. In Europe, we did see contraction driven primarily by
Communications. Finally, Resources growth was flat in the quarter as we continued to navigate cyclical headwinds in
both energy and chemicals and natural resources. We continue to be very pleased with double-digit growth in utilities,
which is benefiting from clients' investments to digitize their businesses.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.3% compared to 31.7% in the same period last
year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.7% for the fourth quarter last year.
General and administrative expense was 6.1% compared to 6.2% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was
$1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.1% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter four
last year.
In the fourth quarter, as part of launching a joint venture with Apax Partners, we closed our Duck Creek transaction.
This transaction, along with an immaterial adjustment to finalize our gain on the divestiture of Navitaire, lowered our
quarter four tax rate by 1.8% and increased net income by $249 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.37. The
following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.1% for the fourth
quarter last year. Net income on an adjusted basis was $881 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of
$788 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.31 compared with EPS of
$1.15 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 14% year-over-year increase.
Days services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 37 days in the fourth quarter last year.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net
of property and equipment additions of $160 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $4.9 billion compared with

$4.4 billion at August 31 last year.
Turning to some other key operational metrics, we ended the year with a global head count of about 384,000 people.
Utilization was 92% compared to 91% last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 16%, up
1% from quarter three and up 2% from the same period last year.
With regards to our ongoing objectives to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or
redeemed 5.6 million shares for $640 million at an average price of $114.52 per share. At August 31, we had
approximately $5.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
As Pierre mentioned, our board of directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.21 per share. This dividend will
be paid on November 15 and represents an $0.11 per share or 10% increase over the previous semiannual dividend we
declared in March.
So before I turn it back over to Pierre, I want to reflect on where we landed for the full year across the key elements of
our original business outlook provided last September. I'm extremely pleased that we continued our track record of
successfully executing our strategy and managing our business to deliver on the business outlook we provided at the
beginning of our fiscal year.
Net revenues grew approximately 10.5% in local currency for the full year, well above the top end of the guided range
that we provided at the beginning of the year. Growth was strong and balanced across our operating groups,
geographies and businesses. We were very pleased with double-digit growth in Products, H&PS and Financial Services
as well as overall in both North America and Europe.
From a business perspective, we posted double-digit growth in Strategy and Consulting Services combined as well as
Operations, with very good mid-single digit growth in Application Services. And of course, across the board, we saw
double-digit growth in the new, estimated to represent approximately 40% of our revenues for the year, led by
digital-related services with estimated growth of approximately 30%.
Operating margin was 14.6%, a 10-basis-point expansion over fiscal 2015 adjusted operating margin and within the
range we provided at the beginning of the year. Importantly, we were very pleased with the scale of our investments in
our business and our people as we created additional investment capacity resulting from improvements in our
underlying profitability.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $5.34, reflecting 11% growth over adjusted FY 2015, and was above the upper
end of our original guided range, primarily driven by our strong top line growth. Free cash flow was $4.1 billion, above
our original guided range and reflecting a free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 1.1. And finally, we delivered
on all of our capital allocation objectives by investing over $930 million, primarily attributed to 15 acquisitions, and
returning $4 billion of cash to shareholders.
So again, following a very strong year in fiscal 2015, our leadership team and employees around the world have done it
again with another truly outstanding year. These results demonstrate the durability of our growth profitability and cash
flows and our ability to manage our business to deliver value to all of our shareholders.
Now, let me turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David. Our outstanding performance in fiscal 2016 demonstrates that our growth strategy continues to
resonate with our clients, and that we are clearly executing very well. We have benefited from the actions we have
taken over the last few years: to align Accenture around five distinct businesses; to transform the services we offer; and
to increase our investments in new and high-growth areas. This is all about driving differentiation for Accenture and
making us the most relevant professional services company to lead in the new digital world.

Our five businesses: Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and
Accenture Operations are each highly competitive in their own right, as well as synergistic in delivering value for our
clients. Today, the range of capabilities we provide end-to-end is truly unique in the marketplace, from being relevant
in the board room to delivering cutting-edge technologies, digital solutions and innovative platforms to operating
services on behalf of clients to drive tangible outcomes.
At the same time, we have transformed the services we offer, rotating our business rapidly to what we call the new
digital cloud and security-related services, which together accounted for about $13.5 billion or 40% of total revenues in
fiscal year 2016. That is a substantial increase from approximately 30% of revenues just a year ago.
Let me show a few examples of how we are helping clients onboard the new. In Digital, we are working with Meliá
Hotels, the European hospitality company, to implement a digital transformation strategy to increase sales across all
channels through data-driven customer segmentation. In just one year, direct sales up 27% and more than 1 million
people have joined Meliá Rewards program.
In cloud, we are helping Rio Tinto, the global mining company, transition its enterprise systems to the private cloud,
including the world's largest SAP production system migration to Microsoft Azure, delivering increased agility with an
as-a-Service model. And in security, our cyber experts are working with a large U.S.-based utility to define, develop
and run the next-generation security operations center. We are developing a comprehensive strategy to accentuate,
manage identity and enable [indiscernible] (18:38) for cyber threat in real time.
We continue to make significant investments across our business and are securing acquisitions. In fiscal year 2016, we
invested more than $930 million of capital in acquisitions, and that is on top of about $800 million last year. And when
we look at these last two years, I'm delighted that about 70% of our investment in acquisitions have been in the new. In
the fourth quarter alone, we announced five acquisitions in the new, including three digital services companies:
MOBGEN in the Netherlands, Tecnilógica in Spain, and dgroup in Germany; and two security companies: Maglan in
Israel, and Redcore in Australia.
We continue to see strong demand from our clients for large-scale mission-critical transformation programs. The broad
range of services we provide across our five businesses, together with our deep industry expertise, continues to
differentiate Accenture. And we remain the partner of choice for the world's leading companies. For Stryker, the
medical technology company, we are helping transform its business operations to enable more growth and agility. We
are leveraging the Accenture/SAP Business Solution Group to build a solution on S/4 HANA, spanning finance, sales,
logistics, supply chain and procurement.
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business, I'm delighted that we delivered another year of strong and
balanced growth around the world, with double-digit revenue growth in local currency for the second year in a row in
both North America and Europe, as well as in many of our largest countries. In North America, we delivered 11%
growth in local currency, driven by the United States, where we have now delivered double-digit growth of five years
of the last six years. In Europe we grew revenue 11% in local currency, with double-digit growth in the U.K., Italy,
Switzerland, Spain and Germany, as well as high single-digit growth in France. And in growth markets, we grew
revenue 8% in local currency, driven primarily by double-digit growth in Japan as well as strong double-digit growth in
China, India, South Africa and Mexico.
Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on our ongoing imperative to drive innovation across our
business and to create cutting-edge solutions for clients. In today's fast-changing environment, where companies need
to continually reinvent themselves, we are increasingly taking an innovation-led approach to drive more value for our
clients and help them invent the future. Our approach to innovation spans everything we do, from Accenture Research,
where we identify the market and technology trends; to Accenture Ventures, where we invest in growth-based
companies; to the Accenture labs, where we incubate and prototype new concepts through applied R&D; to Accenture
studios, where we build innovative solutions for clients with speed and agility.
Our unique approach with the Accenture innovation architecture enables us to combine our capabilities across the
company to invent, develop and deliver disruptive innovations for clients and install them faster. So, as we enter fiscal

year 2017 we have momentum in our business, and you can count on us to continue to invest and build our capabilities
for the future and to also deliver strong durable and profitable growth.
With that, I will turn the call over to David, who will provide our business outlook for fiscal year 2017 and then take
your questions. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. David? Over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thanks, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect revenues to be
in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.65 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about flat compared to the first
quarter of fiscal 2016 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency.
For the full fiscal year 2017, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume
the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal 2016. For the full fiscal 2017, we
expect our net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal 2016. For operating margin,
we expect fiscal year 2017 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 basis point to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal 2016 results.
We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. This range includes an estimated benefit of
less than 2% from our early adoption of a new accounting standard on employee share-based payments. For earnings
per share, we expect full-year diluted EPS for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.98, or 8% to 12% growth
over adjusted fiscal 2016 results.
Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal 2017, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to
$4.9 billion; property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million,; and free cash flow to be in the range
of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income. We expect to return at least
$4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares
outstanding by slightly more than 1%, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our
shareholders.
With that, let's open it up, so that we can take your questions. KC?
KC McClure
Thanks, David. As Pierre mentioned, David will be taking your questions. I would ask that you each keep to one
question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide the
instructions for those on the call, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO. Please go ahead.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Hi.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Keith.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Good morning, sir. Thank you very much. Very strong results indeed, particularly in
the climate that we're in. The operating margin performance for the quarter – or for the year is what I wanted to ask
about. This – for FY 2016, you guided to 10 basis points to 30 basis points. You came in at the lower end of the range.
What were the circumstances, you think, that contribute to that? And as you look to the guide, which is similar of 10
basis points to 30 basis points operating margin expansion, what are the forces, you think, that would cause some
influence in that outcome, or are you thinking more about the low end of the range again? And just any color on that.

Thanks very much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Right. Thank you for the question. As you've heard Pierre and me say several times over the
last, really, couple of years, we are at a period that really calls for us making a significant level of investments in our
business to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and to also position ourselves for long-term market leadership
beyond just the year that we're in. And when you look at the 10 basis point to 30 basis point range, that's a range that
we feel very comfortable that we can deliver within. And I would say that the swing factor generally, and it was the
case this year, was the extent to which we invested in the business. And as you know, just doing the simple math, the
difference in 10 basis points is about $35 million.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Right.
<A - David P. Rowland>: And so, when you look at this year, we were very pleased with the overall level of
investments that we made in the business. And it was that marginally higher level of investments that we made. To be
clear, our investments were significantly higher. I'm talking about on the margin even a little higher than they otherwise
would have been, which resulted in 10 basis points versus 20 basis points. So, it's simply a reflection of the fact that
we're managing a large investment pool in the business.
And on the margin, an additional $35 million one way or the other is the difference between, let's say, being at the low
end or the upper end. But we are quite pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion. We created significantly more
expansion in our underlying profitability in order to fund really a material level of investments overall. So, we are quite
pleased with that dynamic in our results, if you will.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Okay. Great. Then my follow-up, if I could, related to that is, perhaps I missed it, but
I don't know if you said how much you're contemplating that M&A would contribute to this year's guidance?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, good question. I don't think I said it in the prepared remarks, but the answer is about
2%.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Okay. Many thanks. Best of luck.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey. Good morning, Sara.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: So, last year you started out at 5% to 8% constant currency revenue growth and ended
up above 10%. As you look to fiscal 2017, I'm trying to get a sense of what could drive your revenue trend to be at the
lower end of the outlook and perhaps what could drive it above. And if you could talk about your expectation for digital
revenue growth in fiscal 2017 in the new, that would be great. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Right. Thank you. Well, let me just take a minute and just frame how we see the
environment and then how that relates to our guidance. I think, first of all,, and I don't think it's a surprise to anyone on
this call, in balance, we see the overall macro environment being more volatile, let's say, at this time than where it was
a year ago, entering fiscal 2016. So, we see a higher level of volatility overall in the macro environment for the reasons
that this group understands very well. Having said that, in that context, our guidance assumes that the market growth,
and when I'm reference market growth, I'm talking about the basket of publicly traded companies, we expect for
purposes of managing our business and the outlook that the market growth is going to be very similar in 2017 to what
we saw on 2016. And in 2016, to be clear, we saw organic growth in the basket of publicly traded companies of about
2.5%.

Now just to pause on that point for minute, that means that in 2016, we had an extraordinary result of growing roughly
three times the basket for the full fiscal year, which is really tremendous and a reflection of the power of our strategy
and our capabilities and the relevance of the work that we're doing with our clients. The overall basket, including the
inorganic, grew at about 4.5%. So, the market environment that we see is organic of 2.5%; overall growth, let's say, of
4.5% in that range. Now, offsetting that, so a higher risk profile in the macro, the market growth as I called out, is the
fact that we're starting this year with a high level of confidence. We continue to see strong momentum in our business,
and that's a reflection of the things that we have done very uniquely in positioning our business for the market of today
and the market that we see in the future.
When you look at what we've done, organizing around five distinct businesses that can operate and do operate as
leaders in their own right individually but also can come together to do transformational work for our clients in a highly
differentiated way, when you look at the extent we have invested in rotating our business to the new, meeting those
new and emerging needs of our clients, all of that grounded in our innovation and grounded in our significant industry
differentiation through our operating groups and the skills we have there, all of that continues to come together in a
powerful way, and we're very comfortable with the momentum that we have going into the year.
All that translates into 5% to 8% growth. As always, the range represents what we think is the full range of
possibilities. We always work hard every day to be at the upper end of the range. Across the entire range, it would be
higher than market growth, and we would gain share. And if we were to land toward the upper end of the range, that
would continue to be about double the rate of the market growth, which would be quite a strong result. So, hopefully,
that gives you the context in terms of how we see the market and our guidance.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: Great. And then within that digital and the new, how are you expecting those to grow
given difficult comparisons but strong momentum?
<A - David P. Rowland>: We see both of those continuing to grow at strong double-digit growth. They will grow
significantly higher than the average of Accenture overall. As we said, last year, I believe, I think I've said either on this
call or I Day, is that while we are very confident in our positioning in the new and the three components, from a
planning standpoint – or from a guidance standpoint, it's not prudent for us to assume that it's going to grow 30-plus
percent again one month into the year. So, we have, let's say, a more practical view, but yet still a view of strong
double-digit growth at this point, and has the market opportunity – to the extent it becomes a higher level of growth
similar to what we saw this year, then we'll ramp up our capability and meet that need just as we did in 2016.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey. Good morning, Tien-Tsin.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Good morning. Thanks, David. Just a follow-up to Sara's question, I guess, why might this
year be different in terms of what you might deliver relative to your guidance? It sounds like – a lot of confidence, as
you said. Macro is more volatile, but maybe the starting point is similar. Can you comment maybe on visibility, or
anything that might differentiate this year versus last year based on what you see?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, as we start the year, maybe – let me answer that through the lens of our five operating
groups, and that might be helpful...
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Okay.
<A - David P. Rowland>: In terms of what might be different. If you look at our five operating groups against the 5%
to 8% range, at the top end of the spectrum, if you will, you have Products, which is the operating group that is
Company Name: Accenture
Company Ticker: ACN US

positioned for the strongest level of growth. And we think it's likely that Products would deliver a level of growth that
is above the range of 5% to 8% and really continue to lead the way for the growth in Accenture. Now, will it be as high
as it was in 2016? I don't think anyone would expect us to assume a repeat of 18%, but yet it will continue to be very,
very strong.
On the other end of the spectrum we have Resources. And Resources is really doing a brilliant job navigating what
continues to be a very difficult environment. We do expect to see continued pressure, if you will, in energy and
chemicals and natural resources. I would say no different than what we saw last year. We also continue to expect
Utilities to be a very strong performer for us but, on balance, when you net that together we think it's likely that
Resources is going to be below that 5% to 8% range. Still flat to positive growth, but below that range.
And then in the middle, we have Financial Services, H&PS and CMT. And while we continue to expect strong growth
for those three operating groups in that band of 5% to 8%, for different reasons, the growth will be, let's say, lower than
the strong growth that several of those operating groups delivered in 2016. Still very healthy growth, mind you, and
growth that represents taking share in the case of all three of those. But at this point in our guidance, we're not
assuming that those three operating groups would deliver above the 8%.
So, when you say what's different, with Products, it's more of the same, maybe not quite as strong as it was last year.
Resources continues to have the headwinds with the two verticals in particular. And then the other three operating
groups, we see right in that zone. And by the way, I think I might've said 18% for Product. I meant to say 15%. I
misspoke on that. So, they were 15% for the year.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Got it. No, that's helpful. So, maybe just as a follow-up, just to follow through with that, just
thinking about the Consulting versus Outsourcing for fiscal 2017 or maybe just broadly speaking, strategy versus, say,
Application Services operations, any sort of help you can give us there, David, on what that might look like?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I would say that when you look at – through the consulting outsourcing lens first, for
the type of work lens, we see the Consulting being in high-single-digit growth, at the high-single-digit level, so
continued again very strong growth above the market, taking share. We see outsourcing as a type of work in the
mid-single digit to high-single digit. And those two combined support the 5% to 8% range.
I think probably more interesting is to talk about it through the dimensions of our businesses. We see Strategy and
Consulting combined in the mid-single-digit to high-single-digit range. And again that would represent very strong
growth in that segment of the market. We see Application Services in the mid-single digit range. We see Operations in
the high-single-digit to low-double-digit range. And again in the new, as I mentioned, we see continued strong (sic) [we
see strong] double-digit growth across all three components but, let's say, led by digital-related services.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: All right. Good stuff. Really appreciate it. And, Pierre – it was good to hear Pierre's voice.
Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yep. Thank you.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Thank you.

<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey. Good morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hey, David. How you doing? Just wanted to ask, last quarter, you guys warned of European
financial service weakness on the horizon, but it was actually a strength in the quarter. I think it grew double digits. So,
just curious on your outlook there in Europe financial services. And maybe just in general, a lot of headline risk in
financial services these days. How do you see the environment going forward for you guys?

<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. First of all, let me say we were quite pleased with our growth in financial services in
Europe. We have a very strong practice. We have strong leadership, a great team broadly. And I think it just speaks
again to the differentiation that we have, in this case, in financial services Europe, and the extent to which they are
really bringing the full power of our strategy to serve our clients which have a variety of needs.
I think, if I remember correctly, Pierre focused on a few demand drivers in financial services that continue to be present
in the fourth quarter, and we believe will continue to be present going forward. I mean, the first demand driver – first of
all, the backdrop is, I think, as we know, financial services is a very technology intensive sector, especially if you're
thinking about banking and capital markets specifically. Within that, I would say the three demand drivers continue to
be significant investment in digitizing the customer channel. So, what the sector refers to as distribution and marketing.
There's significant investments to digitize the channel as a way to drive growth in the bank.
Alongside that, for reasons that we understand, there's significant focus on cost rationalization and increasing to a much
higher level the cost efficiency of the bank, both to deal with, let's say, the structural pressures of a lower interest rate
environment, regulatory pressures, et cetera, but also to create capacity to invest for the growth through digitizing really
the enterprise but especially the channel.
And then a third driver would be risk and regulatory broadly, where we have market-leading capability, and that serves
us very well. So, when you look at the fourth quarter, all three of those things were at play globally but certainly in
Europe. And we think we're well-positioned, and we think that banks, in spite of these disruptive forces, continue to
have the need to invest in transforming for profitability and investing for growth. And we are well-positioned to help
them with that.
When you look at the backdrop of Brexit, specifically, in Europe, we have not seen any material impact to date. We
didn't see that in the fourth quarter, and we don't see anything in the first quarter. Having said that, we, along with
everyone else, continue to be very focused on it. The Brexit story, if you will, will play out in the months, if not years
to come, and so we watch that very closely. We're not blind to the fact that, that could represent some risk. And we're
working hard to anticipate those, should they occur and then respond accordingly.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Helpful. And then just quick follow-ups. The lower tax rate, is that sustainable going
forward, or is that just a one-year impact? And then just any thoughts on gross head count for the year? Thanks so
much and congrats.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you very much. The tax rate – the accounting change for the tax rate for share-based
compensation gives us a benefit, because effectively, we get a higher tax deduction when the share price at the time that
a share is delivered is higher than the price at the time that the share was granted. And so, in this environment, where
we've had such strong appreciation in our share price, that created the tax benefit, which as I called out was just under
2%.
So, to answer your question, will that continue over time? It will continue over time to the extent our share price
continues to appreciate such that our share price at the delivery date is higher than what it was at the time we granted.
And so, you can take the point of view on where you think our share price will hit, and then that would inform you as
to whether or not, that would benefit us going forward.
On the head count, was the second part of your question. For – as you look forward to next year, there is an interesting
evolution, if you will, and how we talk about head count even externally. And really, as you think about our focus on
these five distinct businesses, each of which has a unique talent strategy and supply/demand model, it's a little bit – it's
more nuanced, if you will, in terms of how we communicate head count related data. And so, what I would say in
general is that we have a history of hiring to meet the demand that we see in the marketplace. We do it very effectively.
Our utilization for many, many quarters has been managed really at industry-leading levels. And so, as we look
forward, our head count is going to evolve in a way that meets the demand that we see in the market. And what we take
comfort in is that we think talent management and our ability to access talent in the market is as good as anyone in our
industry. And we feel very confident that we will secure the talent in the quantities we need to support the growth that
we provided for in our guidance.

Our next question will come from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey. Good morning, David.
<Q - David Mark Togut>: Good morning, David. Could you address your strategy to reinvent your core and rotate the
core towards digital security and cloud over time? And in connection with that, are there any milestones we can track
just to measure your progress in this strategic transformation?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. So, that's a very good question. I'm glad you asked it. And so, when you use the word
core, just to level set everyone, you're referring to that portion of our business that is not in the roughly 40% we
identify as in the new. So, you're talking about the 60%. And I think the important point to make there, and Pierre has
made this point several times previously as well, is that our investment agenda and our innovation agenda covers the
full scope of our business, including the 40% that we identify with the new and the 60% that we identify outside of the
new. So, again, we have a very vibrant business outside of that which we identify as being digital, cloud or security.
So, the point is that we do invest to maintain vibrancy in our core business, and our goal, just as it is in the new, is to
grow our core faster than the market and take share. If you look at the year that we just completed, we estimate that our
core grew – had positive growth, albeit at the – in the single-digit – low-single-digit range, as by design the vast
majority of our growth comes from new, which is the essence of our strategy. But nonetheless, our core business
continued to grow. And we estimate that it grew faster than the market, and we took share. And we invest for that
growth, and we focus on it as a key part of our business.
An example of that would be something that, again, I think, Pierre has referenced, Bhaskar Ghosh, who leads
Technology, has talked about this in different forms. But an example of that would be the investment that we've made
in our myWizard platform, which fundamentally reinvents, if you will, innovates around the way we do core
application services work through the use of a automated tool that includes an intelligent agent or agents, in the case of
this tool, and really just helps us deliver application services work in a way that is more efficient and more effective.
When you look at, for example, some of the investments that we've made in our Strategy and Consulting business,
while our Strategy and Consulting business is focused on the new, consistent with our strategy, there are parts of our
strategy and consulting business that are not in that bucket that we call the new. When you look at the investments that
we make in that part of our business, for example, the acquisition that we just announced of Kurt Salmon, which gives
us an industry-leading strategy capability in the resale sector and really strengthens our position there. Certainly, a part
of that investment benefits us in the new, but there's a part of that investment that is the core strategy capability in retail
that is part of the 60% that we benefit from as well. So, we invest in both parts of the business, and in both cases our
intent is to be a leader, to grow faster than the market and take share.
<Q - David Mark Togut>: Thanks very much, David. My thoughts are with Pierre.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Great. Thank you, David.

<A - David P. Rowland>: Good.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Good morning, David.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: All right. First one, can you give a little bit of color around how – where you're seeing the
maturity of some of the digital service lines at this point, now that as you highlighted they're $9.5 billion in revenue?
Meaning is there any way to broadly characterize the digital work into build or design type of work versus where
you've moved into full implementation or even ongoing run activities?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good question, and I have to say thanks for not asking me the margin question first. You'll
ask me [inaudible] (50:08) I'm sure. So, Lisa, what I would say is that when you look at the maturity curve for the new,
and I think this applies to Digital. It applies to each of the three components within Digital that we talk about,
Analytics, Mobility and Accenture Interactive. It applies to cloud adoption and it applies to Security. I would say across
the board, universally, we are on the low end of the curve, if you will, or to say differently, we are in the early innings
of the adoption curve. And so these are waves that we think have a lot of runway in front of them. Paul Daugherty
would give you a more eloquent view as our Chief Technology Officer, our Chief Technology Strategist.
But I feel comfortable that he would say that certainly this is a decade-long, if not beyond a decade-long, adoption
curve for these new technologies, and really the profound impact that they will each have on the way global businesses
and governments operate. And so I would say we're early stage in the adoption, and this wave has a long runway in
front of it.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Okay. And then as a follow-up, just maybe coming at the momentum question from a little bit of a
different angle, why is it that you think – at least the splits you were giving tend to suggest that you at this point believe
your growth may decelerate into this year even though, as you highlighted, it's still meaningfully higher than the overall
market growth? Given the momentum, though, you're describing and the fact that these are in the early stage of
adoption and the new is an increasingly large component of your base, why would you think the business would
decelerate this year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, it's – again, I think you have to look at – you have to look at the fact that – I want to
make sure that in the way I answer that question that I start with the fact that we feel very good about the momentum in
our business and we feel very good if we were within the range that we guided to and that would represent, we think,
market-leading performance.
Now having said that, why would it be different? And I don't want this to sound negative because, in fact, we're very
positive. But when you think about month one of the quarter, and when you think about the operating groups and the
industries that have had really extraordinary double-digit growth, in many cases not only for the last year but for the
last two years, as confident as we are in many of our industries, as we sit here in the first month of the year, to assume
that all of those industries in all of those geographic markets are going to continue at the same level of extraordinary
double-digit growth for a third year in a row, would just – probably wouldn't be prudent.
Now does that mean that we don't have confidence in our industries? No. Does that mean that our business runners
aren't working hard every day to hit the repeat button and do again what they've done in the last two years? Absolutely
not. But Pierre and I have a responsibility to be balanced and prudent in the way we set our expectations externally, and
that's what's reflected in our guidance.
And again, that's not to say that our guidance is conservative in any way because we don't. We think it's very good
guidance in the context of the market growth and it's entirely consistent with our strategy to be a leader and grow faster
than the market. But if some of these industries have strong but let's say lower growth than they've had the last two
years, then that would put us in the 5% to 8% range and that is the possibility in several of our industries.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Terrific. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Rod Bourgeois of DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey. Good morning, Rod.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Hey. Good morning. Hey, David. Hey. So I just wanted to clarify a couple of things that
seem to be assumptions in your guidance. If I understood your comments about the verticals correctly, it sounds like all
of the verticals except energy could be somewhat weaker in its growth in fiscal 2017 versus 2016. And energy has been
challenged, so it'd probably stay somewhat challenged, but the other verticals it sounds like will decelerate.
And then you also mentioned that you're assuming the market rate of growth will hold up in fiscal 2017 at the same rate
as in fiscal 2016. And so I just wanted to one, clarify, is that the assumption about the verticals that they'll generally be
somewhat slower this year than last? And then on the market, I just want to understand the assumption that it will – the
growth rate will hold up at its current level. What's driving that assumption?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, so I'll start at the end and then work back. What's driving that assumption is that we
don't see anything as we sit here today that would fundamentally change the dynamics that we see in the market, let's
say as we look out over the next four quarters. We see more of the same, and what we see is an organic market that
would continue to grow in that 2.5% range, which means that we are making our own market through our
differentiation, the uniqueness of our strategy, leveraging the power of our investments to drive a level of organic
growth that is meaningfully higher than that to take share.
But we don't see anything that would meaningfully change that underlying organic growth of about 2.5%. So in other
words, we're not speculating on – you pick your black swan of the day – we're not speculating on some black swan
event that would materially change the market. If that were to happen, all companies will be revisiting the impact of
something like that should it occur.
In terms of the – again, I almost hate to use the word deceleration because in almost all cases our growth ambitions for
the vast majority of our verticals continue to be quite strong and well above the market, albeit at lower levels than, in
many cases, the very, very strong double-digit growth we've had the last year, if not two years. And so deceleration,
what I would say for many of our verticals, we've assumed lower but still strong growth is the way I would characterize
it.
Energy and chemicals and natural resources, we don't see a catalyst for change. We think those industries are going to
continue to be tougher, let's say continue to be tough as we go through the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we have seen
some pressure in Communications in Europe in particular. And although we are very pleased with our growth in
Financial Services, in banking and capital markets specifically, I would say that is an industry that we are watching –
through Richard Lumb's leadership – we are watching very, very carefully and very closely.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: All right. Very helpful. And two very quick ones. You mentioned acquisition contribution
should be around 2% this year. Could that be 3%? And then can you just comment on your DSO outlook?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, so the 2% would align very closely to an assumption that we spend about $1 billion,
which is what we've assumed in our capital allocation strategy, if you will. Could it be higher? As Pierre and I have
said, we have the willingness and the courage, if you will, and the capacity, the firepower, to spend more than $1
billion should we have the right opportunities. And if the right opportunities presented themselves, then we have no
reservations, no concerns and complete flexibility to go above $1 billion if the circumstances were right. And so in
theory, could it go higher? It could go higher and we'll just have to see how the year plays out. A lot of it has to do with
the timing of when those would occur.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Great. And then...

Operator
All right. Our last question will come from the line of Mr. Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead, sir.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey, good morning, Darrin.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: All right. Morning, David. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick follow-up. First on the
hiring efforts, can you give us a little more color on the distribution in terms of GDN versus on-site. Just given where
you're investing in Digital, I would imagine it's more distributed towards the on-site but how much has that changed
over the past year? And then I just have one more quick follow-up.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I would say that – I mean just in terms of color, I would say that we are investing in
talent acquisition in literally in every major market that we have around the world. When you look at our five
businesses, you can connect the dots and see where we have more – higher growth, let's say, in Strategy and
Consulting, as an example, but not just limited to Strategy, Consulting and Digital, I might add. Certainly, a lot of that
talent acquisition investment is in each of the markets that we operate in around the world.
I would also point out though that GDN also supports and is very integral, very integral to a big part of the new. And so
we are investing in differentiated skills and, obviously, in Cloud and Security, in Digital, in the GDN as well. But
again, we're very comfortable with our ability to acquire talent and to ramp that up as we need to as the market growth
evolves throughout the year.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay. And just for my quick follow-up, it really did sound like from the gist of all the questions
on the call that – I know your answer is that you really are not seeing any sentiment shift around the Financial Services
vertical just yet post-Brexit or anything else from a macro standpoint hitting it just yet. I know you're – look, you're
growing over a larger base so it's understandable to be a little more prudent on outlook, but is that a fair statement that
while we've heard a lot of your competitors calling out more conservatism or shift in strategy by their clients, you guys
