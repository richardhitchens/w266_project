Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Andy, and good morning everyone; and thanks so much for joining us today on what I know is a very busy day
for all of you. I'd like to make a few comments about the quarter, comments on the FX legal issues that we're facing,
and then turn it over to Todd for a deeper dive into the numbers.
The headline for our quarter is solid C and net interest revenue growth and 200 basis points of positive operating
leverage. Sequentially, we've certainly faced difficult market conditions which have resulted in lower revenues. But we
were able to manage expenses down despite higher litigation, legal and severance costs.
The result was earnings per share for the quarter of $0.53 or $651 million. That's an improvement of 4%
year-over-year. Revenue was up 8% year-over-year. The fact that we achieved the growth notwithstanding the macro
environment, low interest rates, the continued aversion to riskier assets, and the lack of structured debt issuance reflects
the strength of our business model. Fees were up 9% as we benefited from new business, net long-term asset flows and
increased foreign exchange revenues. In addition, DR has had a particularly strong quarter as certain corporate actions
for some clients moved up to the third quarter versus the fourth quarter.
Net interest income was up year-over-year and sequentially, driven primarily by higher client deposits. Our loan loss
provision was actually a credit of $22 million. And we remain very focused on containing expense growth and bringing
down our run rate. It's one of the things we can control in this very challenging environment.
Now we're taking – we're undertaking a number of actions to achieve what I call operational excellence, a term that
brings together the concepts of improving efficiency, reducing risk, and delivering the highest quality and service to
our clients. And we'll talk more about this at our investor day next month.
Now looking at our two major businesses on a year-over-year basis, Investment Services fees were up 11% with issuer
services, benefiting from the seasonal strength in DRs I mentioned earlier. We had strong new business activity in our
Clearing businesses and asset servicing was also up as we grew assets under custody to almost $26 trillion. Investment
management fees were up 5% as we had yet another quarter of positive long-term asset flows.
In terms of capital, we generated $718 million in Basel Tier 1 common equity. We deployed approximately $620
million of that to a combination of share buybacks and dividends. Our Tier 1 common ratio came in at 12.5% and we
delivered a return on tangible common equity of 22%.
So to summarize the highlights of the quarter, year-over-year revenue growth was solid. We generated positive
operating leverage and managed expenses down sequentially in the face of legal headwinds. Our balance sheet remains
strong and extremely liquid, and we continue to generate significant levels of capital and are committed to controlling
our expenses in a challenging environment.
Now before handing it over to Todd, I want to comment on FX litigation. As you probably saw in our open letter and
various publications, we feel very strongly that the lawsuits against us are unwarranted and flat-out wrong on the facts
and the law. While we will be pragmatic in our approach to resolving these matters, we feel compelled to defend our
reputation. We truly believe we have provided a valuable service at a fair price and, therefore, will not be coerced into
paying huge sums for no wrongdoing.
We are very engaged with our clients to help them understand the issues. Some of our clients are, of course, frustrated
that they need to explain what's going on to their superiors and Boards, but we are answering their questions, allowing
them to explain to their constituents how the service provides real value at competitive prices. The overwhelming
majority of our clients and the investment managers who act as their fiduciaries understand the standing instruction
service very well. They like the service and they know it provides them with vastly better pricing than they could get
anywhere else for what are essentially retail size trades.

Now, I just returned from our asset servicing conference where I met with our Client Advisory Board and a large group
of clients. They are very appreciative of our outreach to them and the value that our standing instruction program
provides. We continue to work with them to innovate our products and services to meet their needs, including
developing additional options for our foreign exchange execution service. We are committed to continuing to be a great
service provider to them.
Importantly, even in this noisy period, our standing instruction volumes have increased over the past two years, which
we think is very telling. Now although the lawsuits may take some time to resolve and it is very frustrating for all of us,
we are confident that we have the legal high ground and that we will prevail.
So with that, let me turn it over to Todd to get into the numbers.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald. As I take you into the numbers, my comments will follow the quarterly earnings review beginning on
page 2. The highlights on a year-over-year basis: earnings for the quarter of $0.53, up 4%. We benefited from net new
business, the seasonally higher depositary receipts revenue, and also positive operating leverage.
Now we had to manage through a pretty difficult market conditions. The S&P, for example, is down 14% during the
quarter and we also saw a period where rates continued to decline. In face of that, we also absorbed higher litigation
expenses and legal costs and a charge related to the change in executive management.
Looking into the specifics, total revenue was $3.7 billion. That's up 8%. Non-U.S. revenue hit a new record for us at
39% of the total revenue. Our core fees continued to grow nicely. Investment services fees were up 11%. Again, a lot
of that was driven by the depositary receipts revenue; as well as net new business, which was partially offset by higher
money market fund waivers – fee waivers. Investment management fees were up 5%, benefiting from net new business
and higher average equity markets, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers as well. Net interest revenue
was up 8%, largely reflecting the growth in client deposits as well as growth in the securities portfolio.
Non-interest expense increased 6% and that was due to higher litigation expenses, increased variable expenses in
support of revenue growth, a $22 million charge as a result of change in executive management. Overall, our increase
in revenue combined with a lower expense growth rate resulted in 200 basis points of operating leverage.
Turning to page 4, we will call out some metrics that will help explain the underlying performance. For example, you
can see that assets under management and assets under custody both grew year-over-year, primarily reflecting new
business. Assets under management were up 5% year-over-year to $1.2 trillion with long-term inflows of $4 billion in
the third quarter and $76 billion over the last 12 months. Long-term inflows have benefited from strength in fixed
income and equity indexed products. Short-term outflows for the quarter were $15 billion and that's consistent with
what we've seen in the industry trends.
Assets under custody was up 6% year-over-year to $25.9 trillion and that's driven primarily from net new business.
Assets under custody decreased only 2% sequentially despite the much deeper decline in equity market values and
that's because we benefit from net new business as well as an increase in some of the fixed income values.
Most of our other investment securities metrics continue to show positive trends. The broker-dealer collateral
management book continues to grow as collateralized lending is growing globally. The major drivers of our clearing
business improved substantially year-over-year as we've brought on significant new business. And total debt service
and deals administered within corporate trusts showed a bit of sequential growth for the first time in a while.
Turning to page 6 of the earnings review, which shows fee growth; asset servicing fees were up 7% year-over-year,
reflecting the positive impact of net new business. Asset servicing fees were down 5% quarter over quarter, reflecting
seasonally lower securities lending revenue as well as the impact of lower equity values.
Over the past 12 months, we've won an incremental $1.1 trillion in new assets servicing AUC. Issuer services fees were
up 21% year-over-year and sequentially due to the seasonal spike in corporate actions in our DR business that normally

occurs during the fourth quarter. Both increases also reflect net new business, which was partially offset by lower
revenue in our Shareowner Services and Corporate Trust businesses.
Clearing fees were up 18% year-over-year due to net new business, growth in mutual fund assets, and a 29% increase
in daily average revenue trades. That was partially offset by higher money market fee waivers.
Clearing fees were up 2% sequentially, reflecting higher cash management balances and an increase in DARTs, which
were partially offset by higher money market fee waivers also.
Investment management fees, as I mentioned earlier, were up 5% year-over-year. Sequentially, investment
management fees were down 6%, primarily reflecting lower period end and average equity market values and higher
money market fee waivers, partially offset by net new business.
For the quarter, FX revenue totaled $221 million; that's roughly 6% of our total revenue. FX revenue increased 38%
year-over-year; that's reflecting increased volatility and higher year-over-year volumes. FX revenue was up 20%
sequentially driven by higher volatility and there were steady volumes on a sequential quarter basis.
Other trading revenue was a loss of $27 million and this compares to a loss of $14 million the year ago quarter and
revenue of $38 million in the second quarter of the year. This sequential decrease was primarily driven by a $40 million
net impact of wider credit spreads on the credit valuation adjustment that we recorded in the third quarter of 2011.
Regarding our FX activity, I would note that Standing Instruction revenue continues to make up roughly 40% of the
total FX revenue. I think it is also worth noting that Standing Instruction volumes have increased over the past two
years, demonstrating the comments that Gerald was making that the value our clients see in this FX trading option.
Investment in other income totaled $89 million, which was down by $8 million from a year ago and down by $56
million from the prior quarter. The sequential decrease largely reflects lower gains related to loans held for sale
retained from a previously divested bank subsidiary. Both decreases also reflect mark-to-market losses on our seed
capital.
Many of our businesses continue to be impacted by increased fee waivers due to lower rates and shortened maturities in
the money market funds. For the quarter, money market fee waivers, and this is the impact I'm about to discuss is the
impact of revenues, increased about $50 million year-over-year and $24 million sequentially. Market conditions have
driven waivers to the levels that we experienced – the highest levels we experienced back at the end of 2009, and that's
about $0.05 a quarter for us.
Turning to page 8 of the earnings review, NIR was up $57 million versus the year-ago quarter and it was up $44
million sequentially. Both increases were primarily driven by the significant growth in client deposits, which we
invested in short-term low yielding assets, as well as an increase in the Investment Securities portfolio. Average
non-interest-bearing client deposits increased $30 billion, or 71%, versus the prior quarter and are more than double
what they in the year-ago quarter.
The interest margin was 1.3%; that's compared with 1.41% in the prior quarter. The decrease was driven primarily by
the increase in client deposits I just mentioned, but it was partially offset by the increase in the Investment Securities
portfolio. If the balance sheet had been stable, we estimate the margin probably would have been up slightly.
Turning to page 9, total non-interest expense increased 6% year-over-year and declined 2% sequentially. The third
quarter included $80 million of litigation expense and a $22 million charge as a result of the change in executive
management, as well as lower M&I cost. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher incentives and variable
expenses in support of revenue growth as well as higher legal costs, and they were offset somewhat by a state
investment tax credit. The sequential decline in expenses was driven by compensation business development and a state
investment tax credit. So we are pleased our expense numbers in the quarter declined 2% despite the – some of the
higher litigation and severance costs as we've been talking about.
Page 10 details our Tier 1 common capital generation and capital ratios. We generated $718 million in new Basel Tier
1 common. Most of that was through earnings. We deployed the majority of that through a combination of dividends

and share repurchases. I'd like to add that in the third quarter our share repurchases totaled $462 million. I'd
characterize that total as much higher than our average, driven by the market conditions in the third quarter.
Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was 6.6% at quarter-end; that's unchanged from where we were in
June. The combination of the higher buybacks – for example, we bought back over 460, and our buyback rate had been
at about 320, as well as the higher risk-weighted assets that was driven by the much larger balance sheet cost us about
25 basis points. So as we've said in the past, we continue to expect in a more typical quarter to grow the ratio by about
20 to 30 basis points.
On page 11 you can see that our investment securities portfolio continues to perform well. The value of the portfolio
has improved over the second quarter and the pre-tax net unrealized gain in our securities portfolio increased by $93
million to $863 million. Pay downs on the sub-investment grade securities were approximately 300 during the quarter;
$300 million.
Looking at our loan portfolio, you'll see that the provision for credit losses was a credit of $22 million. This compares
with a similar credit in the third quarter of 2010, and we had a zero provision in the second quarter. The credit and the
provision this quarter resulted from an improvement in the performance of the loan portfolio and a decline in criticized
assets. Non-performing assets declined from $351 million to $344 million, and the total allowance for credit losses
decreased $37 million. That's a combination of the credit and the $15 million of net charge-offs.
The effective tax rate was 29.7% and that's in line with the previous guidance that we had given you.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, given the accelerated corporate action seasons in DRs, Investment Services will
likely not realize the seasonal benefit that we typically experience during the fourth quarter and probably see a decline
in revenues. This should be partially offset by performance fees in our Asset Management business. We also expect it
to continue to generate NII at the level we did in the third quarter; and fee waivers should run at about the level of the
third quarter. The quarterly provision should be in a range of zero to $15 million. We continue to expect to do buybacks
and that will be based on market conditions. And the tax rate should be approximately 30%.
Finally, as a reminder, I'd like to let you know that we will be hosting our investor day on November 14th. Three things
that will actually be focused on: the first is the strength of our business model; the second is opportunities to generate
above market revenue growth in these challenging environments; and finally, some of the key initiatives that we are
going to be implementing to drive operational efficiencies.
With that, let me turn it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Todd, and I think we can open it up to questions.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi. Good morning, Gerald. Good morning, Todd.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: I'll just open, helpful commentary on the foreign exchange and litigation, Gerald. I know this
remains a process with customers, et cetera, but was just wondering your thoughts about – I mean, hear that the
standing instruction net FX revenues are improved but how are you thinking about just potential turnover amongst
fuller asset servicing relationships? What's the level of concern that you might have some broader attrition over time?

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Howard, thanks. We haven't seen any attrition in the clients certainly over the FX matter. If
anything, as I said in my opening comments, we've see standing instruction volumes hold up and increase. There has
been a more rapid increase in the negotiated trades and I think that's just reflective of the market in general where
everyone's negotiating tighter pricing on everything they can do. But it's not impacting our ability to continue to service
our clients and win new business.
We've had a very extensive outreach program to our clients. You would expect it of us. It's part of good client service.
We're explaining the service over and over again to them and giving them good talking points for the constituents they
have to interface with: their Boards, their managers, their trustees, whatever the case may be. So we think we've given
them not only good ammunition in terms of explaining the service but, once again, providing a very valuable service at
a very fair price for retail trades.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Thanks. That's helpful color. And then switching gears, maybe one for you or Todd,
just on capital management. Given the current environment and the capital that you're generating that you know to
Todd, was just hoping to get your thoughts on capital process from here. We're hearing different things from some of
the big bank management teams this quarter on the capital planning process so was just hoping to get your evolved
thoughts.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. Our capital planning process really hasn't changed, Howard. We put through an
annual budget, we make a plan, we share that with the directors. We stress test it and we then share that with the
regulators. We continue to generate capital at about the rates that we had estimated that we would. We feel particularly
comfortable; 6.6 might sound a bit light but if you add 250 basis points for sub-investment grade securities that we've
marked down to fair market value and they're now actually worth more than where we marked it. And if we actually
were to write them down to zero, our capital would actually increase. So we feel very comfortable with where we are
with the generation and our ability to continue to redeploy capital. We especially like it with our stock price where it is
today.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Thanks. And would there be any appetite to potentially sell those securities and
accelerate share repurchase or do something else with that capital?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes, we're certainly not wedded to those securities. As circumstances change, if the
risk/return relationship on those securities or if there's any reason that we would want to do something with that capital
that's basically parked there, we would. But at this point we don't feel a need to accelerate to meet a Basel III ratio that
really hasn't even been determined what it is yet when we have such strong ratios under Basel I. But it's something that
we could always consider.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Howard, just a quick comment. It is yielding a good economic return to us right now and it
gives us enormous flexibility on the capital ratios going forward so it is something we continue to look at.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Understood. Thanks. And then final one for me, Todd; just helpful commentary on the
money market fee waivers. Just overall on the business, one, could you just give a sense of what the investment team
has done with all the peripheral Europe issues that have been out there; and second, could we just get updated thoughts
on broader money market fund reform and just how you see that playing out, whether it be the scenarios like some
capital underpinning the business or variable NAV, that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Why don't I start and then I'll turn it over to Curtis, I think, to get into some of the
details. But obviously the positions are being managed very carefully. There is no exposure in any of the books to the
peripheral eurozone. The exposure is going to – where there is exposure to Europe it's in the – what I'll call the
non-periphery eurozone or the other non-eurozone euro. It's become very short-term in nature. A very significant
amount of it is in overnight or overnight equivalents. So I think the – and that's having an impact obviously on the yield
and further depressing the yield, but also and therefore further impacting the fee waivers. I think – Curtis, you want to
add anything on the regulatory reform and the impact to money market funds going forward?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Other than obviously watching it very closely, how it's evolving different perspectives on
how this should play out. I think the low yield environment obviously impacts some of those discussions but we're

obviously watching it very closely. And I would just – to Todd's point about how we're managing the portfolio,
certainly have boosted liquidity in our overnight positions and away from overnight have reduced exposures to both the
non-eurozone and eurozone. Just in sync with I think the overall market dynamics.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Two questions, one on expenses and one on M&A. On expense side, could you just explain a
little bit how much more room you have to bring down expenses here given what looks like you had relatively tight
management in this quarter? And the oth – part of this is, is the head count reduction that you announced in the past
quarter fully embedded within the third quarter results?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, why don't I take that and then I'll turn it over to Gerald. The announcement that we
made in the third quarter with the freeze and the intent to, through attrition, primarily reduce the head count really went
into effect late in the quarter, Betsy, so it had limited if any impact on the third quarter itself. We do continue to benefit
from some of the – our growth centers and that's where the growth in our head count has taken place.
We are going to go through this in some detail on November 14th at our Investor Day, where we will talk to some very
specific initiatives, give you a sense of the timing of those initiatives and how they'll be driven through the P&L and
the impact they should have on our operating margins going forward, which is I think is the only way you can really
measure those. So we will give – from a longer-term perspective, I think we'll give a lot more color there.
Looking to the fourth quarter, our goal is to try to keep the expenses pretty stable. So if we can manage to go through a
couple of quarters, I think we can demonstrate that – there could be some noise there, but we could demonstrate that I
think we can keep them reasonably stable, even showing some of the modest revenue growth that we've been seeing
over the past year or so.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And, Betsy, let me just add, I view the head count reduction and the hiring freeze as sort of
the foundation for a broad-based program. And there are a number of initiatives which we'll outline, as Todd said, on
November 14th, but the head count and the salaries are just a foundation. So things like platform consolidations,
working on the networks, working on procurement, a whole variety of different things, and we're going to try to lay it
out for you by general category and by business not just for 2012, but over a three-year period of time and it will be
very focused for you to be able to go through.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, that will be helpful because you've been ramping investment spend to get the platform
consolidation already, haven't you? So is there an uptick from that? Or is that at a steady run rate at this stage?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: The way I look at it is we've got to afford it within the expense reductions so we're going to
take some level of the expense reductions and reinvest in the businesses and reinvest in growth. But we still have to, as
Todd said, improve the margins. You have to see it in the income statement.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And then on strategic opportunities, is there anything that you're looking at or thinking
about? Or does your capital ratio preclude you from being able to be more creative there?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Obviously the first priority is, given our share price, is share buybacks and dividends. We
want to get the capital ratios up, even though we have the flexibility to get them up above 7% relatively quickly if we
chose to. And so acquisitions are a lesser priority. If the turmoil in Europe springs out an asset that's incredibly cheap

and incredibly accretive, we might look at it. But the first priority is to really return the excess capital to shareholders.
With a $19 or $20 share price, there's no better investment.
<A - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question is from John Stilmar with SunTrust.
<Q - John Stilmar>: Good morning. A quick question for you guys and it touches on Betsy's last point with regard to
expenses. And not to front run the Analyst Day, but if we're trying to look back to an achievable operating margin,
which seems like you're not necessarily going to get to by slashing the bottom line but continuing to reinvest in – for
the top line, what is a reasonable frame that we should be thinking about for your business over the three-year time
horizon for us kind of bouncing around the bottom here in today's current environment?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: John, you're pushing pretty hard there. We don't give a quarter's guidance and now you're
looking for three years of it. There is operating leverage in the business model. We do get scale benefits. What we will
try to give you on Investor Day is you plug in what you think market conditions are going to look like and revenue
growth rates will be, and we'll give you a sense of – I think you'll be able to come away with it, a sense of where the
operating margins can be and how much operating leverage there will be. Obviously it's a function of revenue growth.
If revenue is flat, it is pretty hard to generate much in the way of operating margin of operating leverage. But if we've
got a little bit of revenue growth, I think we can create it.
<Q - John Stilmar>: Perfect. In terms of your Custody business, can you talk to me a little bit more about the
pipeline? It seems like new business wins may have taken a step back this quarter and just curious about what your
vantage point is from here given the market volatility? Are you seeing more people come to you for back office and
middle office support? I'm just trying to compare and contrast how you see your pipeline.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: John, I'll make a quick comment and then turn it over to Tim Keaney, who is on the line
actually from our Asset Servicing Conference, so he can give you the real scoop first hand. Generally, the pipeline is
quite strong. There's a lot of outsourcing activity within it. And a lot of the new business wins that you saw in the
quarter didn't necessarily bring assets under custody with it. It brought fees and outsourcing services and ancillary
services so not as heavy in the assets under custody area. But maybe with that as a general comment, Tim, can you pick
up on it?
<A - Timothy Keaney>: Yes. Thanks, Gerald, and thanks for the question, John. The pipeline is up about 50%
year-on-year, John. Most of it is driven by financial institutions and outsourcing. As you point out, that's been about a
three quarter trend now and about 50% of the new business pipeline is outsourcing and that's really defined broadly
things that clients do for themselves today that they look for us to provide. And as you know, and I think we've talked
about before, we feel particularly well positioned in that space.
<Q - John Stilmar>: Great. Thank you, guys.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thanks, John.

Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi. Thanks. So I appreciate the comments on the 250 basis points on – worth of sub-investment
grade securities. Can you talk a little bit about the maturity profile? Because I'm just – I'm assuming that you feel that
they're good assets, they're yielding high and so it's not worth getting rid of them now, but just curious when that starts
leaking into the capital base.

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, it's – we're seeing pay downs at close to – kind of the way the numbers work,
Glenn, we're seeing pay downs of about $100 million a month, maybe slightly less. And the portfolio will probably
burn off – it's probably got an average life of about four years. And – but we are accreting some of that back into the
P&L so at about $100 million a quarter level. So net-net about 200 and some odd million decrease. Since it's a 1250%
risk-weighted asset, you multiply that by 12.5 times. That's 250 – that's $2.5 billion or about 1% of our risk-weighted
assets that's coming off, a little bit more than that, each quarter.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Perfect. That's great. Thanks. And then just further on that, you had about an 87%-ish payout
ratio this quarter. Hear your comments loud and clear on how you feel about the stock and you're generating a lot of
capital; any – everybody okay, meaning regulars, with an 87% pay out ratio? Didn't know how they balance capital
now, capital in the future, and capital gen – current capital generation.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I mean, the plan that we had passed was over the course of 12 months we'd buy
back $1.3 billion. So you can expect that we won't buy back at the rate that we did in the second quarter in future
quarters. But there's no – we are following our plan and, in fact, our ratios are in line or better than what we had
planned.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: So for the whole year, Glenn, it's certainly in line with what the regulators would expect in
terms of combination of dividends and buybacks on a payout ratio. The third quarter was just particularly heavy.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I'm with you. Final one on NIM. You had mentioned NIM was slightly up, let's just call it stable,
ex the big balance sheet growth this quarter. Steady state balance sheet, what are the puts and takes that are helping you
see that stable NIM? Because obviously the natural weight of gravity right now with rates is going to pull it down. Are
you doing a little more investing further out or in corporates on the securities side? And I did see loans pick up as well.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, there are a couple items there. One of the things that we have seen NIM spike, we
think that's pretty hot money and we're not going to do a lot with that that but there has been underlying growth in the
deposit base that we think will be core. So we've invested that in a number of different securities, relatively short
duration. Some of it is in floating rate. The duration that we're getting from that is – and we've bought some munis.
We've bought some mostly short duration treasuries and kind of inside the window of when the Fed would probably be
expected to do something. Any of the duration that we add comes through agency RMBS. Some of that is floaters.
Most of it's seasoned 15-year type of stuff as well as munis and some corporates. So there's a mix of assets that we've
added to the portfolio, probably about $7 billion or $8 billion over the past two quarters or so.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And, Glenn, regarding the secured loan program that you saw, it's mostly to broker-dealers
and other very large clients. Highly secured, highly visible assets, margined and valued daily and we feel pretty good
about being able to provide that sort of liquidity to major clients in a very secured way and can get a little better yield
off of that versus certainly leaving it in central banks.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Perfect. Thanks for all that.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks, Glenn.

Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi. Good morning, folks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Just to add on to that question on the deposit side, what would you characterize as sort of the
level of hot money deposits in the quarter on an average basis? And how is that trending into fourth quarter and

whether you think that will stick around into year end?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We saw most of the pop in the deposit base, Brian, take place at the end of the second
quarter and into the third quarter. It's been reasonably stable since then and it's started to trend down slightly. But in this
rate environment, kind of the risk-off and defensive environment that some of them are taking, we could be here for a
while.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Certainly the noise in Europe, more than noise, is continuing to cause clients to want to leave
deposits with us. So it's been a fairly extended period of time that the "hot money" has been here. And that's one of our
challenges is how to determine how long it's going to be here versus putting it to work through the investments.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Right. And as in regards to the charges that you're putting on what you, I think, regard as not
just excess deposits, but excess over some normal levels from some of the large clients, do you see those levels
increasing or decreasing?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: The – we had proposed a deposit charge to our clients if they kept a significant amount of
excess deposits from what was already a spiked rate. And these were really targeted to the clients, I think, that had
taken advantage and perhaps even arbitraged some of the market conditions at the time. After we spoke to them, we
basically explained how they could go about avoiding those charges through managing those deposits, which they have
done. So we really don't expect that to be a generator. For the vast, vast majority of our clients it really had no impact.
Not to say if conditions didn't change we wouldn't reconsider, but that's where we are right now.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: It's interesting and amazing, Brian; it shouldn't be too amazing that when you consider
charging someone for something and they can change their behavior, they actually do.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Funny how that works. And then just a quick one on the Basel III ratio, as far as getting to 7%
by year end, are you basically thinking about it in a more flexible way? Like you don't really need to get to the 7.0%
because you've got the flexibility on the investment grade book? Or are you still really trying to get there?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We would like to achieve it. It's going to be a little more difficult if the balance sheet and
the risk-based assets are going to stay higher than we had anticipated. We're not wedded to being there. If we generate
at the typical level you can estimate where we might be. But we think we have adequate flexibility. Things do change,
but given the risks that we have on our balance sheet and the mix of assets that we have, we're very comfortable with
our capital ratios.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: How much is left to buy back out of the $1.3 billion?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We've done about $800 million in the first two quarters of the buyback.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: And then just very last on new business trends; so the $96.1 billion in Asset Servicing, what
was installed in the quarter? And then what is – what do you still have in your pipeline left to convert that's not in the
custody numbers yet?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Tim, why don't you pick up on that one?
<A - Timothy Keaney>: Thanks, Brian. First of all, I think as we talk about the new business, $96 billion is a little bit
misleading because if you look at in revenue terms, it's very steady over the last five quarters because of the mix of new
business that doesn't really relate to assets under custody, so transfer agency and middle office outsourcing. We
converted 235 – $245 billion for the quarter and we still have about $320 billion left to convert. And I would say that
will probably come in pretty evenly over the next two quarters; if that's helpful.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Yes, that is helpful. Great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: It seems like competition is still pretty high in the servicing business and everyone points
fingers at everybody else to who's causing it. But when we looked at your linked-quarter numbers, assets under custody
are only down 2% but your fees are down 5%. And so my question is are you causing that competition? Maybe it
makes sense to cut prices and gain market share? Or why would there be that disconnect?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: The majority of that, Mike, that decline, is we combine – in our asset servicing number
you see both sec lending and asset servicing. So about, I think it was close to half of the decline, was related to the sec
lending numbers. And I don't know if Tim or Joe, if you have anything else...
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Before – even excluding sec lending, the fees are still down more than the assets under custody.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Slightly. Just slightly. Mike, we've had this conversation for years. It's always going to be a
competitive environment. We are maintaining price discipline in terms of new services and gaining new business. I
know Tim's working on a program to look at how we potentially change some level of pricing paradigm for different
types of clients and maybe once we get into it – and we're certainly going to share more of that on Investor Day. But
we're very mindful of getting the fees to cover the operating expenses in the business so we're less reliant on the quote
"capital markets activities" and that's one of our goals.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And Gerald, this is the first conference call we've had with you as CEO so I know you'll
talk about this at your Investor Day but how do you see running the company? What changes might we expect and also
why did Bob Kelly leave?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I can't comment on the last part, but in terms of the first part of your question, Mike, clearly I
think the power of our company is the breadth of our services and our business model. We need to do a better job
collaborating across our company and making it easier for our clients to do business with us in providing solutions sets
to them that I don't think anyone else on the planet can do. Instead of selling individual product lines or individual
business lines to clients, we really need to think more holistically on their behalf and present a combined set of services
in a better way than we have done. And so our client coverage model, our go to market model, working more
collaboratively as a team across our businesses, I think is going to be the best way we improve and increase our
revenue growth and market position with our clients. That's my focus.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And I guess we'll hear more about this at Investor Day but if we were to look at one or two
metrics to see your progress, to measure that focus, what would that be?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, I think in terms of operating efficiencies, Mike, one of the metrics that we started
giving you is our investor service fees over expenses. And they're inching upward. We'd like to get them – they're about
97, I believe, this quarter; we'd like to get them up above 100%. And that's going to demonstrate that we've either
improved pricing or we've improved efficiencies.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then last question, the fee waivers are earning $0.05 per quarter. At what point do you get a
little bit more aggressive in charging clients?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: In charging clients for fees? I think that in the instances where we are looking at bringing
in clients, we're looking at all of the fees that we'd anticipate generating from that and then we're holding the discipline
and taking into consideration impacts whether it's around fee waivers or NIR or even sec lending in this environment.
So I think the team is trying to hold discipline to do that now. In terms of if there's no yield it's pretty hard to charge
much of a rate, so it's going to be more of a market consideration specifically on fee waivers.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Hi, Ken.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Morning, Ken.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Two questions. Just one with the balance sheet size, I know all of it that's coming in is not risk
weighted but there eventually becomes a leverage constraint. I'm just wondering if in fact does the bloated balance
sheet come into your thinking at all about capital management and balance sheet planning?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure because there is a leverage ratio that we need to meet. It should decline given the $30
billion move in the course of the quarter. Now that it's stabilized and we continue to see the Tier I capital ratio grow,
we don't think there's going to be much pressure there.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. So that doesn't weigh on it. Okay. My second question is just about you mentioned that
corporate trust was actually up a little bit sequentially. And I saw that the debt administered was up. It was obviously
clearly a meaningful down quarter in terms of origination activity so I'm just wondering if you could just give us a little
more color on what the underlying trends are in corporate trust and what's happening as far as either market share or
pricing?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure, Ken. Why don't we have Karen address that?
<A - Karen B. Peetz>: Sure. Ken, our corporate trust business performed pretty well. It was also impacted by fee
waivers, money market funds. But some of that money actually went into NIR, okay? And you're right, debt market
activity was down, other than ABS and high yield and U.S. municipal debt is looking better.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And so, Ken, the way to think about it is while the structured market has obviously not come
back, which is the highest fee realization of our trusteeships, we are seeing some activity in the corporate and muni
market and that's why the number of trustees under administration have gone up. So we're hopeful that we'll start to see
a comeback in that marketplace. Obviously at some point, given the bank's balance sheets globally, cannot carry debt to
support economic growth; they're going to have to access the capital markets. And so we think we're going to be in a
great position when that turns around.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Got it.
<A - Karen B. Peetz>: The only other thing I'd add is that we are reducing expenses and looking to make the business
more efficient, so that's a big focus in that business.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Sure. And my last follow-up is just on the issuer services strength, I'm just wondering, can you
tease that out a little bit more for us in terms of – I'm talking about the fee side, not the income side, because we don't
see that segment data any more. But on the fee income side 365 going to 442, could you just kind of break down what
was the pull forward of seasonality and what was activity in DRs versus how corporate trust acted?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, it was – why don't I take that one, Karen. It was primarily the pull forward of DRs
and that's why I think as you look out to the fourth quarter you should adjust to reflect that. And what I made in my
forward-looking comments is that we would expect revenues in issuer services to go down sequentially as a result of
that and offset somewhat by performance fees, for example, in Asset Management. It'll be a headwind for us in the
fourth quarter, Ken.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: No doubt. I'm just trying to understand if just core DR activity was also better or worse, just
based on volume trends as opposed to the corporate actions that got pulled forward? Do you know what I mean? Just
core market activity versus the pull forward of the seasonality?

<A - Karen B. Peetz>: Ken, year-to-date some of the issuance facts for DRs, we had 5.1 billion DRs compared to 2.2
billion this time last year. So that was obviously increased volume. Of course we continue to have great market share,
55% of the new business we won, and we acted as the depositary for 53% of new offerings. So that's all very strong.
We had a great quarter for DRs and a strong pipeline. But there is some slowing in corporate action and some delays in
IPO activity. So net-net, we have more DRs outstanding than we've ever had, 35 billion.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Got it. Sorry for this last one and I'm finished. Can you tell us what the gains from the sale of
loans was in the investment and other line this quarter?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We don't disclose that but it was down pretty meaningfully from where it was in the
second quarter, Ken. And if you look at what our asset and other income was running this quarter, about $90 million,
that's consistent where it was a year ago and that's kind of where we would ballpark what we would expect there.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. Great. Thanks. Sorry for that extra one.

Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander Blostein CFA>: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Sorry to circle back on this again, but can you actually
just give us a dollar amount of seasonality in the DR business this quarter? And then as a follow-up to that, I think it
might be just helpful to maybe quantify year-to-date revenues in Issuer Services and if you could kind of break it down
by what's DR, what's corporate action. And I guess the last piece would be shareowner services, which I think goes
away in the fourth quarter. So what would be the impact of that?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure. I'll take some of that. We don't break out all of that detail, Alex, but to give you a little
color, shareowner services we anticipate closing on that either late this quarter or early in the first quarter. That'll have
a nominal impact to our net earnings. You'll see a little – a modest loss of revenues for the company as a result of that
but it'll be – you'll also see a reduction in expenses to go with it and we don't think it'll have a meaningful impact to the
P&L. And there will be some capital generation, probably on the order of about 20 basis points in our Basel III Tier 1
common ratio. And that'll leave the Issuer Services, the primary businesses there obviously being the corporate trust
and the DRs and they're both substantial businesses.
DRs has got the momentum that Karen just explained as we continue to see growth in it and it really is the developing
markets play for us. Although we're seeing a little softness around IPOs and that type of activity just given the current
market events, we continue to see pretty good strength there.
In terms of corporate trust, there's some headwinds. There really is no structured debt market as you know. And that
was probably the highest margin business so we're seeing that run off faster than anything is replacing it. The business
itself is actually doing reasonably well because balances continue to grow. But it'll be difficult to keep – in the near
term, to keep fees flat there.
<Q - Alexander Blostein CFA>: Okay. And then the dollar amount of seasonality this quarter?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: What I'd indicated is we – I think the way to look at it is if you kind of average the last two
quarters of last year you would probably get a ballpark with this year.
<Q - Alexander Blostein CFA>: Got you. Thanks. And then shifting gears a little bit, can you elaborate a little bit on
the CVA adjustment this quarter; where, I guess, the loss came from and anything you can disclose on the
counter-party, that would be helpful.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. The CVA adjustment is – as spreads widen, we discount a receivable back at a
higher rate and therefore it's less valuable, so we generally see spreads widen. Our counter-parties tend to be very high

quality but there are a substantial number where we are actually a receiver of fixed, the fixed rate and as – in interest
rate derivatives, and as interest rates came down the exposure went up so you had a little larger exposure and that larger
exposure was discounted at a little higher rate. I expect we'll recover that over the next few quarters.
<Q - Alexander Blostein CFA>: I see. Thanks. And then the last one for me, maybe going back to the FX issue and if
you could tie that in maybe with litigation expenses this quarter, so do you have anything reserved for FX issues so far?
And does, I guess, the $80 million this quarter can you elaborate a little bit on what in particular that had to do with?

Thank you and our final question today is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning guys. When do you guys think that you might find out what your
SIFI buffer will be and do you expect to be included in the global SIFIs when those names come out?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Gerard, right now we're not certain. I would expect by year end we should know. And
although we don't know for sure, I would expect we will probably be included in the global SIFI.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Any idea on what you think is an appropriate SIFI buffer for you folks?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I think appropriate would be zero.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Right.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: But what do I expect it will actually be? I really don't know; it could be in the 50 to 150
basis point range, probably.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. And then last quarter I think your sales as well as your two main competitors talked a
lot about raising prices for certain services with your customers on existing relationships. Are you still trying to do
that? Is there any progress that you're making there? Are customers accepting price increases and maybe share some
color on that?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Gerard, we're just beginning the process. We're going through a bifurcation process
with smaller clients in a more standardized operating service and some level of pricing paradigm change there. We
have a beta group that we're working with as we speak. And then in terms of as contracts come up for renewal, we are
having the normal conversations with clients; trying to have them appreciate the value of the services we bring versus
the fees they pay and less reliance, again, on the capital market activity. So we're in the early innings of this and we'll
give you more of an update at investor day.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Final question on the fee waivers that you gave us some detail on, what type of – how much
higher can they grow, I guess? Do interest rates, maybe meaning on the long end of the curve, have to fall another 25 or
40 basis points or are they going to be constant at these levels where it just stays at this level?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I would expect that this is the bottom but it's possible that that could change so if we saw
short-term rates decline even further I think it would put additional pressure on money market funds being able to
generate any kind of a spread, and therefore they could potentially pick up. But when we look back and we look at the
current environment, this feels like the bottom and if we see a little normalcy coming around the globe, you might be
able to generate a little more yield and therefore not waive quite as much of the fees.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Thanks, Gerard.
