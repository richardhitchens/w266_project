MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Your lines have been placed
on listen only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be
archived at www.pepsico.com.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you
may begin.
Jamie Caulfield
Thank you, Laurie. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's
CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our first quarter 2015 performance and full-year outlook, and then
we'll move on to Q&A. We recognize today is a busy earnings day with a number of other consumer and mega cap
companies reporting, so we've kept our comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the call by 8:45.
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking
statements including statements regarding 2015 guidance and our long-term targets based on currently available
information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results
to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements. Statements made on this conference call
should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release
and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.

Unless otherwise indicated, all references to EPS and operating profit growth are on a core constant currency basis. All
references to free cash flow exclude certain items. In addition, references to organic revenue results in this call exclude
the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes and foreign exchange translations.
To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing PepsiCo's financial results,
you should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investor's section of
PepsiCo's website under the Events and Presentations tab. As we discuss today's results, please keep in mind that our
first quarter comprises the 12 weeks ended March 21 for our North American operations and it is a short quarter for our
international businesses, reflecting the two months of January and February on most of our operations outside of North
America.
And finally, our core Q1 2015 earnings results include a $39 million pre-tax gain related to the refranchising of a
portion of our India bottling operations. We also recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $65 million associated with
our dairy joint venture during the quarter. And as you may recall, our Q1 2014 core earnings results included a $31
million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain agricultural assets in Europe.
And now it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
Indra K. Nooyi
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2015. Our
focus on innovation, brand building and market based execution funded in part by our productivity initiatives continued
to drive solid, fundamental business performance.
In the first quarter, organic revenue grew 4.4% with global snacks up 7%, and global beverages up 1.5%, and core
gross margins improved by 150 basis points. Excluding the impairment charge and gains Jamie mentioned, core
operating margin improved 65 basis points, core constant currency operating profit grew 11%, and core constant
currency EPS grew 16%. However, foreign exchange headwinds persist. We have and will continue to take actions to
manage to the current volatile macroeconomic environment by taking responsible pricing actions, tightly controlling
costs and optimizing our global sourcing to minimize and mitigate the impacts of the current foreign exchange
challenges.
I am particularly pleased with the level of effective pricing we're achieving, especially in global beverages where we
realized 3 points of effective net pricing. At the same time, we will not let cyclical macroeconomic issues divert us
from our focus to drive sustainable shareholder value creation. We intend to continue to invest across our markets and
brands to generate organic revenue growth, drive greater efficiency and productivity, deliver attractive free-cash flow
and cash returns to shareholders and enhance our returns on invested capitals.
The power of our portfolio of products and brands and the strength of our geographic footprint have enabled us to
consistently meet or exceed our financial gross, and more importantly, give us confidence in the future prospects for
our business.
As you know, in June this year, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of PepsiCo which is the coming together of
Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay. As we celebrate this milestone, we look back on our journey with pride.
In 1965, our annual revenue was $510 million. Today it stands over $66 billion. $100 investment in PepsiCo's stock in
1965 was worth nearly $43,000 at the end of 2014, a compound annual total shareholder return of over 13%, gar
out-pacing the S&P 500. And the reason we've performed so well is that throughout our history we have delivered
short-term performance with a keen eye on the long-term sustainable of our results. We've done this because
throughout the past half century, PepsiCo has made bold moves to reshape our portfolio, build new capabilities and
broaden our geographic footprint.
So today, our portfolio is positioned well. Our annual net revenue is nearly split evenly between the U.S. and countries
outside the U.S. And just over half of our global revenue is derived from snacks with the remainder from beverages. In

aggregate, carbonated soft drinks comprise less than 25% of our 2014 total global revenue. And while we are proud to
have the Pepsi name on the door, coolers represented less than 15% of our total revenue mix. And this speaks exactly to
how we've transformed and will continue to transform our portfolio to address ever changing consumer needs and
preferences.
As you know, we will also develop new capabilities to compete in the rapidly evolving global business environment.
For example, we transformed our operating model to blend global scale leverage with locally focused execution and
this has increased our ability to capture efficiencies, lift and shift the best ideas and capabilities from PepsiCo's teams
around the world and win at the point of sale.
We have raised design as the core building block of our new product pipeline with innovation representing over 9% of
our net revenue in 2014. And we're very proud to report that three PepsiCo products have received the 2015 Nielsen
Breakthrough Innovation Award. The award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched
in the U.S. in 2013 and PepsiCo is also the only company to receive multiple awards this year.
Lastly, productivity is now part of our DNA with $1 billion in annual savings projected through 2019. These savings
enable us to maintain or increase necessary investments in the business to drive strong organic revenue growth. And we
are always looking to re-conceptualize our business to unlock even more productivity. We're proud of the legacy results
we're building this company on.
So, with that backdrop, let's take a look at how our business has performed, starting with North America which again
delivered strong results in an otherwise sluggish packaged food and beverage environment. In fact, in Q1 2015,
PepsiCo was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over
$300 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was nearly three times the next largest contributor to
growth and represented more growth than the next 19 largest manufacturers combined. Notably, North American
beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales
growth on a stand-alone basis.
Turning now to PepsiCo Americas Beverages, it delivered organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit
growth while holding U.S. LRB value share. Our strategy has not waivered as we continue to manage the business
responsibly with consistent positive price realization across the portfolio.
Within the U.S., we gained value share across important subcategories including sports drinks and ready-to-drink teas
and we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSD, and for
Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our non-carbonated portfolio. We were proud of PepsiCo's execution at
this year's Super Bowl. We had over 60,000 integrated food and beverage displays merchandised at retail, up nearly
70% from the prior year.
We also continue to invest in R&D to drive sustainable innovation. For example, we rolled out a newly designed
Gatorade 28-ounce bottle which is a sleek, contemporary designed bottle that was built with improved ergonomics
informed by athlete insights. Early results are promising , with this packaging innovation contributing to double digit
retail sales growth in regions that have converted to the new packaging.
We also focused on health and wellness innovations. We recently introduced new Naked Juice flavors including Chia
Cherry Lime, Chia Sweet Peach and Bright Beets which offer delicious fruit and vegetable smoothies that pack a
nutritional punch. And we launched Tropicana Farmstand Tropical Greens which is a great-tasting green juice that has
a full serving of fruits and vegetables in each 8-ounce glass with no added sugar.
Additionally, we recently launched Mountain Dew DEWshine, a craft premium soda inspired by the brand roots in the
back woods of Tennessee. It is a clear citrus Dew made with real cane sugar and packaged in clear, glass bottles. We're
also excited to report the new foodservice partnership with Umami Burger which will serve Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew
and Sierra Mist all made with real sugar at its 24 locations. In addition, we entered into a new multi-year deal with Live
Nation. We are the music company's official carbonated soft drink and bottled water partner and have exclusive
pouring rights at 75 of Live Nations U.S. events spaces.

And we're also pleased about our new multi-year food and beverage partnership with the National Basketball
Association, Women's National Basketball Association, NBA Development League and USA Basketball beginning
next season. As far as an expansive food and beverage partnership with the League, PepsiCo will leverage its Mountain
Dew, Aquafina, Brisk, Doritos and Ruffles brand to engage NBA fans through PepsiCo's world class sports marketing
and high-profile activation. The partnership between the NBA and PepsiCo builds upon the league's relationship with
Gatorade which is the NBA's longest-standing partner.
Turning now to Frito-Lay North America, delivered another quarter of very strong results, organic revenue grew 4%
and core constant currency operating profit rose 7%. The U.S. salty snacks category continued to show solid growth
and Frito market share again posted steady sequential improvement supported by both volume growth and price
realization. Our key brands led revenue growth including particularly good performance from Lays, Doritos and
Cheetos and we continue to innovate. We launched Cheetos Sweetos, the first ever sweet Cheetos in the U.S. as well as
Tostitos Dip-etizers, Doritos Jacked 3D and Rold Gold Pretzel Dippers.
Additionally, our Lay's Do Us a winner in 2014. Lay's Kettle Wasabi Ginger, returned to the shelves. We're also
excited about the return of our highly successful Lay's Do Us A Flavor consumer contest. Fans nationwide have
submitted their ideas for the next great potato chips flavor for a chance to win $1 million dollar grand prize and we will
announce the four delicious finalist flavors this summer.
Quaker Foods North America delivered commendable results despite continued challenges across central store food
categories. During the quarter we gained or held value share in the U.S. in all three of our key categories, hot,
ready-to-eat cereal and snack bars while expanding gross margin at the same time. These value share gains were driven
by innovation which includes the launch of Quaker 3-minute steel cut oats in the quarter. This product has the same
hearty texture and nutty flavor as traditional steel cut oats, but caters to the consumers need for convenient products as
the cook time is cut from 30 minutes to just three minutes. We also launched gluten-free varieties of Quaker Popped
Rice Crisps.
And then turning to developing and emerging markets, our business has delivered 10% organic revenue growth in the
quarter despite all of the ongoing volatility in many regions of the world. Looking across some of our key D&E
markets, our business continued to prove resilient with double-digit revenue growth in China and Turkey and mid
single digit organic revenue growth in Mexico, Egypt and India.
So before I turn it over to Hugh, I want to highlight a few key points. As an operating company, we absolutely manage
the things that are within our control; marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity, and we expect to
continue to perform well in these areas.
However, we expect to face continued headwinds related to macros. In particular, weak currencies in a number of our
key markets and the impact of low oil prices in countries whose economies are highly dependent on energy. Obviously
these are outside our control, but we adjust to business weather through the challenges as best as we can by controlling
costs, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing pricing actions. And these steps contributed to our strong
fundamental performance in Q1.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?
Hugh F. Johnston
Thank you, Indra, and good morning everyone. Turning to guidance, for the full year 2015, we expect mid-single digit
organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset
negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of higher than previously expected
transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $1 billion of productivity savings.
Below the division operating profit line, we continue to expect corporate cost to be lower, a core tax rate of
approximately 25% and to reduce share count. As a result, we continue to expect 7% core constant currency earnings
per share growth in 2015. However, given the continued strength in the U.S. dollar, we now expect foreign exchange

translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 percentage points
and 11 percentage points respectively based on current consensus market rates. That compares to our initial outlook of
7 percentage points for each back in February.
Keep in mind that while spot rates have shown improvement, we use consensus rates in calculating our expected
foreign exchange impacts and consensus rates have worsened for all of our key foreign currencies, including the
Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the British pound. Our outlook for the year
assumes continued translation of our Venezuela results at the SICAD rate of 12 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Should
circumstances dictate use of a higher rate, this would also negatively impact our U.S. dollar results. Taking our 2014
core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance in current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015
core EPS of approximately $4.44.
As you model out the second quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. Foreign exchange translation should have
an approximate 11 point unfavorable impact on the second quarter net revenue and approximate 12 point unfavorable
impact on second quarter core EPS based on current market consensus rate. And we expect a profit decline in Europe
driven by the volatility associated with transaction and translation currency related headwinds.
Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the second quarter versus last
year, primarily reflecting increased debt balances, and our tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be sequentially
higher than the first quarter of 2015.
Finally, our stepped-up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the year but is expected to have a more
pronounced impact in the second half of 2015. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash
flow of more than $7 billion. I want to emphasize that despite the expected incremental foreign exchange headwinds
this year, our original $7 billion free cash flow target remains intact. This is the result of stringent working capital
management and capital spending discipline. We've shortened our cash conversion cycle by over 50% since Q1 2012
and continue to manage capital spending with great efficiency holding capital spending below 5% of sales.
We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady
progress we've made in ROIC over the past two years with core net ROIC up 220 basis points to 17.5% from 2012 to
2014.
And we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through both
dividends and share repurchases, again, consistent with our original target. As a reminder, our previously announced
7% dividend per share increase will commence with the June payment. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of
annual dividend increases and an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. And our annualized
dividends per share grew at low double-digit compound annual growth rate over the past 10 years.
To summarize, our core constant currency outlook for 2015 is unchanged from our last call and free cash flow,
disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company.
With that, operator, we will take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning. Can you discuss demand elasticity so far from the higher pricing you have
taken? It looks like it has been pretty muted with the solid organic sales growth. So I am just wondering where demand
elasticities are coming in versus your expectations, particularly in Latin America and Russia given some of the macro
difficulties there.

And then as we look going forward, as FX pressure continues to worsen do you plan to take incremental pricing
internationally? Because I imagine at some point you don't want to push too far from a consumer standpoint. And then
last, just a detail question. The pricing number was very strong in Latin American foods and I suspect in the Latin piece
of PAB, how much of that was driven by Venezuela versus other geographies?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Dara, overall, I tell you demand elasticity, in these times when you've got high inflation and
you've got transactional FX hitting countries which require us to take pricing, the challenge is to balance volume and
revenue. And what we do in most cases is that we try to push through as much of the inflation as we can, raw material
inflation as we can, through pricing. In many cases we cannot cover all of it, but we try to price through about 75% of
the inflation, and then we manage very judiciously the revenue output and make sure that our volume decline is not
significant.
For example, let me take Russia. In Russia, we have pushed through a lot of pricing and we've married it up with a lot
of productivity also. So our results in Russia and our business is doing very well. The real issue is, yes, there's some
volume drop off, but I think in these times, we have to judiciously manage revenue and volume and then as the
economies recover, go back to volume growth. If we don't push pricing through now, it will be very hard to push it all
through later on to cover all of these costs. So, at every point in time in each of these countries, that's what we do.
And in terms of ongoing FX, spot rates are slightly better than consensus, we have to watch and see how this thing
evolves, but in every country. Again, every country is not moving exactly the same way. But country-by-country, as
FX moves, especially transactional FX impacts a country performance. We do take pricing at least to cover 75% of that
and the rest of it we try to cover through productivity. And as far as Venezuela is concerned, the footnotes in the Q's
will indicate exactly the impact of Venezuela and I think it will speak for itself.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey, good morning, everyone. First just a comment, a lot of companies reporting this
morning; you've put out a pretty efficient press release that was easy to read. So thank you for that. I guess my question
is – and somewhat related to Dara's question is, if we kind of look out over the balance of the year, there's certainly
some volatility still I guess we could expect in Russia and potentially Venezuela.
And so, if you could just talk to – you've maintained your currency neutral guidance and you also maintained your free
cash flow guidance – in the context still of having that type of volatility. So could you talk just about what some of the
factors that you're watching for that might drive some variances to those forecasts? And even specifically on free cash
flow, what other actions can you take if you still have – you're still compromised on foreign-exchange moving against
you.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Yeah, I'm going to let Hugh talk about cash flow but I'll just make an overall comment. Russia,
the business is doing very well, Brian. Retail, dairy products, juice products, basic snacks, the business is doing very
well. We have an excellent team in Russia, great productivity programs, putting the pricing through in very judicious
ways, doing very good revenue management. I'm very proud of the Russia team. And so they're managing through this
volatility very well. And Venezuela, the business is doing exceedingly well in Venezuela. The issue is the currency. So
let's hear Hugh now talk about what he's doing on the free cash flow to make sure that as a company we deliver on our
commitments on free cash flow. Go ahead, Hugh.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, happy to. Good morning, Brian. Really a couple of things. Number one, we do
continue to localize even more aggressively than we have in the past and obviously that helps us manage from a
currency perspective which helps us manage from a free cash flow perspective. Number two, we are managing CapEx
very tightly. You've seen us over the last few years come down from the mid 5%s in terms of CapEx as a percent of
revenue to we've been operating in the low 4%s. And then third we've managed working capital from what had
previously been about 21 days down to about three days.

In all candor, I still think we have more opportunity in that regard particularly on inventory and we're going to continue
to work that as quickly as we can in order to mitigate if there are further down sides. Right now we're giving you
market consensus. It's our best guess so definitionally that's a 50/50 as to which way it's going to go. But I do think we
can continue to do more from an inventory perspective in order to continue to cover if we have further down sides from
an FX perspective.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: And our new operating model is also allowing us to come up with more productivity ideas
across the company. So that's what we are working as a company against.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsch Bank.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: And also thanks for making the call so succinct today, it is a pretty crazy day. Hey, I know
this sounds kind of like a random question, but are you guys going to close down Muller? I saw a big impairment
charge in the quarter. So is that just to sort of write it down to the fair value now is that still going to be an initiative
you guys are going to work through?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: We're not closing down Muller. The business is still running and doing well. I think it just
didn't meet our expectations and we have to go through some retooling. I know that business is alive and kicking.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Hi Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So I guess my question is more of the PAB margin performance in the quarter, Hugh. I guess it
is the first quarter and the last few quarters the margin declined year-over-year. I know in the press release you did cite
lapping some of the one-time items. But can you just walk through the margin performance in PAB and how much was
timing versus just really some of the spending that you are doing to drive the business to grow from a top-line
perspective?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, a couple of elements there, Judy. First of all, the pricing environment is quite healthy.
We felt terrific about pricing in the quarter and we expect that to continue going forward. Two other drivers, obviously
advertising marketing was up a bit for the quarter and that's timing of the curve. That's one of the elements. The other
elements are some of the timing on spending with our Latin-American bottlers that drove that number, but we certainly
expect PAB margins to continue to grow over time as they have been.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Good morning. Thanks so much. Just one quick one, why did you leave the charge in the
Quaker operating income? Is there a good reason for that? And then it would be great if you could just tell us what it's
like on the ground in Russia and Brazil right now, possibly even Mexico. Because there is a sense that things are
deteriorating in Brazil, for example, so it would just be great to hear from you.

<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: We left the charge in the Quaker operating income because it's managed as Quaker Muller.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, that's the accounting. It's part of the line of business.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: On the ground in Russia as Hugh just mentioned, we've been localizing cost and we have a
very, very good team that's doing all the right things in terms of productivity, taking pricing, adjusting the product line
to make sure it's suited for a Russian consumer that's shopping differently now. And so I'd say that on the ground in
Russia, the business is doing well. And I think it's giving an opportunity for all companies operating in Russian to look
and see how to tighten their belts and work with each to lower each other's costs. So except for the overall
macro-geopolitical issues in Russia, on the ground, the business in Russia looks okay.
In terms of Mexico, again, we've operated in Mexico for decades and we've operated through massive volatility. At this
point, we're not seeing that kind of volatility at all in Mexico. We have pockets of security issues, but overall, Mexico's
just fine. Brazil did see a slowdown coming of the real weakening and the on top of that the [ph] graft (29:38) issues
happening in Brazil. Yes, we did see some turmoil in Brazil. And our business is still holding, Caroline, but I'd say of
the three countries that you mentioned, probably in the last quarter, Brazil is where we saw some on the ground action
that we are watching very carefully at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. How are you? Actually I had two questions. One is just to zoom in on cost a little bit,
please. I wanted to understand a little bit more what is driving some of the commodity inflation being higher for the
year. Why for FLNA and PAB you had, quote, operating cost inflation. Is that wages? And then importantly also, just
as you continue to cut the $1 billion of cost you have a few more years of that, but what happens after that? So that is
the cost question. And the other one is – I know it is early days, but as you are seeing Coca-Cola re-franchise more and
more of its U.S. bottling operations, are you seeing anything that shows a change in pattern of their activity in the
marketplace? Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I'm going to answer two parts and I'm going to turn it to Hugh on commodity inflation. And as
I mentioned in my script, Ali, we talked about the $1 billion per year for the next five years. But when we announced
$1 billion a year for the next five years, we started working on the next round of ideas to think about even more
productivity opportunities. And we'll come back and talk to you about it when we're ready to talk about it, but believe
me, once we change the operating model of the company to really look across the company as opposed to allowing
each country and region to just operate independently, there are more opportunities for efficiency. So, that's what we
are working on.
And in terms of the Coke refranchising its bottling operations, let's not forget why we bought back the bottling assets.
We bought it back because we wanted to improve efficiency in the system. And most importantly, we wanted to serve
our customers in a seamless way and be able to put in a lot of innovation through a bottling system which had to move
from huge, monolithic products to a highly fragmented set of products. That original proposition has [ph] now (31:52)
changed. What we are seeing today is disciplined pricing in the market, and from our perspective, the integrated
operating system is very valuable and we intend to continue to operate that way. So, on the commodity inflation, Hugh,
quickly.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yes, very briefly, it's almost entirely driven by foreign exchange, ex-foreign exchange, the
commodity inflation is almost flattish.

<Q - William Marshall>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning.
<Q - William Marshall>: I actually have a high level kind of strategic question for you. Indra, in your prepared
remarks you mentioned the challenges in center of the store food recently. And I think a couple of years ago you
labeled these businesses as not necessarily core to the mission, even though nice cash flow generating assets. I am kind
of wondering how you're thinking about those businesses in the current environment, especially with everything we've
seen going on with food and the interest rate environment that we are seeing now.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I think there's two kinds of businesses I said were not core to the mission. Quaker is very core
to the mission. What we were talking about is sort of the peripheral business we got as part of the Quaker Oats
acquisition, the Golden Grain, the Aunt Jemima. Those businesses are center of the store. They're not core to our
portfolio, but today, they're doing fine. They are holding their ground, sometimes even gaining share. They're
generating very valuable U.S. cash flow and these are businesses with fantastic margins.
So at this point, it's more dilutive to get rid of them than to keep them. And so what we're going to do is just manage
those businesses steadily as long as they don't distract us from our core mission of growing the rest of the portfolio.
And that's what we're focused on. Lastly, Bill, they also provide scale to our warehouse sales operation. So at this point,
just steady management of those businesses, don't distract ourselves from the core, enjoy the U.S. cash, the good
margins and that's all we're doing.

Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Good morning, Indra. Indra, I wanted to talk about sort of your old sort of buckets that the
business has had in terms of Fun for You, Better for You and Good for You. It seems as though we're seeing a change
in the consumer dynamic particularly in the Better for You bucket, if you look at something like diet soft drinks, what
have you. So I guess as we look at this what do you think has changed in terms of those buckets and what are you doing
differently to respond as the consumers maybe seem less interested in what you guys had traditionally discussed as
Better for You?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: That's a wonderful question, John, and I tell you something, we've never seen the consumer as
confused as they are today. And I use the word confused in a neutral way, not a negative way. If you had asked me a
few years ago, people are moving to diet sodas. Now they view real sugar as Good for You. They are willing to go to
organic non-GMO products even if it has high salt, high sugar, high-fat.
So I think we have a challenge these days to really think about what is the definition of Good for You from a consumer
perspective. And this is unprecedented and the old definition of Good for You is being challenged right now. So I think
the best way to think about this is to think about the fruit and vegetable corridor, a protein corridor, a grains corridor
and then sort of a predominantly carb corridor.
And then within that just vary our strategy based on what the consumer is thinking about, because especially
millennials today have got very different definitions of Good for You versus Fun for You. They don't really make the
definition and the difference that way. They're looking much more tat ingredients. So we are also going through a little
change in our thinking. The good news is whatever the segmentation is, our portfolio is still balanced and we can
actually flex to either definition. So, we are managing the business by watching both.

<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Yes. Thanks, and also thank you for being so to the point with this release and your
opening remarks. Indra, Hugh, a question about FX from a transactional standpoint. Obviously you have some major
productivity programs underway and we're a couple of years into this. But when you look at specifically the countries
of Mexico and China, are these higher transactional costs that are dollar-related – are they impacting you to the scope
of the phasing of some of your productivity programs in those particular countries?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, Mark, I would say no. It really doesn't affect us a great deal. We obviously have got
to be cognizant of what's happening with transactional FX. To the degree that we are experiencing that in a particular
market, as Indra mentioned earlier, we are tending to price through about 75% of it.
But in terms of if transactional FX is affecting capital that we would put in to drive productivity, it really isn't
impacting us a great deal. It's not slowing down the rate because the returns on those initiatives tend to be pretty solid
and we can overcome the FX impact.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Amit.
<Q - Amit Sharma>: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick clarification first. The 75% rule that you're talking
about, is that just to cover underlying inflation or should we expect that to cover the transactional FX as well?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I mean, transactional FX is what drives some of the inflation and so they're all related. I've
given you 75% of what we're doing today. It varies around that number. Sometimes we can do more. Sometimes we
can do less. But as a basket, it's around 75%.
The thing, Amit, is that globally we have been through in some country of the world hyperinflation, inflation,
extraordinary inflation, geopolitical crises, we have been through that. And across PepsiCo exists a lot of playbooks on
how to manage through these sorts of issues.
So when we have a problem like this in a country we bring the experts in, we use one of these playbooks and then we
use our extraordinary teams in these countries, then we judiciously manage through pricing, productivity, revenue
management to see how best to insulate the portfolio.
And I think the good news about the portfolio is that the portfolio serves as a good hedge when you have a mix of
countries, mix of businesses. That's what allows us to deliver the 7% constant currency growth, reiterate that guidance
and the free cash flow guidance.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: To be clear on that, I would think of the 75% as a rough modeling guideline, not an internal
principle as to how we execute market by market. We vary market by market based on the opportunities in front of us.

Our final question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Hey. Thanks. Maybe just a couple of final clarifications. First on pricing specifically in
Europe. Clearly it is difficult to realize in Western Europe, but the 6% price in this quarter is falling well short of sort
of the currency headwinds.
So was there additional pricing that maybe you took after the quarter in Eastern Europe and Russia or that you still
expect to take to catch up with currency? And if so what type of elasticity should we kind of think about around that
incremental pricing? That's first. And then second, maybe, Hugh, just some clarification and sensitivities around that
updated FX guidance, understanding you use consensus rates. If we benchmark to today's spot rates can you give us

some sense of what that outlook would look like at spot rates and how it might improve? And then conversely, if you
did move to the latest rates in Venezuela, some sensitivities around the magnitude of that impact in the other direction?
Thank you.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Okay, Steve. That is multiple questions but let me try to address it efficiently. Number one,
you will see more pricing in Eastern Europe that will come through. To date the elasticities in Russia have been less
than one. So as we put incremental pricing in we'll see how it looks going forward. But to date the elasticity has been
less than one. So obviously that's been favorable to us.
Number two, in terms of the overall FX, spot numbers are moving around so much I actually don't pay as much
attention to spot as I do to market consensus. So not clear to me, it might be a little bit favorable at this point. But I
would just stay focused on the guidance that we've given you rather than trying to anticipate it, it is awfully complex.
And then the last question was around?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: That was it.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: I think that was it. Anyway, Steve, if you have another question, you can give Jamie and the
team a call.
Indra K. Nooyi
Yes. Thank you all for your questions. And in closing I just want to say that we've taken the necessary steps to position
ourselves for sustainable long-term growth. I believe we're off to a good start in 2015, and we are navigating well
through an uncertain and volatile environment.
And I believe the first quarter of 2015 is a good example of how a well constructed portfolio, appropriate investment
and disciplined execution can drive strong constant currency top and bottom line results. Our first quarter results give
me confidence that our plans are working and that we are on track to deliver on our financial goals in 2015.
I thank you for your time this very busy morning and for the confidence you've placed in us with your investments.
Have a great day.
