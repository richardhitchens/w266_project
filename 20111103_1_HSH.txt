will take your questions at the end of Marcel's prepared remarks. To ensure that adequate time is available for all
questions, we request that you limit yourself to one, and we will do our best to answer them concisely. Jan?
Jan Bennink
Okay, thank you, Melissa. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Sara Lee's first quarter earnings release.
Let me start with sharing the agenda with you. I will start with giving you an update on our pure-play progress, the
spin, Mark will follow with the financial overview and Marcel will close with the business update. The Q&A session of
course, will be after Marcel's discussion.
Let me start with our promise number one, an update of our portfolio divestitures. As you have noticed, I mean, we had
a very busy quarter, and if you look at the page, I mean, you'll see that H&BC divestitures, that's done, and the North
American Fresh Bakery, it was the DOJ approval 10/21. And I'm very sorry and I apologize for the fact that it has been
a little bit slower than we had anticipated, but it's difficult to manage a process if you're not completely in control, but
we're very happy that it is now approved and you can expect the closing in the next couple of days. And this is very
good news.
The North American Refrigerated Dough, the deal is closed 10/3. Spanish Bakery was announced 10/10, and also, that
you can expect closure before the end of the year. I think the North American Beverage, which we announced last
week, also I think it was a very good deal, where we're very happy that our Coffee business in North America, which
was basically unbranded has now a very good home with Smucker, and its Folgers brand. And I think the deal,
completed with an association on our liquid technology, is a very good promise for the future. That remains with one
last one to close the box and tick the box, is the French Refrigerated Dough, which we expect also to be announced in
this quarter.
Okay, let me give you then a number two, I mean, we had a second promise, and that was about the organization. The
organizational structure, and I think what we said before that the organization will be finalized by December as you can
notice in the first line, we say here December, January. I gave myself a little bit of leeway, although I still think and
hope that we will be able to do everything in December. There is two open searches, the one is the CEO for MeatCo
and the other one is the General Counsel in the MeatCo Company.
In terms of the board I think we'll be ready to announce our Chairman of the MeatCo in December of this year and I'm
talking this calendar year of course. Then, in terms of our existing board members, we're currently going through the
process, which board member wants to share and wants to be in which board, and that will be announced at the latest
by mid-February. And then we'll have of course, the nomination of our new board members. We've started the process
of looking for additional board members to fill the places in either CoffeeCo or MeatCo in the coming half year, and
we expect some new members to be announced in next six to eight months. Okay.
Then going through detail of the organization, which I'm first of all, talking to MeatCo, I mean, if you change the page,
you will see there the org charts of our meat organization, and what you see is basically in the new organization we'll
have three new hires, three internal promotions and two people who are remaining in their positions. The three new
hires will be the CEO, the CFO, Maria Henry, who has been announced in July, and the General Counsel as I just
mentioned before.
If you look at the business part, I think there is two positions, which is the President and CMO, Monty Pooley who is
taking care of our marketing, our R&D, and our Food Service business and our Customer Officer, Andy Callaghan,
who is taking care of the retail, kind of i.e., sales business, sales organization. So, that is the new organization as it will
be in MeatCo and I think as I said before, we'll expect that this will be closed between December and January of this
year.
Going then to the org chart of Coffee, I mean, here you see in total five new hires out of which CEO, Michiel Herkemij
has been announced and he will start actually in December. We've recently announced our CFO, this is last week,
Michel Cup, who will join also on the 1st of December, but I'm glad to announce that he also already started, on a part

time basis, going into the details of the financials. So, I think that's very good news. And you will see a new name,
which we haven't announced so far, which is the CMO, Ingrid Baron. Ingrid, I'm very pleased to have her in the
organization. Ingrid started up the Energy in Motion process in CoffeeCo, as well as MeatCo in April of this year. She
is from an outside agency called IDEO and from origin she is an industrial designer. So, a very different background,
very innovative thinker and I expect great things of her going forward.
In terms of the business, how do we split up the business. There is three parts, we've split up the business in one side,
Western Europe, then the rest of the world and our out of home business or our food service business, respectively,
managed by Harm Jan van Pelt, which is an internal promotion. Marleen Vaesen, internal promotion, and Nick Snow
who has been handing food service for the last three to four years. So, I think a very solid way of looking forward in
our business and people who know our business and going forward, in a very positive way.
The third promise, which we made is innovations. We said that we would push our innovations, and I think if you look
at promise number three, I think great progress has made. I mean, as you know, with innovations they don't come from
one day to the other if they are a bit bigger. So, what we see on coffee is we will make significant, significant changes
in the next 12 to 24 months. In 24 months, you could expect that none of our packaging, none of our products will
probably look the same as they currently look.
You can expect the first re-launches in March-April of this year, and that will roll out. Then the big second wave of
innovations will happen in the summer and then major innovations, which is the bigger ones, can be expected in the
first half calendar '13 and hopefully even something already in the last half of calendar '12, most of which, and of
course, I can't announce everything, and we can't announce everything in our Investor Day, because I can't reveal all
the new things for competitive reasons. But most of the things we will be able to announce we will show and announce
in our Investor Day on February 29. Also I'm very glad to say that we've started intensified cooperation with Philips to
improve our appliance offering, which I think will be absolutely critical to move our Senseo business in a turbo charge.
Going to the innovations for Meat, new innovations also in the Meat business will start in spring. The first re-launch is
expected in Q4 so more or less at the same time, as you will see the first part of the Coffee in the – on the shelves.
Second wave, as with Coffee, you will see it in the summer. And significant changes in product portfolio, as well as
channel offerings to be expected from summer onwards. Also here in the first week of March when we'll have our
investor Day, you will see a lot of the innovations, which will be seen on shelf and again, you won't see everything, but
you will have a very, very good flavor of, that we've not being sitting still in the last four to five months.
Now I'd like to then move on to my personal to do list for the next seven months, and which I update all the time, but
there is a couple of recurring elements and I think the look for fixed costs will never stop and I think we're still looking
at that very, very aggressively to see whether we can reduce our fixed cost even further than the things we've promised
in our last quarter earnings results. The optimizing our portfolio, I mean, we're continuing to look at it. There are
always elements and parts, which I think are not fitting the strategy of profitable growth, there might be smaller things,
not necessarily big things, but I mean, we're looking at every portfolio, every brand, and in geographies to see what we
can do to make sure that we – when we start after our spin we really have our optimum portfolio.
The working capital, as you might have noticed, it's still not perfect. I mean, it's far from perfect, I would say, but we
can't push the organization on all the elements at the same time, so we're starting our project on working capital as of
Q3 and taking for Coffee or Meats where we're, respectively at kind of 18% to 19% of total sales. Our mid-term goal
would be to arrive at 5% working capital for the total Sara Lee Company and I think there is a lot of work to be done,
but we are full confident that we can make that.
Gross margins, absolute focus of the company. We'll look at how to make sure that our gross margins improve faster
than we currently have planned, and we're looking for ways to – first of all, procurement, we'll look at project squeeze,
which reduction of our variable cost, and we'll look at a lot of our mix and part of the portfolio change, that I've talked
about it before. Fit into the total strategy of making sure that we have the right mix, we've pushed the right products,
and we've pushed the right countries to making sure that our gross margins will see an uptick in the coming years. And
Mark and his team, and of course, all of us are working on an ideal capital structure for both companies, which is
work-in-progress in Q2/Q3, and we'll reveal the capital structure in our Investor Days in February and March,

respectively.
Then coming for the key milestones for the spin, before I pass it on to Mark for the financials. Important date will be
the IRS private letter ruling, end of calendar year 2011. Again, here we took a little bit of leeway, it's not completely
under our control, I mean, we would have to wait for the IRS to come back. Things happen not to go faster than
expected most of the time, but most of the time they take a little bit more time, so I hope the IRS is on the call and
make sure that they will [Laughter] help us a little bit to get the date as we would like it.
Finalize the organization, as I said before, December-January 2011-2012 that we'll hope to do in December, but don't –
don't be too upset if it becomes January. The full presentation of the strategy names, financial guidance, capital
structure, basically, what are these two pure-play companies going to do, what can you expect from them, will be
announced on our Investor Day on February 29 for CoffeeCo. Date, I mean, the exact place to be communicated. And it
will in Meats be the first week of March, we're aiming for the 8th of March, but we haven't gotten any – we're looking
for a specific location. So, the 8th of March, pencil it into your diary, that's what we're aiming for.
And then, the launch of the two new cos as said before, no changes whatsoever of what we've communicated before in
our earnings release, is the first half of calendar '12. That is as far as our to-do list and our update, and I would like to
now pass it on to Mark to take us through the financials. Mark?
Mark A. Garvey
Thanks, Jan, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to start by reviewing some of the key financial
highlights for the quarter. First, we are reaffirming the adjusted earnings per share guidance that we provided in August
of $0.89 to $0.95 a share. That range remains unchanged despite the headwinds from a weakening euro and the
divestiture of our North American Foodservice Beverage Business.
As you may recall, our guidance in August had assumed an exchange rate of $1.44 to the euro, the average rate for the
first quarter was actually just above $1.41, so we are now going to assume a rate of $1.38 for the remainder of the year,
basically an average of $1.39 for the full year. As we've discussed with you before, a $0.03 change in the dollar/euro
rate has an approximate impact of $0.01 to our earnings per share. We also announced the sale of the majority of our
North American Foodservice Beverage Business to Smucker recently. As such, we have moved this business into
discontinued operations in the quarter and restated prior year results so that our earnings per share guidance no longer
includes results from this business.
Now I'll talk you through the other key highlights as we show you the numbers for the quarter. Adjusted net sales for
the quarter rose 6% with strong pricing in all segments, as well as good mix results in Coffee & Tea. Overall volumes
were down in both major segments, but we did see improving volume trends in Coffee & Tea, compared to the fourth
quarter of fiscal '11. Also, be aware that our adjusted net sales of $1.9 billion now excludes $137 million in sales for
North American Foodservice Beverage, which has been moved to discontinued operations.
We continue to invest behind our brands and our MAP spending was up 27%, with significant increases both in North
American Retail and Coffee & Tea. Adjusted operating income was up 4% with strong results in Coffee & Tea, and the
benefit of lower corporate expenses coming through at corporate and in our North American segments.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.18, an increase of $0.06 or $0.50 – 50% from the prior-year quarter.
The increase in earnings per share resulted from improved adjusted operating income, slightly lower interest expenses,
as well as a reduced share count.
Now Marcel will provide an overview of the activity in the North American Meats and Coffee & Tea segments and will
provide some commentary around business segment performance. The schedules at the back of the earnings release
also provide information on the net sales and adjusted operating segment income for both Meats and Coffee & Tea.
We are pleased to see corporate expenses continue to come down as we move towards the spin. Here you can see the
general corporate expenses for the first quarter were 50% lower – over 50% lower than the same period in fiscal '11.

The reduction is due to reduced corporate department costs, as we manage cost down prior to the spin, and also, lower
pension costs. In reducing corporate department costs, we are comfortable that our corporate departments remain
adequately staffed to enable us to complete to spin.
On the other hand, there were commodity mark-to-market losses of $11 million in the quarter, compared to a gain of
$12 million in the prior-year quarter. On this slide, you can see the primary drivers of operating income for the first
quarter. Overall, pricing was ahead of commodities for the quarter, this was the case in the combined North American
segments, where pricing has exceeded our commodity comps now for three quarters.
In Coffee & Tea, excluding favorable mark-to-market currency benefits, pricing still trails commodity costs, but as we
have discussed before, this is expected to turn around in the second quarter.
There were also some commodity mark-to-market impacts in the quarter that I just discussed, the change was a
negative $23 million. MAP investment increased by $14 million on a constant-currency basis. And the other drivers of
operating income improvements came from improved mix results in Coffee & Tea, as well as lower selling, general,
and administrative expenses in the North American businesses and at corporate.
Now, I would like to turn to commodities in a little more detail. As you have seen, commodity costs increased by $153
million in the first quarter, compared to the same period last year. For the full year, we now expect commodity costs to
increase by $425 million. This number is lower than our August update of $500 million, primarily as we are not
including costs related to North American Beverage, which has now been moved to discontinued operations.
As we look out to the remainder of fiscal '12 for the Meats business, we see commodities, while historically high, are
tracking with our internal projections, and we are currently not anticipating any significant swings in our outlook. In
Coffee & Tea, the costs we incurred in the first quarter, excluding currency mark-to-market benefits, are expected to be
the highest for the year coming off the recent peak in coffee prices. We have mostly covered our coffee purchases for
the remainder of the year, and so we feel reasonably comfortable about our cost metrics for the fiscal year in Coffee.
Now our strategies to mitigate commodity cost increases remain the same, mainly to protect our margins through
pricing and productivity gains, continue to invest behind new innovations and to continue to look for opportunities to
further reduce costs.
The next slide shows our earnings per share as reported and as adjusted for continuing operations and for the total
company. For continuing operations we reported a net loss of $0.06 per share. This number was impacted by some
one-time items to our tax reserves, as well as costs associated with the spin and other restructuring charges. Backing
these costs out, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.18, as I've just discussed.
For the total company, including discontinued operations, there was a net loss of $0.37 reported. This number of
course, is impacted by gains on the sale of discontinued operations, in particular, the North American Refrigerated
Dough business sale in the quarter, and an impairment charge of approximately $370 million related to the movement
of Bakery Spain and France to discontinued operations.
As we discussed in our last quarterly call in August we are looking closely at both Meat company and Coffee company
to determine additional cost savings opportunities as we prepare for the spin. And as we previously reported we
continue to expect cost reduction opportunities of between $180 million and $200 million achievable in fiscal 2012 and
'13. These savings will help offset stranded overhead, which we estimate to be between $50 million to $60 million,
resulting from the disposition of businesses.
We now expect to incur $450 million to $475 million of significant items, not including impairments or gains or losses
on sales of businesses, in fiscal '12. These amounts include additional costs arising from anticipated actions, which will
be taken as a result of selling the majority of the North American Beverage Business to Smucker's. We estimate that the
after tax cash impact from these items will be approximately between $300 million and $350 million.
Now let me turn to cash flow and update you on anticipated year-end cash and debt balances. Net cash from operating
activities was an outflow of $220 million for the quarter, compared to an inflow of $28 million in the prior-year quarter.
This is primarily due to a one-time payment to the Dutch pension plan of €60 million, which was made in July. In

addition, we have significantly reduced cash flow from discontinued operations this quarter, compared to last year. And
finally, our working capital balances are higher, primarily due to significantly higher commodity costs.
At the end of fiscal '12 we now expect a cash balance of $300 million and gross debt of $2.1 billion. This represents an
improvement of approximately $200 million from our August guidance, which is primarily due to the additional
proceeds we will receive resulting from the North American Beverage disposition offset by the reduced proceeds from
the North American Fresh Bakery business. Again, for simplicity the year-end cash and debt balances assumes that the
spin-off occurs on the last day of this fiscal year. This also assumes the completion of sales related to all announced
dispositions, the payment of a $3 special dividend and the payment of the repatriation taxes for which we have already
provided.
We will provide you with regular updates on our expected year-end cash and gross debt positions as we progress
through fiscal '12 and as Jan said, at our Investor Day we will give you an update on the capital structures for both
companies.
For your own tax planning purposes, many of you have asked us in which calendar year the $3 special dividend will be
paid. We can confirm that we intend to pay the dividend in the first half of calendar year 2012 before completion of the
spinoff.
Finally, I would like to update you on our guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we are affirming our fiscal 2012 earnings
per share guidance of $0.89 to $0.95, and we are also affirming our adjusted operating income guidance of $875
million to $930 million. We are updating net sales guidance to $7.9 billion to $8.15 billion to take account of the
impact of moving the North American Beverage net sales into discontinued operations, and also, a weaker euro.
Consequently, net sales are now expected to increase by 4.5% to 8% over last year.
Net interest expense is now expected to be approximately $80 million for the year, an improvement of $5 million since
our last guidance. We continue to expect a tax rate for continuing operations of 33.4%. As I mentioned earlier, our
guidance now assumes an average euro rate for the year of $1.39.
So with that I will hand it over to Marcel, who will discuss the performance of our businesses.
Marcel H. M. Smits
Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everybody on the call. I'll be providing some color on the operating results from our
two businesses and let me begin on this side of the pond, with a review of our first quarter performance in Meats.
We've provided an overview of the financials for each segment in the quarter, and it's really part for reference – it's, in
part it's for reference purposes. So, I won't dwell on it too long. Let me just call out a couple of things, though. Sales
declined by 2% in the quarter, as pricing actions were offset by volume decreases. For the third straight quarter, pricing
actions, coupled with productivity gains enabled the business to offset commodity increases.
It's important to point out that we're lapping a strong volume quarter in the prior-year period in which the company
invested heavily in promotions. Volume was also impacted by early pricing actions and the rationalization of lower
margin promotions. During the first quarter we launched several new products under the Hillshire Farm brand,
including Grilled Essentials, Gourmet Creations and Deli Carvers, that will strengthen the Hillshire Farm franchise.
These innovations resulted in startup costs and MAP in the first quarter and will positively impact results in the
remainder of the year.
We committed to higher MAP spending, and we showed it in the first quarter with MAP up 13% behind new product
launches and a focus on building the core brands. For Ball Park we have meaningful innovation coming through later in
the year and Jimmy Dean is doing well. In all in the first quarter adjusted operating segment income was down 9% as
volume weakness and higher MAP investment offset SG&A savings and manufacturing efficiencies. The newly named
North American Foodservice & Specialty Meat segment comprises of the North American Foodservice Meat and
Bakery businesses, and the company's newly formed Specialty Meats business, currently comprised of Aidells and
Gallo. The North American Foodservice Beverage business is now reported as a discontinued operation and Gallo was

formerly reported in the Retail segment.
The reason for the formation of the new Specialty Meats Group is to accelerate growth in the Premium Meat segment.
This new group is being led by the Aidells management team. The Gallo business was successfully transitioned into the
Aidells management model and the management team has taken it over, and it is expected to benefit from Aidells
proven business model.
The Foodservice segment then reported its third straight quarter of adjusted net sales growth increasing 2% on pricing
actions across the portfolio. Volumes increased 2%, including the contribution from the Aidells acquisition. Excluding
Aidells, volumes declined 2% versus a strong prior-year quarter driven by soft restaurant traffic and declines in
Foodservice Bakery.
Adjusted operating segment income increased 7%, driven largely by manufacturing and SG&A savings. Adjusted
operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 9.6%. The Aidells brand outperformed expectations with 17% volume
growth and 22% sales growth. The company expects growth in Aidells to accelerate due to the expansion of
distribution across new geographies and customers.
Now that I've recapped the performance in Q1, let me just give you some color on the remainder of fiscal '12. First on
the volume, price and commodity cost equation. We've weathered some volume softness in key categories over the past
two quarters as we focused on pricing. To combat this volume softness, we will be taking precise pricing actions to
improve volumes and firm up shares in key strategic categories. We have numerous large platform innovations that will
benefit our results for the remainder of the year. We launched a few of these innovations under the Hillshire Farm
brand already in the first quarter.
In addition we're taking steps to accelerate the innovation that was developed by the Energy in Motion teams. And
finally, we continue to benefit from cost reductions taken over the past six months. We've now reduced head count by
over 400 in the North American business versus last year. The combination of these variables leave me very confident
that we will continue to perform in the coming months as we set this company up for our performance post spin.
Now let me move on to our Coffee & Tea segment then, formerly called International Beverage. This segment
encompasses our new Coffee & Tea company. These are the financials. The Coffee & Tea segment reported strong
adjusted top line performance of plus 14%, driven by pricing of 14% and positive sales mix of 4%. We continue to
expect that pricing will fully offset commodity inflation by the second quarter. Improvement in volume trends from the
previous quarter has declined, abated to 3%.
MAP increased 32% behind innovation and a renewed commitment to build the core brands. Adjusted operating
segment income was up 19% on pricing, positive mix and the benefit of new innovation, as well as currency
mark-to-market variances. Adjusted operating margin of 13.3% was up 60 basis points versus last year and 90 basis
points versus the fourth quarter of fiscal '11.
Although the Western European business continued to operate in challenging environments, these operations showed a
great improvement, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark improved
volume trends, compared to the preceding quarter.
L'OR EspressO meanwhile, continues to perform well in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and most notably in Spain
where it commands a 10.6% value share of the total retail coffee market only 20 weeks post launch.
Let's now look forward and I'll start by addressing the volume, price and commodity cost equation. Current price levels
should be sufficient to cover commodity inflation by the second quarter. As is true in North America, we have a healthy
pipeline of new product launches that will benefit results in the remainder of the year. A few examples of innovations
are L'OR EspressO and new machines coming through in Foodservice. And as we begin to see in the first quarter,
volume in R&G, in Roast & Ground, is rebounding.
As you saw in our first quarter numbers, we will continue to increase our investment in MAP to drive growth. We now
have our new organizational structure in place, and we're confident that our new management team will be successful
in driving further growth in the near term. With the organizational change comes a cultural change that will allow us to

move quickly in the market and accelerate the timeframe for new growth opportunities. So, we feel good about the
prospects for making a decent step-up in 2012.
With that, thank you, and with that said, let's move over to Q&As. Jan, Mark, Melissa and I will be happy to take your
questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Alexia Howard, your line is open and state
your company.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Yes, it's Sanford Bernstein. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning, Alexia.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Good morning, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: We've just had a conversation with Kellogg this morning and on that call they said that the
heavy cost-cutting that they concluded, or they conducted back in 2009, cut a little bit too deep and led to supply chain
and employee morale issues. Now, you're going through an awful lot of productivity improvement here as well and
have been for some time. What measures have you got in place to make sure that your own cost reduction initiatives
don't go too far?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Well, let me briefly speak to that. Our supply chain group, that's the biggest group in our
overall company, is doing very well. So, they are to be commended for continuing to deliver good results. We have a
very strong track record of bringing in lean savings, and everything we're seeing so far in the year is that we're actually
doing better than what we anticipated in our plan. So, that's supply chain, and that group is highly motivated, and they
are doing very well.
On the sales side, we've taken some cost reductions, because we've moved some of the smaller accounts over to a
brokerage share model. That has meant a lot of change. Obviously, the sales team is keen to make sure that we win in
the marketplace. They're excited about the fact that with surgical precision we're dialing back some of the price points,
and we're promoting a bit heavier, and that will help to win in the marketplace. So, I don't think that we have major
motivational issues there.
And then, of course, people in the office are saying, well, we're going to move downtown, at least that's what the
management preference is. That means quite a bit of change. So, we're spending a lot of time sharing with people the
vision for the future. We've had a big meeting on the 5th of October with something like 300 people in the room,
showing them what the innovation was going to be, what we were going to do in terms of changing channel strategy,
manufacturing strategy, and so on and henceforth. We then had another big meeting on the 18th of October. This
afternoon we're going to have a big meeting.
So for the people inside there's a lot of change going on, but I think we are becoming quite specific in terms of the
plans that we're executing in order to make the two companies successful and the plans and the specificity around the
plans give confidence and actually drive the motivation.
So we're obviously going through quite a bit of change, but we are thoughtful about how we do that, and we're trying to
keep everybody aligned and everybody on board by communicating extensively. And we're giving people the means to
be successful in the market. Last point that I will make is the fact that we're investing in new innovations, slotting,
MAP, that doesn't go unnoticed inside our organization. People are saying, well, that's good. So, overall I think we'll be
fine.

<A - Jan Bennink>: Perhaps I might add something; I mean, it's not necessarily cutting too deep; it's more to change
management we have to go through, because if you look at it, the last two to three years, Sara Lee has been through
enormous amount of change. So, it's not the cutting too deep, making sure that the people get the vision. And I think
what you've seen in the last, I would say, eight months, yes, has there been some distractions overall, yes, for sure, I
mean, more in North America probably than in the international Tea & Coffee business.
And I think now as Marcel said, they get clear what the future is going to like more and more, and you see the morale
actually ticking up. And also again internal monitors we're doing rather than having the – we had – in the summer we
had a pretty deep point, and I think we're ticking the box in terms of getting more positive in the last minute. I think it's
all about the strategy. I will say the Coffee & Tea is currently ahead of Meats because they've been through less, and
you will see a very positive spirit over there, and I'm sure that in Meats you will get exactly the same thing and you will
see that in the results.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Great.
<A - Jan Bennink>: But it's not really -
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Thanks.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Sure.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Thank you very much. That was very helpful. I'll pass it on.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, Jason English. Your line is open and state your company.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey. Good morning, folks. Jason English here. Thanks, in advance for the question and
congratulations on the progress made this past quarter. Couple of quick questions. First, the Australian Baking
business, I think you said it was under strategic review last quarter. Can you update us on the progress made there?
<A - Jan Bennink>: It continues to be under strategic review, Jason. Yeah, we have really nothing to add to that, at
this point.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: We're kind of indecisive.
<Q - Jason English>: All right. Fair enough. Moving on to Coffee, your Coffee business, Brazil looks like it was a
source of strength this quarter; I think it was a source of weakness last quarter. We don't have very good visibility into
that market. Can you tell us what's happening, some of the dynamics down in Brazil?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I think overall in Brazil, we've increased the prices in Brazil, and we went through, in the summer
we put our last price increase through in September. What you see there is overall the – our market share is picking up
despite the price increases. Everybody is following us. And I think very positively speaking, if you look at our key
brands, which is Pilão, which is about 65% is Damasco and Pilão, which is the more premium part and the higher
margin part, it's actually growing almost double-digit. I mean, we pulled a little bit back by the lower cost volumes, I
mean, the lower margin volumes, which is exactly what we would like to do, because we are not pushing at all on the
Cablocos and the low margin businesses. So, you see a healthy trend, pick-up of market share, and the competition
following price increases, which is a very positive signal.
<Q - Jason English>: Great. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.

Thank you. Next question, Tim Ramey. Your line is open and state your company.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Good morning, Tim.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: Good morning. Thanks. Trying to get my hands around the shift of the Specialty Meats
business, and what that does to the results we've known in the past. That appears to have been a high margin segment
that you moved over. First of all, what's – give me the rationale again on that? I mean, why doesn't that belong in the
Meat business? And second, what should we be thinking about in terms of margin performance for what is the new
retail Meats business?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Okay, just a couple of questions here. What we've done, Tim, is we've moved Gallo over
to the Aidells business. The Aidells business is – it's more of a premium business. We have always considered Gallo to
be a hold brand in which we didn't invest all that much, fairly profitable for us, but sales have not been increasing on a
brand basis over the last few years. And when we brought Aidells in, we actually brought in a company that was
excited about Gallo as a business, saw lots of opportunities, so we gave them that business, integrated the two, and then
are applying the Aidells models to the Gallo business. So, we're turning Gallo into a growth engine. We're going
through a number of reformulations. We're gaining some distribution, and we're going to apply the same Aidells'
demonstration model that has served us very well. So, that's where we are.
The Aidells business meanwhile, under the Aidells brands, keeps performing very well. Gallo had a decent quarter in
the first year. It's very small, it's really a rounding, but we have some – we have high hopes that can be real successful
under this new leadership team.
Leadership team – we've put it together. We've looked at how we should define the segments, and it felt that it was
better to keep it separate. So, we're keeping it separate from our retail organization, and we're looking at it top down
level on an integrated basis between our Foodservice business and the Aidells-Gallo business. It's too small to cut it out
as a separate segment. So, that's where we put it. Does that give you an answer to your question?
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: Well -
<A - Jan Bennink>: It's a little bit different business model and kind of just agent for change. I mean, people see how
we can do business differently and I think that's another very good signal to the organization, I mean, kind of keep it
different. The one who was running it – the person who was running it did it perfectly, and so you give a great example.
It's on a roll.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: It answers part of the question. The other part of the question was how should we think
about margins in what is the new retail Meats business. And just to follow up on your answer there, I mean, Aidells, as
I recall, is a Costco model essentially, does that mean Gallo will become a Costco model, and why is a Costco model
sort of not a retail business?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Aidells is, I wouldn't say it's a Costco model, it's a business that actually has a very strong
franchise in Costco. It's built quite a bit of equity in Costco. It's now increasingly rolling out outside Costco. That's
where we, as a company, are making contributions there, because we're opening doors for the management teams, for
the Aidells' management team, that were difficult to penetrate in the past.
Yes. I think you can have an argument then to see as to whether or not it should be part of retail Meat or should sit
somewhere else. We in the end decided that we'd put it – it's a separate business, we don't want to disclose it separately
because it's too small. So, it doesn't meet the hurdles to disclose it separately, we put into Specialty Meat. We tend to
look at the Meat company as a whole, which is what we've done in the release, well we've added the figures up because
that's the way we're starting to look at, what's the Meat business, and what's the Coffee business.
Then in terms of your margin objectives, yes, we're clearly trying to drive the margins in our Meat business up, and
that's a function of a whole range of things. That's a function of innovation coming through, mix management further
saves on the COGS side. So, there is a whole range of initiatives; we clearly have an objective to drive margins further
up. I don't think we should go into specifics of what those margin objectives are, there will be another moment, but up
is the direction where we're going.

Thank you. Your next question, Akshay Jagdale. Your line is open and state your company, please.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Thank you. It's KeyBanc. My first question is for Jan. I just wanted to ask you about your
exit from the single-serve market in the U.S. I mean, is that a, would you call that a regional issue, category, meaning
single-serve or brand, or is it something else?
<A - Jan Bennink>: It is completely a regional issue. I mean, we were a fly on the window screen here in the U.S. I
think it's a very small business. We would have had to invest a hell of a lot of money in order to get in here, it's a very
competitive market. And I think the money is better spent in areas where we can have a bigger bang for our buck. I
think we're completely, but completely committed to the single-serve, as you will notice in the next 12 to 18 months,
and as I also said about looking at ways of expanding our cooperation with Phillips. There is a full commitment to our
single-serve, completely a regional issue and I think the market is currently too full for us.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Perfect. And just a follow-up on that. You mentioned intensified cooperation with Phillips,
if you can, could you expand on that? I mean, if you don't want to be too specific, at least help us understand
strategically how important you think the machines are in the whole scheme of your business?
<A - Jan Bennink>: We'll update, kind of, we're in negotiations to see how we can cooperate more together. We will
update – give you an update in the next hopefully months where we want to go, what we want to do. Having a very
cooperative innovative partner next to you to make the single-serve a success, I mean, as I said before, our Senseo
machine looks the same as 10 years ago. I mean, that is a result of both partners. And I think what we want to do is
making sure that we have a wide array of machines, and we're talking about single-serve and perhaps also other types
of machines and single-serve ways. So, is it important in our strategy going forward? Absolutely, and we just want to
make sure that we are – both partners are completely in the same boat, and we will give you an update on that one,
hopefully very soon.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Okay. And one last one for Marcel, I think this will go to you. On the North American retail
Meat volumes, one is, did they disappoint? I mean, they seem pretty weak in terms of the trends. And can you just
comment on category dynamics there? I mean, where is that weakness coming from, is it Deli, or anything, any color
you can give on that, that will be great?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Let me just give you a couple of perspectives. First of all, I think it's an important point to
note that last year in the first quarter we actually had a fairly heavily promoted quarter. So, from a pricing point of view
in a number of categories, we were competitive at the time. And then as we saw commodity prices coming up and got
visibility on those commodity prices sticking, we then said, look, we have to protect our margin structures. So, we've
been taking pricing up quite aggressively. In some areas, we've gradually been followed; in other areas, we haven't, and
that's one piece of the dynamic.
The other piece of the dynamic is that we need to bring more innovation to the market, which is exactly what we've
done in the first quarter, and so the Deli Carvers, the Gourmet Creations and the new products that we've just
mentioned. So, that will help to drive and improve the volume trend. And that's innovation that's coming through apart
from the Energy in Motion innovation, which will start hitting us, or, which will start coming through in the fourth
quarter of this year and then accelerate in 2013. So, it's a function of pricing and innovation, and we're correcting on
both sides, we're pushing quite a bit of innovation through already in the first quarter, and we're making sure that will

accelerate as we go through the year. That's one.
And secondly, from a pricing point of view, to the extent that we see competitors not reflecting the same commodity
realities that we see, with surgical precision, we'll defend our share.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Perfect. Thank you. I'll pass it along.

Thank you. Next question... one moment, please. Thank you. We have Priya Ohri-Gupta. Your line is open and state
your company.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Hello.
<Q - Priya Ohri-Gupta>: – file your Form 10. Hello?
Operator
Okay. Priya your line is now open, go ahead, please.
<Q - Priya Ohri-Gupta>: Sorry about that.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Priya, we missed the first part of the question. Sorry.
<Q - Priya Ohri-Gupta>: That's okay. I'm calling from Barclays Capital. Wanted to know when you expect to file the
Form 10. And secondly, as you sort of look to put your capital structures in place for the two entities, have you given
some thought to how could potentially address sort of putting your respective debt at each of the entities, i.e., through
sort of a tender, a refinancing or potentially an exchange? Thank you.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Hi, it's Mark Garvey here. We're working very hard right now to get ready for filing this
Form 10. As you know, it's quite a bit of work. Our expectation currently is probably early February, is our current
timeline to get that filed. So, all going to plan, that's where we should be. And yes, we've been giving a lot of thought to
capital structure in terms of where we will end up with the two companies. We will certainly be giving a full update on
that at the Investor Day. But based on where we currently are, you would expect that we will raise some debt in the
Coffee company. And we will do potentially some tenders here in the North American area as well. So, we haven't
fully determined all of that yet, but you will be getting more updates on that fairly shortly.
<Q - Priya Ohri-Gupta>: Thank you very much.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: You're welcome.

<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Morning, Eric.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hi, Eric.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, I guess the first question has to do with your comments about how your Coffee pricing
looking forward is now kind of covering the cost, and so I would have thought that that would have been pretty positive

because that's been something that you've been like kind of playing catch-up on for a couple of quarters. Is it that
currency has gone the other way, and that's why the consolidated forecast for fiscal EPS is just kind of staying where it
is?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Eric, no, we've been predicting, I think, for a number of quarters that we felt we would catch
up by the second quarter in terms of our pricing versus coffee commodity costs. And we took some decisions over the
last two or three months as well to make sure we were pretty well covered for the year. So, we have reasonable
confidence where we are right now from a pricing perspective that we should be ahead of commodities, and we should
have a good metric on that for the year. But it's not a currency factor. This is something that we've been really trying to
get through to the retail environment. As Jan said, this quarter we got all of our pricing basically through in the
different countries as well, so that's what gives us the confidence.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Second, it looks like you lifted advertising or MAP spend a very big amount, but you
didn't get a lot of bang for your buck in terms of volume. I guess, do you think that that starts to have a tail with an ROI
and volume starts to rebound, or is that kind of what's necessary versus kind of, it sounds like a pretty aggressive new
product launch, and that's what gets the volumes back over the next couple of quarters?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Right. I mean, if you look at the MAP spend, and I'm taking Coffee and Marcel will take the
Meats part, because there are definitely different answers for that. If you look at the Coffee, I think the MAP spend was
up 31%. I mean, but very interestingly now, I mean, you see the mix and one of the results of the MAP spend is that we
pushed a lot of the products with higher margins. So, the mix part is a very positive signal.
Also, you will recall probably better than anybody else that our minus 9% in Q4 versus a minus 3%. And if I even take
the private labels out in Q1, we are ending up with minus 1.5% in terms of volume on branded goods. So, that is,
overall the trend in the volume is actually a very positive one, and that's the trend we expect to continue to be positive
going forward. That's in concerning, so, we're pushing on higher mix – higher margin products. We're turning the
corner on the volumes, we see that the private labels and other ones are following us in terms of pricing, and we feel
more confident that currently the market is playing out pretty well for us.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: On Meats.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes. On the Meats side, Eric, basically what we've done is we've pushed a number of new
products into the market. So, we've incurred quite a bit of slotting expenses, which sits in our gross profit, and we've
incurred MAP expenses, which show – is visible on the MAP line.
And as we have launched these products in the course of the quarter, we were anticipating that we'd have a major
contributions of those products in this particular quarter. Those contributions of those products will come through as
the year progresses.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And if I could just follow up with Mark on the cash flow and the balance sheet for the
fiscal year-end assumptions. It's seems generally that what you've been selling has come through at least less than what
I expected and obviously, there was a DOJ required adjustment for the bread disposition in the U.S. So, how do we – is
it that cash flow from operations are coming through better than expected, that there isn't much change in the net debt
assumptions by year-end? I mean, kind of how do we bridge the lower proceeds versus kind of whatever operating cash
is being generated?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Well, Eric, when we give – and I'm sure you know this, but you know on the last quarter we
did not include the North American Foodservice Beverage proceeds, right, in what we had given you from a gross debt
perspective. So, that obviously is additional proceeds that we have. Clearly, the offset in North American Fresh Bakery
to some extent reduces that. There are also some favorabilities coming through in cash flow from ops, which are
helping the numbers there as well. So, overall – I'm not trying to bridge every single number because that's not what we
think we should do. But we're coming in a little bit better than what we expected. It's mostly, though, the North
American Beverage proceeds have helped us there.

Thank you. Our next question, Robert Moskow. Your line is open and state your company.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. Credit Suisse.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Good morning, Robert.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hey, Rob.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning, Robert.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Good morning. Hey, I just wanted to maybe dive a little bit more into the Coffee margins.
They're still low at 13.2%, and it's clear that you're pointing in an upward direction. But, how long do you think it takes
to get back to like that normalized level of 18%?
[Laughter]
And do you think that there's a risk that with Coffee prices kind of rolling over a little bit that some of your competition
starts to lower price, causing you to take some more pricing actions in the other direction? Thanks.
<A - Jan Bennink>: First of all, let me correct you. We've never used 18% in any of our previous – no, we said to
historical levels. You put them at 18%, I mean, that's your call. But definitely ,there's an upward trend in terms of the
margins and I think we feel comfortable in getting back. How long does it take us to get back? I mean, I won't give a
precise number, but I think we're looking at, as I always said, this is the year of transition, next year will be a building
year and the growth here will be 2000, and whatever – in 2013, I think it is, two year, two fiscals from now. So, it's
about – that is probably the moment where you will see both top line, as well as the bottom line in line with the
expectations. So, it's more of a mid-term guidance.
How fast can we go back? I think the prices, as you currently see it, and is put a note in our six months, kind of six to
nine months coverage, which we have with Coffee, we feel pretty comfortable that we can get to better levels than we
have now in this particular quarter, because the prices in Coffee were a record high. This is a really, on a free flow
basis, which we take; I mean, this is the Coffee prices at $2.85, which is the highest level we had. So, they will get
better; I mean, we expect margins to grow.
Will there be price pressure coming in from the competition? So far we haven't seen it, I mean, since prices have been
going up and down. There might be some coming up. We've anticipated for that. I mean, we do not want to decrease
our margins. I think we are far away from the margins where we were in an historical level. So, margins and percentage
margins I'm talking, not about absolute margins, is the name of the game in the company. So, we'll push the percentage
margins, and that will happen via, perhaps on a short-term, we will some promotional activities if there's some activity
in private labels. But the way going forward, is innovate our way out, and I think the route to market, what we have
starting in April-May next year gives me a lot of confidence that we can tackle additional margin enhancement on our
Roast & Ground business, as well as in our single-serve business. So, I don't feel particularly stressed by it.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Can I ask a question about the internal goal on percentage margins rather than dollar margins?
It seems like your competition really focuses more on dollar margins. What do you think that the – how do you think
that will affect the competitive dynamic in the categories, if one is focusing on one thing and the other's focusing on the

other, or does it matter?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Luckily ,we don't have one competitor. I mean, if you look at our competitive markets, in Brazil,
our competitor is Strauss, in the Benelux, our competitors – and in Spain, our competitor is private label, in France, our
competitor is Kraft, in the Eastern European market, our competitor is Kraft, and to a certain extent Nestlé. So, it is a
very different marketplace with different kind of competitors in different markets. So, overall, private labels will focus
more on penny profits.
The, interestingly enough, because of all the price increases, what you see is we, as a coffee brand, since we're the
leaders most of the places where we play, we will use as a loss leader and the trade didn't make any money on us. With
the higher prices, all of a sudden we've become a very interesting category for the trade and, our brand specifically has
become more interesting. So, the trade all of a sudden starts pushing us more rather than own their private labels
because they started making more money on us.
So it's not one dynamic and in the end, by the innovations, by looking at it, I mean, we've done it in the past with
margins, which are high, will we get to the similar margins as we were in the long time past? I mean, that will probably
be difficult, but actually I mean, I feel – and I feel more and more confident definitely with the raw material prices that,
and the innovation pipeline – that we can get to where we've stated that we can be, I mean, more than ever.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Thank you, Jan.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Okay.

Thank you. Next question, Rob Dickerson. Your line is open, and state your company, please.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Consumer Edge Research.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Good morning.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. Just I have a few questions. I guess to start, on North American Coffee, Foodservice,
what was new there, what was the rationale of not telling us that may be coming when you reported last quarter?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I think the reason for not telling you is because we were looking for the best strategic option to go
forward and I think just selling a business, I mean, was it selling, was it not selling. There's a lot of people involved
here in North America, and also, for the internal organization I think it would have been a pretty heavy burden on top
of all the changes we have. So, there were more internal reasons than external reasons not to announce here.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes. I think there is no point in announcing things if you not 100% sure that you can take
them across the finish line. So -
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And then just off of that, I know you didn't change guidance
today for the year, but I'm assuming obviously just due to the low profitability of the Foodservice Coffee business that
the $0.75 base doesn't change from last year?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes. That's correct. The $0.75 base doesn't change. It was a low profit really last year. We
had plans for it to be, frankly, more profitable this year. So, it did impact how I did my guidance calculation. But you're
right, last year's base did not change.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. Perfect. And then, I think your back-to-school, you threw out some kind of rough growth
targets for CoffeeCo, now that you're selling Foodservices, any of that change, or we're still standard plan?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: We are staying on track.

<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. Perfect. And then next question, this is more, I guess on cost savings. I know you've laid
out before product accelerate should be about $60 million incremental this year, corporate savings were about $35
million incremental, your stranded overhead seems to be staying the same. But a few of the moving parts, for at least
fiscal '12, was originally you called out pension savings. I thought it was a $46 million, was that – does that stay the
same or is that now go down some?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes. Pension versus last year was about $40 million-plus favorable, as I think it was about
$44 million, is the last number I saw. We did some adjustments because of the dispositions. On the other hand, of
course, we had anticipated we were going to get some amortization and savings, which we will get much less of those
now because we have those in discontinued operations.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. Got it. And then – sorry.
<A - Jan Bennink>: In a way – sorry to interrupt. In a way what we've been saying on – also on the roadshow, I think,
there's a lot of moving parts and the moving parts are getting less and less. But, I think, and the way you look at this
business, it's very simple. We've given kind of how the Meat business will look in the future, how the CoffeeCo will
look in the future, and what's in the middle will be taken care of. I think that's how you should look at it. Very simply,
two great straight-forward pure play companies and the rest in the middle, is basically, that's the people – the three
people at the table, it's their task to make sure it disappears.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Yes, no, I – completely understood. I'm just trying, it's also important for us to get our hands
around the actual numbers. So – and then back to the actual cost savings, I thought you said about $10 million to $15
million-ish for this fiscal year, but it looked like in Q1, you already had a $10 million benefit in corporate expense, in
general corporate. So, is there a potential for cost savings to even be higher in corporate than you had originally
expected?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes, we're making good progress on corporate and the thing we, as we focus in on corporate
is that we need to make sure we get to the finish line obviously, to get there with the spin. But to the extent that there
are additional savings, we will pass them on, but I think the $180 million to $200 million savings that we've quoted is
what you should think through. My earlier comment said that we continue to look at both Coffee and Meat in terms of
savings opportunities, some of which if we feel appropriate we'll pass through, some we will invest into businesses.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. And then lastly -
<A - Melissa Napier>: Rob, it's Melissa, just, I know we have a few other people in the queue. So, if there's further
questions, you can follow up with IR later if that's okay, and we will get to the rest of the people in the queue.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. And maybe I can get Marcel on the phone, too. That would be great. Thanks.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Okay.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Thanks.

I guess what I want to understand is just from a bigger picture standpoint, you have couple – you had divestitures this
quarter that came out of your guidance and – discontinued ops, I should say, and you had foreign exchange a little less
than you thought, and I quantify that at around $50 million, five zero. I'm just curious, within, holding your guidance,
what helps overcome that? I guess I'm not clear on that. I saw like amortization was lower than I thought, corporate was
a little lower than I thought. Was there anything else within the business units that gave you a little more comfort to
keep that guidance in place?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes, I think as we're seeing the results come through, Coffee certainly we're – we're very
happy with the results there. We feel we've peaked on the commodity side. We've got our pricing through. We have a
bit more confidence, I would say, standing here today than we did, let's say, three months ago. So – and there are lot of
moving pieces, as you can imagine, Chris, but when I put them all together I feel that despite the headwinds we have on
currency, taking out Foodservice Beverage, you're right, corporate is coming in less than expected and I think Coffee is
also doing fine. So, that's giving me the comfort that we can hold the guidance.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. My final question is in relation to, I guess a general question about pricing and I
was struck by a comment that Marcel made about, I think in Meats where maybe you're going to get a little more
promotional, it sounded like, to support some better volumes there, if input costs allow. Is that something that we
should expect maybe, your pricing to more closely track less aggressive inflation in, say the second half of the year? Is
that a reasonable assumption for the business, especially in Meats?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yes, I think, Chris, what you're seeing is in the Meat business we are going through very
significant cost saves. I've counted out a number of SCEs that we've reduced. We're going through cost saves on the IT
infrastructural side. The company has been put on the mode of let's now get to the leanest, meanest cost platform that
we can get to. So, we're confident that we will actually do well on a cost side. And that allows us to be tactical in those
areas where it's required. We have consistently said, we think that we need to reflect commodity prices in our consumer
prices in order to protect the margin structure, both for us and for the trade. Long-term, it's not a path that you can go
down to let that erode. Most of our competitors seem to – or a number of our competitors seem to reflect those same
realities. And in some areas, we don't see that happening, and we're not going to sit on our hands and see people
running away with our ball, so we can afford it, and we will spend back.
Now, the real solution of course, is to out innovate and the products that we've pushed into the market in the first
quarter, that's a first step. The products that we're pushing into the market this year as a result of the ongoing innovation
pipeline are bigger innovations than what we've pushed through last year. But that's helpful, and over and above that,
the Energy in Motion innovations will have to accelerate the top line. So, we're going to be a bit tactical. We can afford
to be a bit tactical, because we've got cost favorability and meanwhile, the strategic answer is let's make sure that we've
got great innovation coming through, because that will, long-term, carry the day.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yes.

Thank you. Our last question comes from Andrew Lazar. Your line is open, and state your company, please.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good afternoon, Barclays Capital.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Hi, Andrew.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hey, Andrew.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Hi, just two quick things, first Jan, broadly speaking, if we look back on, I guess the Coffee &
Tea business maybe two years from now, how do you think the geographic split looks versus today, because I think the

high single-digit sales growth agenda that you're thinking about for this business over time, I would think almost
necessitates a lot of change on that front? No?
<A - Jan Bennink>: No, not really. There will be change. I think the rest of the world will be a bigger part of the pie, I
mean, how big exactly, we'll try and give you an answer on that one in February. But I do expect that Western Europe
will accelerate significantly. I mean, do not expect that because we think Western Europe is kind of the rust bin of the
world, I mean, that it doesn't – can't grow. I think really the way we've been treating our business in Western Europe it
can grow. And Spain is currently our fastest growing business, followed by France, Holland is getting there, Belgium to
follow, Germany having good growth. So, I think actually that, yes, they will be a higher part of the business in the rest
of the world. It's currently 27%, but growth will come from both ends.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay, that's helpful. And then last thing, just, it was intriguing the sort of innovation R&D, sort
of JV arrangement you have, I guess with Smucker as part of this deal announced last week. And I'm trying to get a
sense, whatever you can share around that, what brought you to that place, is it broader than just Foodservice, does it
extend to the overall Coffee business, branded for both players in each region? And is it a right of first refusal
situation? A little bit more around that, because it's a fairly unique arrangement.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yep, Marcel will -
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Let me give you some insight on that. I've been – over the summer I've participated in a
number of those discussions. So, what we did is we took the Smucker's people – to whom we took a real liking by the
way – we took them over to Europe to [indiscernible] (66:23) to our R&D center and said this is what we have in the
pipeline. And they have a view that liquid coffee can play a really supplementary role to their overall presence. They
have a view that they want to grow in food service , and when they saw the pipeline they said, oh, that's really exciting.
And we said, well, we are keen to bring you on board, because obviously that pipeline of us just becomes easier to
sustain and bring to market if we have a larger business, which takes the fruit of that labor into the markets. The U.S.
market is a big market. So, we're very keen to see products coming through in the U.S. market.
It means that we'll sell more machines, it means that we'll get access to lower machine prices. And basically what we've
done is we've agreed with Smucker's that they will support us on an ongoing basis with the R&D expenditure that we're
incurring, and to the extent that they become very successful in combining their innovation, or our innovation with their
brand, we get to share in that lift. So, we're really sitting here hoping that they're going to be phenomenally successful,
that the combination of our technology and their brand will prove to be a major hit, because then we will have a – what
is for us say a relevant financial upside, apart from the fact that we'll have more mass. So, we're excited about that.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. Does it go beyond Foodservice, Marcel, that's the only thing I wasn't sure of.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Well, we might me.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: It may be. We haven't – but we don't compete in geography. So, we tend to look into each
other's cards and say, hey, there's interesting stuff in there, what can we do together?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: You can think of a lot of things, I mean, from technology to R&D to, even go as far as
procurement. So, I mean, there might be ways to go. I think we'll first have to see how well we get together, seems all
good, and there is – it's an open door.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Yes. They're good folks. Thank you.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Thanks.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Thank you.
